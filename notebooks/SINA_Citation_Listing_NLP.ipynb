       "The dependence of development and homeostasis in animals on the interaction of hundreds of extracellular regulatory proteins with the peri- and extracellular glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate (HS) is exploited by many microbial pathogens as a means of adherence and invasion. Heparin, a widely used anticoagulant drug, is structurally similar to HS and is a common experimental proxy. Exogenous heparin prevents infection by a range of viruses, including S-associated coronavirus isolate HSR1. Here, we show that heparin inhibits severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) invasion of Vero cells by up to 80% at doses achievable through prophylaxis and, particularly relevant, within the range deliverable by nebulisation. Surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrate that heparin and enoxaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin which is a clinical anticoagulant, bind and induce a conformational change in the spike (S1) protein receptor-binding domain (S1 RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. A library of heparin derivatives and size-defined fragments were used to probe the structural basis of this interaction. Binding to the RBD is more strongly dependent on the presence of 2-O or 6-O sulfate groups than on N-sulfation and a hexasaccharide is the minimum size required for secondary structural changes to be induced in the RBD. It is likely that inhibition of viral infection arises from an overlap between the binding sites of heparin/HS on S1 RBD and that of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. The results suggest a route for the rapid development of a first-line therapeutic by repurposing heparin and its derivatives as antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 and other members of the Coronaviridae.    2451\n",

recommendations for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of the most common thrombotic complications in COVID19, including acute myocardial infarction AMI, ischemic stroke, and venous thromboembolism VTE,Importance Cardiac injury with attendant negative prognostic implications is common among patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 infection Whether cardiac injury, including myocarditis, also occurs with asymptomatic or mildseverity COVID19 infection is uncertain There is an ongoing concern about COVID19associated cardiac pathology among athletes because myocarditis is an important cause of sudden cardiac death during exercise Observations Prior to relaxation of stayathome orders in the US, the American College of Cardiologys Sports and Exercise Cardiology Section endorsed empirical consensus recommendations advising a conservative returntoplay approach, including cardiac risk stratification, for athletes in competitive sports who have recovered from COVID19 Emerging observational data coupled with widely publicized reports of athletes in competitive sports with reported COVID19associated cardiac pathology suggest that myocardial injury may occur in cases of COVID19 that are asymptomatic and of mild severity In the absence of definitive data, there is ongoing uncertainty about the optimal approach to cardiovascular risk stratification of athletes in competitive sports following COVID19 infection Conclusions and Relevance This report was designed to address the most common questions regarding COVID19 and cardiac pathology in athletes in competitive sports, including the extension of returntoplay considerations to discrete populations of athletes not addressed in prior recommendations Multicenter registry data documenting cardiovascular outcomes among athletes in competitive sports who have recovered from COVID19 are currently being collected to determine the prevalence, severity, and clinical relevance of COVID19associated cardiac pathology and efficacy of targeted cardiovascular risk stratification While we await these critical data, early experiences in the clinical oversight of athletes following COVID19 infection provide an opportunity to address key areas of uncertainty relevant to cardiology and sports medicine practitioners,In coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases are major risk factors for critical disease progression However, the underlying causes and the effects of the main antihypertensive therapies—angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors ACEIs and angiotensin receptor blockers ARBs—remain unclear Combining clinical data nu2009u2009144 and singlecell sequencing data of airway samples nu2009u200948 with in vitro experiments, we observed a distinct inflammatory predisposition of immune cells in patients with hypertension that correlated with critical COVID19 progression ACEI treatment was associated with dampened COVID19related hyperinflammation and with increased cell intrinsic antiviral responses, whereas ARB treatment related to enhanced epithelialimmune cell interactions Macrophages and neutrophils of patients with hypertension, in particular under ARB treatment, exhibited higher expression of the proinflammatory cytokines CCL3 and CCL4 and the chemokine receptor CCR1 Although the limited size of our cohort does not allow us to establish clinical efficacy, our data suggest that the clinical benefits of ACEI treatment in patients with COVID19 who have hypertension warrant further investigation,Rationale The impact of coronavirus disease COVID19 on patients with interstitial lung disease ILD has not been establishedObjectives To assess outcomes in patients with ILD hospitalized for COVID19 versus those without ILD in a contemporaneous age, sex, and comorbiditymatched populationMethods An international multicenter audit of patients with a prior diagnosis of ILD admitted to the hospital with COVID19 between March 1 and May 1, 2020, was undertaken and compared with patients without ILD, obtained from the ISARIC4C International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium cohort, admitted with COVID19 over the same period The primary outcome was survival Secondary analysis distinguished idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis from nonidiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ILD and used lung function to determine the greatest risks of deathMeasurements and Main Results Data from 349 patients with ILD across Europe were included, of whom 161 were admitted to the hospital with laboratory or clinical evidence of COVID19 and eligible for propensity score matching Overall mortality was 49 79161 in patients with ILD with COVID19 After matching, patients with ILD with COVID19 had significantly poorer survival hazard ratio HR, 160 confidence interval, 117218 Pu2009u20090003 than age, sex, and comorbiditymatched

pandemic It is unclear whether patients with COPD are at increased risk of becoming infected with SARSCoV2 During periods of high community prevalence of COVID19, spirometry should only be used when it is essential for COPD diagnosis andor to assess lung function status for interventional procedures or surgery Patients with COPD should follow basic infection control measures, including social distancing, hand washing, and wearing a mask or face covering Patients should remain up to date with appropriate vaccinations, particularly annual influenza vaccination Although data are limited, inhaled corticosteroids, longacting bronchodilators, roflumilast, or chronic macrolides should continue to be used as indicated for stable COPD management Systemic steroids and antibiotics should be used in COPD exacerbations according to the usual indications Differentiating symptoms of COVID19 infection from chronic underlying symptoms or those of an acute COPD exacerbation may be challenging If there is suspicion for COVID19, testing for SARSCoV2 should be considered Patients who developed moderatetosevere COVID19, including hospitalization and pneumonia, should be treated with evolving pharmacotherapeutic approaches as appropriate, including remdesivir, dexamethasone, and anticoagulation Managing acute respiratory failure should include appropriate oxygen supplementation, prone positioning, noninvasive ventilation, and protective lung strategy in patients with COPD and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome Patients who developed asymptomatic or mild COVID19 should be followed with the usual COPD protocols Patients who developed moderate or worse COVID19 should be monitored more frequently and accurately than the usual patients with COPD, with particular attention to the need for oxygen therapy,,OBJECTIVE Previous studies that evaluated cardiovascular risk factors considered age as a potential confounder We aimed to investigate the impact of cardiovascular disease CVD and its risk factors on fatal outcomes according to age in patients with COVID19 METHODS A systematic literature review and metaanalysis was performed on data collected from PubMed and Embase databases up to 11 June 2020 All observational studies case series or cohort studies that assessed inhospital patients were included, except those involving the paediatric population Prevalence rates of comorbid diseases and clinical outcomes were stratified by mean patient age in each study ranges 50 years, 5060 years and 60 years The primary outcome measure was a composite fatal outcome of severe COVID19 or death RESULTS We included 51 studies with a total of 48u2009317 patients with confirmed COVID19 infection Overall, the relative risk of developing severe COVID19 or death was significantly higher in patients with risk factors for CVD hypertension OR 250, 95 CI 215 to 290 diabetes 225, 95 CI 189 to 269 and CVD 311, 95 255 to 379 Younger patients had a lower prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and CVD compared with older patients however, the relative risk of fatal outcomes was higher among the former CONCLUSIONS The results of the metaanalysis suggest that CVD and its risk factors hypertension and diabetes were closely related to fatal outcomes in COVID19 for patients across all ages Although young patients had lower prevalence rates of cardiovascular comorbidities than elderly patients, relative risk of fatal outcome in young patients with hypertension, diabetes and CVD was higher than in elderly patients PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER CRD42020198152,BACKGROUND Severe coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is characterized by an increased risk of thromboembolic events, with evidence of microthrombosis in the lungs of deceased patients OBJECTIVES To investigate the mechanism of microthrombosis in COVID19 progression PATIENTSMETHODS We assessed von Willebrand factor VWF antigen VWFAg, VWF ristocetincofactor VWFRCo, VWF multimers, VWF propeptide VWFpp, and ADAMTS13 activity in a crosssectional study of 50 patients stratified according to their admission to three different intensity of care units low requiring highflow nasal cannula oxygenation, nxa0xa014, intermediate requiring continuous positive airway pressure devices, nxa0xa017, and high requiring mechanical ventilation, nxa0xa019 RESULTS Median VWFAg, VWFRCo, and VWFpp levels were markedly elevated in COVID19 patients and increased with intensity of care, with VWFAg being 268, 386, and 476xa0IUdL VWFRCo 216, 334, and 388xa0IUdL and VWFpp 156, 172, and 192xa0IUdL in patients at low, intermediate, and high intensity of care, respectively Conversely, the hightolow molecularweight VWF multimers ratios progressively decreased with increasing intensity of care, as well as median ADAMTS13 activity levels, which ranged from 82xa0IUdL for patients at low intensity of care to 62 and 55xa0IUdL for those at intermediate and high intensity of care CONCLUSIONS We found a significant alteration of the VWFADAMTS13 axis in COVID19 patients, with an elevated VWFAg to ADAMTS13 activity ratio that was strongly associated with disease severity Such an imbalance enhances the hypercoagulable state of COVID19 patients and their risk of microthrombosis,Abstract Coronavirus disease‐19 COVID‐19 is a new disease caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 Since the beginning of 2020, it has become one of the main challenges of our times, causing a high incidence of severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS, multiorgan failure and death1 At the root of COVID‐19 lies the sudden development of cytokine storms, hyper‐inflammatory responses involving the release of pro‐inflammatory cytokines eg, TNF, IL‐6, IL‐1, IL‐8, and MCP‐1 that impair the gas exchange function of the lung and lead in select patients, mostly with underlying comorbidities, to multiorgan failure and death,Abstract                   The primary cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with multiple myeloma MM is an infection Therefore, there is great concern about susceptibility to the outcome of COVID19infected patients with MM This retrospective study describes the baseline characteristics and outcome data of COVID19 infection in 650 patients with plasma cell disorders, collected by the International Myeloma Society to understand the initial challenges faced by myeloma patients during the COVID19 pandemic Analyses were performed for hospitalized MM patients Among hospitalized patients, the median age was 69 years, and nearly all patients 96 had MM Approximately 36 were recently diagnosed 20192020, and 54 of patients were receiving firstline therapy Thirtythree percent of patients have died, with significant geographic variability, ranging from 27 to 57 of hospitalized patients Univariate analysis identified age, International Staging System stage 3 ISS3, highrisk disease, renal disease, suboptimal myeloma control active or progressive disease, and 1 or more comorbidities as risk factors for higher rates of death Neither history of transplant, including within a year of COVID19 diagnosis, nor other antiMM treatments were associated with outcomes Multivariate analysis found that only age, highrisk MM, renal disease, and suboptimal MM control remained independent predictors of adverse outcome with COVID19 infection The management of MM in the era of COVID19 requires careful consideration of patient and diseaserelated factors to decrease the risk of acquiring COVID19 infection, while not compromising disease control through appropriate MM treatment This study provides initial data to develop recommendations for the management of MM patients with COVID19 infection,Patients with coronavirus disease19 COVID19 are at high risk for thrombotic arterial and venous occlusions However, bleeding complications have also been observed in some patients Understanding the balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis will help inform optimal approaches to thrombosis prophylaxis and potential utility of fibrinolytictargeted therapies 118 hospitalized COVID19 patients and 30 healthy controls were included in the study We measured plasma antigen levels of tissuetype plasminogen activator tPA and plasminogen activator inhibitor1 PAI1 and performed spontaneous clotlysis assays We found markedly elevated tPA and PAI1 levels in patients hospitalized with COVID19 Both factors demonstrated strong correlations with neutrophil counts and markers of neutrophil activation High levels of tPA and PAI1 were associated with worse respiratory status High levels of tPA, in particular, were strongly correlated with mortality and a significant enhancement in spontaneous ex vivo clotlysis While both tPA and PAI1 are elevated among COVID19 patients, extremely high levels of tPA enhance spontaneous fibrinolysis and are significantly associated with mortality in some patients These data indicate that fibrinolytic homeostasis in COVID19 is complex with a subset of patients expressing a balance of factors that may favor fibrinolysis Further study of tPA as a biomarker is warranted,,The severity of the coronavirus disease COVID19 is associated with various comorbidities However, no studies have yet demonstrated the potential risk of respiratory failure and mortality in COVID19 patients with preexisting asthma We selected 7272 adult COVID19 patients from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment COVID19 database for this nationwide retrospective cohort study Among these, 686 patients with asthma were assessed by their severities and evaluated by the clinical outcome of COVID19 compared to patients without asthma Of 7272 adult COVID19 patients, 686 with asthma and 6586 without asthma were compared Asthma was not a significant risk factor for respiratory failure or mortality among all COVID19 patients odds ratio ORu2009u2009099, Pu2009u20090997 and ORu2009u2009106, Pu2009u20090759 after adjusting for age, sex, and the Charlson comorbidity score However, a history of acute exacerbation ORu2009u2009263, Pu2009u20090043 was significant risk factors for death among COVID19 patients with asthma Asthma is not a risk factor for poor prognosis of COVID19 However, asthma patients who had any experience of acute exacerbation in the previous year before COVID19 showed higher COVID19related mortality, especially in case of old age and male sex,Many drugs that have been proposed for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 are reported to cause cardiac adverse events, including ventricular arrhythmias In order to properly weigh risks against potential benefits, particularly when decisions must be made quickly, mathematical modeling of both drug disposition and drug action can be useful for predicting patient response and making informed decisions Here, we explored the potential effects on cardiac electrophysiology of four drugs proposed to treat COVID19 lopinavir, ritonavir, chloroquine, and azithromycin, as well as combination therapy involving these drugs Our study combined simulations of pharmacokinetics PKs with quantitative systems pharmacology QSP modeling of ventricular myocytes to predict potential cardiac adverse events caused by these treatments Simulation results predicted that drug combinations can lead to greater cellular action potential prolongation, analogous to QT prolongation, compared with drugs given in isolation The combination effect can result from both PK and pharmacodynamic drug interactions Importantly, simulations of different patient groups predicted that women with preexisting heart disease are especially susceptible to druginduced arrhythmias, compared with diseased men or healthy individuals of either sex Statistical analysis of population simulations revealed the molecular factors that make certain women with heart failure especially susceptible to arrhythmias Overall, the results illustrate how PK and QSP modeling may be combined to more precisely predict cardiac risks of COVID19 therapies,BACKGROUND Critical hypoxia in this COVID19 pandemic results in high mortality and economic loss worldwide Initially, this disease pathophysiology was poorly understood and interpreted as a SARS Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome pneumonia The severe atypical lung CAT scan images alerted all countries, including the poorest, to purchase lacking sophisticated ventilators However, up to 88 of the patients on ventilators lost their lives It was suggested that COVID19 could be similar to a HighAltitude Pulmonary Edema HAPE New observations and pathological findings are gradually clarifying the disease METHODS As highaltitude medicine and hypoxia physiology specialists working and living in the highlands for over 50 years, we perform a perspective analysis of hypoxic diseases treated at high altitudes and compare them to Covid19 Oxygen transport physiology, SARSCov2 characteristics, and its transmission, lung imaging in COVID19, and HAPE, as well as the causes of clinical signs and symptoms, are discussed RESULTS Highaltitude oxygen transport physiology has been systematically ignored COVID19 signs and symptoms indicate a progressive and irreversible failure in the oxygen transport system, secondary to pneumolysis produced by SARSCov2s alveolarcapillary membrane attack HAPEs pulmonary compromise is treatable and reversible COVID19 is associated with several diseases, with different individual outcomes, in different countries, and at different altitudes CONCLUSIONS The pathophysiology of Highaltitude illnesses can help explain COVID19 pathophysiology, severity, and management Early diagnosis and use of EPO, acetylsalicylicacid, and other antiinflammatories, oxygen therapy, antitussives, antibiotics, and the use of Earth opencircuit astronautresembling suits to return to daily activities, should all be considered Ventilator use can be counterproductive Immunity development is the only feasible longterm survival tool,Background Risk of aerosolisation of SARSCoV2 directly informs organisation of acute healthcare and PPE guidance Continuous positive airways pressure CPAP and highflow nasal oxygen HFNO are widely used modes of oxygen delivery and respiratory support for patients with severe COVID19, with both considered as high risk aerosol generating procedures However, there are limited high quality experimental data characterising aerosolisation during oxygen delivery and respiratory support   Methods Healthy volunteers were recruited to breathe, speak, and cough in ultraclean, laminar flow theatres followed by using oxygen and respiratory support systems Aerosol emission was measured using two discrete methodologies, simultaneously Hospitalised patients with COVID19 were also recruited and had aerosol emissions measured during breathing, speaking, and coughing   Findings In healthy volunteers n  25 subjects 531 measures, CPAP with exhalation port filter produced less aerosols than breathing, speaking and coughing even with large 50Lm facemask leaks HFNO did emit aerosols, but the majority of these particles were generated from the HFNO machine, not the patient HFNOgenerated particles were small 1μm, passing from the machine through the patient and to the detector without coalescence with respiratory aerosol, thereby unlikely to carry viral particles Coughing was associated with the highest aerosol emissions with a peak concentration at least 10 times greater the mean concentration generated from speaking or breathing Hospitalised patients with COVID19 n  8 subjects 56 measures had similar size distributions to healthy volunteers   Interpretation In healthy volunteers, CPAP is associated with less aerosol emission than breathing, speaking or coughing Aerosol emission from the respiratory tract does not appear to be increased by HFNO Although direct comparisons are complex, cough appears to generate significant aerosols in a size range compatible with airborne transmission of SARSCoV2 As a consequence, the risk of SARSCoV2 aerosolisation is likely to be high in all areas where patients with Covid19 are coughing Guidance on personal protective equipment policy should reflect these updated risks   Funding NIHRUKRI Rapid COVID call COV003, Wellcome Trust GW4CAT Doctoral Training Scheme FH, MRC CARP FellowshipJD, MRT0051141 Natural Environment Research Council grant BB, NEP0184591   Research in context  Evidence before this study PubMed was searched from inception until 10121 using the terms aerosol, and variations of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation and highflow nasal oxygen therapy Studies were included if they measured aerosol generated from volunteers or patients receiving noninvasive positive pressure ventilation NIV or high flow nasal oxygen therapy HFNO, or provided experimental evidence on a simulated human setting One study was identified Gaeckle et al, 2020 which measured aerosol emission with one methodology APS but was limited by high background concentration of aerosol and a low number of participants n  10   Added value of this study This study used multiple methodologies to measure aerosol emission from the respiratory tract before and during CPAP and highflow nasal oxygen, in an ultraclean, laminar flow theatre with nearzero background aerosol and recruited patients with COVID19 to ensure similar aerosol distributions We conclude that there is negligible aerosol generation with CPAP, that aerosol emission from HFNO is from the machine and not the patient, coughing emits aerosols consistent with airborne transmission of SARS CoV2 and that healthy volunteers are a reasonable proxy for COVID19 patients   Implications of all the available evidence CPAP and HFNO should not be considered high risk aerosol generating procedures, based on our study and that of Gaeckle et al Recorded aerosol emission from HFNO stems from the machine Cough remains a significant aerosol risk PPE guidance should be updated to ensure medical staff are protected with appropriate PPE in situations when patients with suspected or proven COVID19 are likely to cough,Comorbidities in rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases RMDs not only increase morbidity and mortality but also confound disease activity, limit drug usage and increase chances of severe infections or drugassociated adverse effects Most RMDs lead to accelerated atherosclerosis and variable manifestations of the metabolic syndrome Literature on COVID19 in patients with RMDs, and the effects of various comorbidities on COVID19 was reviewed The initial data of COVID19 infections in RMDs have not shown an increased risk for severe disease or the use of different immunosuppression However, there are some emerging data that patients with RMDs and comorbidities may fare worse Various metaanalyses have reiterated that preexisting hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, lung disease or obesity predispose to increased COVID19 mortality All these comorbidities are commonly encountered in the various RMDs Presence of comorbidities in RMDs pose a greater risk than the RMDs themselves A risk score based on comorbidities in RMDs should be developed to predict severe COVID19 and death Additionally, there should be active management of such comorbidities to mitigate these risks The pandemic must draw our attention towards, and not away from, comorbidities,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection is capable of affecting several organs Direct viral toxicity, proinflammatory and prothrombotic induction, endothelial damage, immune imbalance, and dysregulation of the reninangiotensinaldosterone system are the mechanisms underlying the viral potential of multiple organ damage The impairment of four organs stands out among severe patients lung, heart, kidney, and endothelium The nuclear medicine field holds accurate and safe exam techniques, such as positron emission tomographycomputed tomography and scintigraphy, that allow the anatomophysiological study of the majority of human organ systems By choosing the most appropriate method and radiopharmaceutical, analyzing the presence of inflammation, fibrosis, changes in perfusion, and function of desired organs is possible Therefore, its use in the monitoring of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 becomes relevant, especially for monitoring sequelae In this review, we discuss the use of Nuclear Medicine in the detection, monitoring, and therapeutic evaluation of pulmonary and extrapulmonary sequelae by coronavirus disease 2019,The primary cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with multiple myeloma MM is an infection Therefore, there is great concern about susceptibility to the outcome of COVID19infected patients with MM This retrospective study describes the baseline characteristics and outcome data of COVID19 infection in 650 patients with plasma cell disorders, collected by the International Myeloma Society to

while not compromising disease control through appropriate MM treatment This study provides initial data to develop recommendations for the management of MM patients with COVID19 infection,,BACKGROUND SARSCoV2 infection COVID19 disease can induce systemic vascular involvement contributing to morbidity and mortality SARSCoV2 targets epithelial and endothelial cells through the ACE2 receptor The anatomical involvement of the coronary tree is not explored yet METHODS Cardiac autopsy tissue of the entire coronary tree main coronary arteries, epicardial arteriolesvenules, epicardial capillaries and epicardial nerves were analyzed in COVID19 patients nxa0xa06 All anatomical regions were immunohistochemically tested for ACE2, TMPRSS2, CD147, CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD68 and IL6 COVID19 negative patients with cardiovascular disease nxa0xa03 and influenza A nxa0xa06 served as controls FINDINGS COVID19 positive patients showed strong ACE2  TMPRSS2 expression in capillaries and less in arteriolesvenules The main coronary arteries were virtually devoid of ACE2 receptor and had only mild intimal inflammation Epicardial capillaries had a prominent lymphomonocytic endotheliitis, which was less pronounced in arteriolesvenules The lymphocyticmonocytic infiltrate strongly expressed CD4, CD45, CD68 Periepicardial nerves had strong ACE2 expression and lymphomonocytic inflammation COVID19 negative patients showed minimal vascular ACE2 expression and lacked endotheliitis or inflammatory reaction INTERPRETATION ACE2  TMPRSS2 expression and lymphomonocytic inflammation in COVID19 disease increases crescentically towards the small vessels suggesting that COVID19induced endotheliitis is a small vessel vasculitis not involving the main coronaries The inflammatory neuropathy of epicardial nerves in COVID19 disease provides further evidence of an angio and neurotrophic affinity of SARSCOV2 and might potentially contribute to the understanding of the high prevalence of cardiac complications such as myocardial injury and arrhythmias in COVID19 FUNDING No external funding was necessary for this study,BACKGROUND u2003Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 increases thrombosis in hospitalized patients prompting adoption of different thromboprophylaxis strategies Safety and efficacy of escalateddose pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis are not established OBJECTIVES u2003To determine the pooled incidence of thrombosisbleeding in hospitalized patients with COVID19 for standarddose, intermediatedose, therapeutic anticoagulation, and no pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis METHODS u2003MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched up to August 29, 2020 for studies reporting pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis and thrombosis or bleeding Pooled event rates were calculated using a randomeffects model RESULTS u2003Thirtyfive observational studies were included The pooled incidence rates of total venous thromboembolism Nu2009u20094,685 were no prophylaxis 419

bleeding event rates Nu2009u20096,393 were nonsignificantly higher in therapeuticdose anticoagulants compared with standarddose prophylaxis, 63 vs 17, pu2009u20090083 CONCLUSION u2003Thrombosis rates were lower in hospitalized COVID19 patients who received pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis Thrombosis and bleeding rates for patients receiving intermediatedose thromboprophylaxis or therapeutic anticoagulation were similar to those who received standarddose pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis,Among the pathways and mediators that may be dysregulated in COVID19 infection, there are proinflammatory cytokines, lymphocyte apoptosis, and the coagulation cascade Venous and arterial thromboembolisms also are frequent in COVID19 patients with the increased risk of some lifethreatening complications such as pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke In this regard, overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL6, IL1β, and TNFα induce cytokine storms, increase the risk of clot formation, platelet activation, and multiorgan failure that may eventually lead to death among these patients Surface S protein of SARSCoV2 binds to its target transmembrane receptor, named as angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ACE2, on various cells such as lymphocyte, alveolar cells, monocytesmacrophages, and platelets Notably, the activation of the coagulation cascade occurs through tissue factor TFFVIIainitiated hemostasis Accordingly, TF plays the major role in the activation of coagulation system during viral infection In viral infections, the related coagulopathy multiple factors such as inflammatory cytokines and viral specific TLRs are involved, which consequently induce TF expression aberrantly SARSCOV2 may directly infect monocytes macrophages In addition, TF expressionrelease from these cells may play a critical role in the development of COVID19 coagulopathy In this regard, the use of TF VIIa complex inhibitor may reduce the cytokine storm and mortality among COVID19 patients,OBJECTIVE To describe the clinical manifestations and severity of children and adolescents affected by COVID19 treated at Sabará Hospital Infantil METHODS This is a crosssectional, retrospective, and observational study All cases of COVID19 confirmed by RTqPCR of patients seen at the hospital emergency room, firstaid room, and ICU were analyzed The severity of the cases was classified according to the Chinese Consensus RESULTS Among the 115 children included, a predominance of boys 57 was verified, and the median age was two years A total of 22 children were hospitalized, 12 in the ICU Of the total, 26 had comorbidities with a predominance of asthma 13 Fever, cough, and nasal discharge were the most frequent symptoms Respiratory symptoms were reported by 58 of children and gastrointestinal symptoms, by 34 Three children were asymptomatic, 81 70 had upper airway symptoms, 15 13 had mild pneumonia, and 16 14 had severe pneumonia Hospitalized children were younger than nonhospitalized children 7 months vs 36 months In hospitalized patients, a higher frequency of irritability, dyspnea, drowsiness, respiratory distress, low oxygen saturation, and hepatomegaly was observed Chest radiography was performed in 69 children with 45 of abnormal exams No child required mechanical ventilation and there were no deaths CONCLUSIONS Most of children and adolescents affected by COVID19 had mild upper airway symptoms Clinical manifestations of COVID19 were more severe among younger children who exhibited gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms more frequently,AIMS Healthcare services worldwide have been significantly impacted by the COVID19 pandemic Recent reports have shown a decline in hospitalization for emergency cardiac conditions The impact of the COVID19 pandemic on hospitalization and particularly mortality due to acute heart failure has not been thoroughly described METHODS AND RESULTS In this singlecentre observational study, we examined referrals to the acute heart failure team over a period of 16xa0weeks 7 January to 27 April 2020 spanning the ongoing COVID19 pandemic 283 patients referred to our acute heart failure services over the study period were included on the basis of typical symptoms, raised BNP, and echocardiogram There was a substantial but statistically nonsignificant drop in referrals with 164 referred in the 8xa0weeks before the first UK death due to COVID19 on 2 March 2020 BC, compared with 119 referred after AC in the subsequent 8xa0weeks, representing a 27 reduction overall Pxa0xa0006 The 30xa0day case fatality rate was increased from 11 in the BC group compared with 21 in the AC group risk ratioxa0xa019, 95 confidence interval 10933 Age, gender, length of stay, left ventricular ejection fraction, and Nterminal probrain natriuretic peptide were similar between the groups Admission creatinine, age, and AC cohort status were found to be univariable predictors of mortality On multivariate Cox regression analysis, only age hazard ratio 104, Pxa0xa0003 and AC cohort status hazard ratio 21, Pxa0xa00017 remained significant predictors of mortality On sensitivity analysis, this increased mortality was driven by COVID19 positive status CONCLUSIONS There was a reduction in referral of patients with acute heart failure with significant increase in mortality in the 8xa0weeks following the first reported UK death due to COVID19 The observation of increased mortality does not appear related to a change in population in terms of demographics, left ventricular ejection fraction, or Nterminal probrain natriuretic peptide The observed increased mortality appears to be related to the coexistence of COVID19 infection with acute heart failure The study highlights the need for widespread preventative and shielding measures particularly in this group of patients especially in the light of the second wave Longer followup with inclusion of data from other centres and community heart failure services will be needed,Lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD and asthma are inflammatory diseases that have risen worldwide, posing a major public health issue, encompassing not only physical and psychological morbidity and mortality, but also incurring significant societal costs The leading cause of death worldwide by cancer is that of the lung, which, in large part, is a result of the disease often not being detected until a late stage Although COPD and asthma are conditions with considerably lower mortality, they are extremely distressful to people and involve high healthcare overheads Moreover, for these diseases, diagnostic methods are not only costly but are also invasive, thereby adding to peoples stress It has been appreciated for many decades that the analysis of trace volatile organic compounds VOCs in exhaled breath could potentially provide cheaper, rapid, and noninvasive screening procedures to diagnose and monitor the above diseases of the lung However, after decades of research associated with breath biomarker discovery, no breath VOC tests are clinically available Reasons for this include the little consensus as to which breath volatiles or pattern of volatiles can be used to discriminate people with lung diseases, and our limited understanding of the biological origin of the identified VOCs Lung disease diagnosis using breath VOCs is challenging Nevertheless, the numerous studies of breath volatiles and lung disease provide guidance as to what volatiles need further investigation for use in differential diagnosis, highlight the urgent need for noninvasive clinical breath tests, illustrate the way forward for future studies, and provide significant guidance to achieve the goal of developing noninvasive diagnostic tests for lung disease This review provides an overview of these issues from evaluating key studies that have been undertaken in the years 20102019, in order to present objective and comprehensive updated information that presents the progress that has been made in this field The potential of this approach is highlighted, while strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats are discussed This review will be of interest to chemists, biologists, medical doctors and researchers involved in the development of analytical instruments for breath diagnosis,INTRODUCTION In March and April 2020 of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, site clinical practice guidelines were implemented for prone positioning of patients with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 in hypoxic respiratory distress who are awake, alert, and spontaneously breathing The purpose of this pandemic disaster practice improvement project was to measure changes in pulse oximetry associated with prone positioning of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 infection in adult acute respiratory distress or adult respiratory distress syndrome, who are awake, alert, spontaneously breathing, and nonintubated METHODS A retrospective chart review of patients who were coronavirus disease 2019 positive in the emergency department from March 30, 2020 to April 30, 2020 was conducted for patients with a room air pulse oximetry 90 and a preprone position pulse oximetry 94 who tolerated prone positioning for at least 30xa0minutes The primary outcome was the change in pulse oximetry associated with prone positioning, measured on room air, with supplemental oxygen, and approximately 30xa0minutes after initiating prone positioning Median and mean differences were compared with the Wilcoxon signedrank test and paired ttest RESULTS Of the 440 patients with coronavirus disease 2019, 31 met inclusion criteria Median pulse oximetry increased as 83 interquartile range, 7586 on room air, 90 interquartile range, 8993 with supplemental oxygen, and 96 interquartile range, 9498 with prone positioning z  448, P  001 A total of 45 nxa0 14 were intubated during their hospital stay, and 26 nxa0 8 of the included patients died DISCUSSION In patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who are awake, alert, and spontaneously breathing, an initially low pulse oximetry reading improved with prone positioning Future studies are needed to determine the association of prone positioning with subsequent endotracheal intubation and mortality,Background The global crisis situation caused by SARSCoV2 has created an explosive demand for ventilators, which cannot be met even in developed countries Designing a simple and inexpensive device with the ability to increase the number of patients that can be connected to existing ventilators would have a major impact on the number of lives that could be saved We conducted a study to determine whether two pigs with significant differences in size and weight could be ventilated simultaneously using a single ventilator connected to a new medical device called DuplicARⓇ Methods Six pigs median weight 12u2009kg, range 925u2009kg were connected in pairs to a single ventilator using the new device for 6 hours Both the ventilator and the device were manipulated throughout the experiment according to the needs of each animal Tidal volume and positive endexpiratory pressure were individually controlled with the device Primary and secondary outcome variables were defined to assess ventilation and hemodynamics in all animals throughout the experiment Results Median difference in weight between the animals of each pair was 67 range 11108 All animals could be successfully oxygenated and ventilated for 6 hours through manipulation of the ventilator and the DuplicARⓇ device, despite significant discrepancies in body size and weight Mean PaCO2 in arterial blood was 421u2009u200944u2009mmHg, mean PaO2 was 1628u2009u2009468u2009mmHg, and mean oxygen saturation was 98u2009u200913 Endtidal CO2 values showed no statistically significant difference among subjects of each pair Mean difference in arterial PaCO2 measured at the same time in both animals of each pair was 48u2009u20093u2009mmHg, reflecting the ability of the device to ventilate each animal according to its particular requirements Independent management of PEEP was achieved by manipulation of the device controllers Conclusion It is possible to ventilate two lunghealthy animals with a single ventilator according to each ones needs through manipulation of both the ventilator and the DuplicARⓇ device This gives this device the potential to expand local ventilators surge capacity during disasters or pandemics until emergency supplies can be delivered from central stockpiles,It is widely recognized that hypertension is one of the major risk factor for disease severity and mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 However, type 2 diabetes mellitus T2DM and hypertension are frequent comorbid conditions, complicating the assessment of hypertensions individual contribution to the risk The aims of this study were to evaluate the contributions of hypertension alone, T2DM alone, or their combination to the risk of death, acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDSrespiratory failure, and severe COVID19 infection Additionally, we assessed risks associated with elevated blood pressure and fasting blood glucose on the same three clinical outcomes Multivariate logistic models were used for these analyses Among the 3400 patients, 3327979 survived and 7321 died Compared to patients having neither hypertension nor T2DM nxa0xa01392, the risk of mortality was significantly higher in patients with T2DM alone nxa0xa0226, OR 526 95 CI 2391158 or with T2DM in combination with hypertension nxa0xa0507, OR 302, 95 CI 148615 Similarly, T2DM was a risk factor for development of ARDSrespiratory failure and severe infection Hypertension alone nxa0xa01275 only conferred additional risk for the development of severe infection OR 122 95 CI 100151 In conclusion, neither hypertension nor elevated blood pressure was independent risk factors for death or ARDSrespiratory failure but hypertension marginally increased the risk of severe COVID19 infection The risk associated with hypertension is accentuated through its confounding effect on T2DM,,BACKGROUND The coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic has adversely affected diagnosis and treatment of noncommunicable diseases Its effects on delivery of diagnostic care for cardiovascular disease, which remains the leading cause of death worldwide, have not been quantified OBJECTIVES The study sought to assess COVID19s impact on global cardiovascular diagnostic procedural volumes and safety practices METHODS The International Atomic Energy Agency conducted a worldwide survey assessing alterations in cardiovascular procedure volumes and safety practices resulting from COVID19 Noninvasive and invasive cardiac testing volumes were obtained from participating sites for March and April 2020 and compared with those from March 2019 Availability of personal protective equipment and pandemicrelated testing practice changes were ascertained RESULTS Surveys were submitted from 909 inpatient and outpatient centers performing cardiac diagnostic procedures, in 108 countries Procedure volumes decreased 42 from March 2019 to March 2020, and 64 from March 2019 to April 2020xa0Transthoracic echocardiography decreased by 59, transesophageal echocardiography 76, and stress tests 78, which varied between stress modalities Coronary angiography invasive or computed tomography decreased 55 p,Both lung adenocarcinoma and coronavirus disease 2019 would cause pulmonary inflammation Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2, the functional receptor of SARSCoV2, also plays a key role in lung adenocarcinoma To study the risk of SARSCoV2 infection in lung adenocarcinoma patients, mRNA and microRNA profiles were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus followed by bioinformatics analysis A network which regards angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 as the center was structured In addition, via immunological analysis to explore the essential mechanism of SARSCoV2 susceptibility in lung adenocarcinoma Compared with normal tissue, angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 was increased in lung adenocarcinoma patients Furthermore, a total of 7 correlated differently expressed mRNAs ACE2, CXCL9, MMP12, IL6, AZU1, FCN3, HYAL1 and IRAK3 and 5 correlated differently expressed microRNAs miR125b5p, miR95p, miR130b5p, miR3813p and miR421 were screened Interestingly, the most frequent tolllike receptor signaling pathway was enriched by mRNA interlukin 6 and miRNA miR125b5p sets simultaneously In conclusion, it was assumed that miR125b5pACE2IL6 axis could alter the risk of SARSCoV2 infection in lung adenocarcinoma patients,BACKGROUND Although the direct toll of COVID19 in the United States has been substantial, concerns have also arisen about the indirect effects of the pandemic Hospitalizations for acute cardiovascular conditions have declined, raising concern that patients may be avoiding hospitals because of fear of contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 SARSCoV2 Other factors, including strain on health care systems, may also have had an indirect toll OBJECTIVES This investigation aimed to evaluate whether populationlevel deaths due to cardiovascular causes increased during the COVID19 pandemic METHODS The authors conducted an observational cohort study using data from the National Center for Health Statistics to evaluate the rate of deaths due to cardiovascular causes after the onset of the pandemic in the United States, from March 18, 2020, to June 2, 2020, relative to the period immediately preceding the pandemic January 1, 2020 to March 17, 2020 Changes in deaths were compared with the same periods in the previous year RESULTS There were 397,042 cardiovascular deaths from January 1, 2020, to June 2, 2020 Deaths caused by ischemic heart disease increased nationally after the onset of the pandemic in 2020, compared with changes over the same period in 2019 ratio of the relative change in deaths per 100,000 in 2020 vs 2019 111, 95 confidence interval 104 to 118 An increase was also observed for deaths caused by hypertensive disease 117, 95 confidence interval 109 to 126, but not for heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, or other diseases of the circulatory system New York City experienced a large relative increase in deaths caused by ischemic heart disease 239, 95 confidence interval 139 to 409 and hypertensive diseases 264, 95 confidence interval 152 to 456 during the pandemic More modest increases in deaths caused by these conditions occurred in the remainder of New York State, New Jersey, Michigan, and Illinois but not in Massachusetts or Louisiana CONCLUSIONS There was an increase in deaths caused by ischemic heart disease and hypertensive diseases in some regions of the United States during the initial phase of the COVID19 pandemic These findings suggest that the pandemic may have had an indirect toll on patients with cardiovascular disease,This crosssectional study compares trends in outofhospital cardiac arrests and fatalities in the Detroit area during the COVID19 pandemic with yearearlier events for the same period,Objective To investigate if machine learning algorithms can predict whether a lung nodule is benign, adenocarcinoma, or its preinvasive subtype from Computed Tomography CT images alone Methods A dataset of chest CT scans containing lung nodules was collected with their pathologic diagnosis from several sources The dataset was split randomly into training 70, internal validation 15, and independent test sets 15 at the patient level Two machine learning algorithms were developed, trained, and validated The first used the support vector machine SVM model, the second used deep learning technology, namely a convolutional neural network CNN Receiveroperating characteristic ROC analysis was used to evaluate the performance of the classification on the test dataset Results The SVM  CNN based models classified nodules into six categories resulting in an area under the curve AUC of 059  065 when differentiating Atypical Adenomatous Hyperplasia AAH vs Adenocarcinoma in Situ AIS, 087  086 with Minimally Invasive Adenocarcinoma MIA vs Invasive Adenocarcinoma IA, 076  072 AAHAIS vs MIA, 089  087 AAHAIS vs MIAIA and 093 092 AAHAISMIA vs IA Classifying Benign vs AAHAISMIA vs IA resulted in a microaverage AUC of 093094 for the SVMCNN models, respectively The CNNbased methods had higher sensitivities than the SVMbased methods but lower specificities and accuracies Conclusion The machine learning algorithms demonstrated reasonable performance in differentiating benign vs preinvasive vs invasive adenocarcinoma from CT images alone However, the prediction accuracy varies across its subtypes This holds the potential for improved diagnostic capabilities with less invasive means,COVID19 disease is a systemic inflammatory viral reaction starting with the viral phase followed by the inflammatory phase The first phase is rather mild and asymptomatic with only a small subset of infected patients turning into the inflammatory phase with high mortality Patients with preexisting cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular risk factors pose a considerably higher risk to develop severe or lethal COVID19 disease course COVID19 affects not only the epithelial cells of the lung parenchyma via ACE2, but also endothelial cells across the whole body thus leading to generalized endothelial damage and inflammation, socalled endotheliitis The histological morphology of endotheliitis comprises the accumulation of lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages beneath the endothelial cells and within the perivascular spaces Endothelial cells play an important role in the regulation of vascular tone and the maintenance of vascular homeostasis Endotheliitis thus can shift the vascular equilibrium towards more pronounced vasoconstriction with subsequent organ ischemia, inflammation with associated tissue edema and a procoagulant state Patients with preexisting endothelial dysfunction male sex, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and established cardiovascular disease are particularly vulnerable and have adverse outcomes in COVID19 This is a rationale for approaches to stabilize the endothelium Most of these findings have been established from autopsies since the outbreak of the pandemic,OBJECTIVE This study aimed to develop and externally validate a COVID19 mortality risk prediction algorithm DESIGN Retrospective cohort study SETTING Five designated tertiary hospitals for COVID19 in Hubei province, China PARTICIPANTS We routinely collected medical data of 1364 confirmed adult patients with COVID19 between 8 January and 19 March 2020 Among them, 1088 patients from two designated hospitals in Wuhan were used to develop the prognostic model, and 276 patients from three hospitals outside Wuhan were used for external validation All patients were followed up for a maximal of 60 days after the diagnosis of COVID19 METHODS The model discrimination was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve AUC and Somers D test, and calibration was examined by the calibration plot Decision curve analysis was conducted MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was allcause mortality within 60 days after the diagnosis of COVID19 RESULTS The full model included seven predictors of age, respiratory failure, white cell count, lymphocytes, platelets, Ddimer and lactate dehydrogenase The simple model contained five indicators of age, respiratory failure, coronary heart disease, renal failure and heart failure After crossvalidation, the AUC statistics based on derivation cohort were 096 95 CI, 096 to 097 for the full model and 092 95 CI, 089 to 095 for the simple model The AUC statistics based on the external validation cohort were 097 95 CI, 096 to 098 for the full model and 088 95 CI, 080 to 096 for the simple model Good calibration accuracy of these two models was found in the derivation and validation cohort CONCLUSION The prediction models showed good model performance in identifying patients with COVID19 with a high risk of death in 60 days It may be useful for acute risk classification WEB CALCULATOR We provided a freely accessible web calculator httpswwwwhuyijiacom,BACKGROUND There is a paucity of information on coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 outcomes in asthmatics OBJECTIVE To identify risk factors associated with admission and subsequent mortality among COVID19infected asthmatics METHODS Adults at our institution with a positive polymerase chain reaction for COVID19 between March 14 and April 27, 2020, were retrospectively identified Comorbidities, laboratory results, and mortality rates during hospitalization were recorded RESULTS In total, 737 of 951 775 asthma patients with COVID19 were seen in the emergency department ED, and 788 of these ED patients 581 of 737 were admitted Individuals with previously measured mean absolute eosinophil counts AEC 150 cellsμL were less likely to be admitted odds ratio ORxa0 046, 95 confidence interval CI 021098, Pxa0 04, whereas concomitant heart failure CHF, chronic kidney disease CKD, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD were risk factors for admission Hospitalized patients with asthma with peak hospitalmeasured AEC 150 cellsμL nxa0 104 were less likely to die compared with those whose AEC remained 150 cellsμL nxa0 213 mortality rate 96 vs 258 ORxa0 0006, 95 CI 00001064, Pxa0 03 This group had also higher preadmission mean AEC 237xa0xa0181xa0vs 163  147 cellsμL, Pxa0 001, ORxa0 2012, 95 CI 27314,816 The mortality rate in patients with asthma alone no associated CHF, CKD, COPD, diabetes, or hypertension was similar to that of patients without asthma or any of these comorbidities CONCLUSIONS In asthmatics, preexisting eosinophilia AEC 150 cellsμL was protective from COVID19associated admission, and development of eosinophilia AEC 150 cellsμL during hospitalization was associated with decreased mortality Preadmission AEC influenced the AEC trend during hospitalization Having a Th2asthma phenotype might be an important predictor for reduced COVID19 morbidity and mortality that should be further explored in prospective andxa0mechanistic studies,After initially hypothesizing a positive relationship between use of reninangiotensinaldosterone system inhibitors and risk of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19, more recent evidence suggests negative associations We examined whether COVID19 risk differs according to antihypertensive drug class in patients treated by ACE angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers ARBs compared with calcium channel blockers CCBs Three exclusive cohorts of prevalent ACE inhibitors, ARB and CCB users, aged 18 to 80 years, from the French National Health Insurance databases were followed from February 15, 2020 to June 7, 2020 We excluded patients with a history of diabetes, known cardiovascular disease, chronic renal failure, or chronic respiratory disease during the previous 5 years, to only consider patients treated for uncomplicated hypertension and to limit indication bias The primary end point was time to hospitalization for COVID19 The secondary end point was time to intubationdeath during a hospital stay for COVID19 In a population of almost 2 million hypertensive patients ACE inhibitors 566u2009023 ARB 958u2009227 CCB 358u2009306 followed for 16 weeks, 2338 were hospitalized and 526 died or were intubated for COVID19 ACE inhibitors and ARBs were associated with a lower risk of COVID19 hospitalization compared with CCBs hazard ratio, 074 95 CI, 065083 and 084 076093, respectively and a lower risk of intubationdeath Risks were slightly lower for ACE inhibitor users than for ARB users This large observational study may suggest a lower COVID19 risk in hypertensive patients treated over a long period with ACE inhibitors or ARBs compared with CCBs These results, if confirmed, tend to contradict previous hypotheses and raise new hypotheses,The severity of COVID19 lung disease is higher in the elderly and people with preexisting comorbidities People who were born preterm may be at greater risk for COVID19 because their early exposure to oxygen hyperoxia at birth increases the severity of respiratory viral infections Hyperoxia at birth increases the severity of influenza A virus infections in adult mice by reducing the number of alveolar epithelial type 2 AT2 cells Since AT2 cells express the SARSCoV2 receptors angiotensin converting enzyme ACE2 and transmembrane proteaseserine subfamily member 2 TMPRSS2, their expression should decline as AT2 cells are depleted by hyperoxia Instead, ACE2 was detected in airway Club cells and endothelial cells at birth, and then AT2 cells at one year of age Neonatal hyperoxia stimulated expression of ACE2 in Club cells and in AT2 cells by 2xa0months of age It also stimulated expression of TMPRSS2 in the lung Increased expression of SARSCoV2 receptors was blocked by mitoTEMPO, a mitochondrial superoxide scavenger that reduced oxidative stress and DNA damage seen in oxygenexposed mice Our finding that hyperoxia enhances the agedependent expression of SARSCoV2 receptors in mice helps explain why COVID19 lung disease is greater in the elderly and people with preexisting comorbidities,BackgroundPatients with severe asthma may have a greater risk of dying from COVID19 disease Angiotensin converting enzyme2 ACE2 and the enzyme proteases, transmembrane protease serine 2 TMPRSS2 and FURIN, are needed for viral attachment and invasion into host cellsMethodsWe examined microarray mRNA expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and FURIN in sputum, bronchial brushing and bronchial biopsies of the European UBIOPRED cohort Clinical parameters and molecular phenotypes, including asthma severity, sputum inflammatory cells, lung functions, oral corticosteroid OCS use, and transcriptomicassociated clusters, were examined in relation to gene expression levelsResultsACE2 levels were significantly increased in sputum of severe asthma compared to mildmoderate asthma In multivariate analyses, sputum ACE2 levels were positively associated with OCS use and male gender Sputum FURIN levels were significantly related to neutrophils  and the presence of severe asthma In bronchial brushing samples, TMPRSS2 levels were positively associated with male gender and body mass index, whereas FURIN levels with male gender and blood neutrophils In bronchial biopsies, TMPRSS2 levels were positively related to blood neutrophils The neutrophilic molecular phenotype characterised by high inflammasome activation expressed significantly higher FURIN levels in sputum than the eosinophilic Type 2high or the paucigranulocytic oxidative phosphorylation phenotypesConclusionLevels of ACE2 and FURIN may differ by clinical or molecular phenotypes of asthma Sputum FURIN expression levels were strongly associated with neutrophilic inflammation and with inflammasome activation This might indicate the potential for a greater morbidity and mortality outcome from SARSCoV2 infection in neutrophilic severe asthma,,,Hyperuricemia and gout have been linked to an increased risk for cardiovascular CV disease, stroke, hypertension, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease, possibly through a proinflammatory milieu However, not all the drugs used in gout treatment improve CV outcomes colchicine has shown improved CV outcomes in patients with recent myocardial infarction and stable coronary artery disease independent of lipidlowering effects There is resurging interest in colchicine following publication of the COLCOT, LoDoCo, LoDoCo2, LoDoCoMI trials,xa0and COLCORONA trial which will shed light on itsxa0utility in COVID19 Our aim is to review the CV use of colchicine beyond pericardial diseases, as well as CV outcomes of the available gout therapies, including allopurinol and febuxostat The CARES trial and its surrounding controversies, which lead to the US FDA black box warning on febuxostat, in addition to the recent FAST trial which contradicts this and finds febuxostat to be noninferior,xa0are discussed in this paper,Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is an emerging infectious disease Bilateral pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and coagulation activation are key features of severe COVID19 Fibrinogen and Ddimer levels are typically increased The risk for venous thromboembolism is markedly increased, especially in patients in the intensive care unit despite prophylactic dose anticoagulation Pulmonary microvascular thrombosis has also been described and the risk for arterial thrombotic diseases also appears to be increased while bleeding is less common than thrombosis, but it can occur Evaluation for venous thromboembolism may be challenging because symptoms of pulmonary embolism overlap with COVID19, and imaging studies may not be feasible in all cases The threshold for evaluation or diagnosis of thromboembolism should be low given the high frequency of these events Management and treatment are new challenges due to the paucity of highquality evidence regarding efficacy and safety of different approaches to prevent or treat thromboembolic complications of the disease All inpatients should receive thromboprophylaxis unless contraindicated Some institutional protocols provide more aggressive anticoagulation with intermediate or even therapeutic dose anticoagulation for COVID19 patients admitted to ICU Therapeutic dose anticoagulation is always appropriate to treat deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, unless contraindicated This article reviews evaluation and management of coagulation abnormalities in individuals with COVID19,We present the case of a 39yearold man with epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting The patient scored 4 in the Visual Triage Checklist of acute respiratory symptoms a COVID19 swab was taken Prompt review of the peripheral blood smear showed evidence of microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia Because the patient had a picture of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, plasma exchange and corticosteroids were started immediately After 3u2009days, he developed severe ischaemic stroke and his swabs came back positive for COVID19 by reverse transcription PCR Therefore, triple therapy was started lopinavirritonavir, ribavirin and interferon beta1b White blood cell count reached 50×109L normal range, 4511×109L, mainly neutrophils All the workup for autoimmune diseases was negative The patient showed delayed improvement in lactate dehydrogenase, haemoglobin and platelet count until we increased the volume of plasma exchange and subsided the inflammatory response of COVID19 After that, the patient showed an excellent recovery,BACKGROUND The presence of any underlying heart condition could influence outcomes during the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 METHODS The registry HOPECOVID19 Health Outcome Predictive Evaluation for COVID19, NCT04334291 is an international ambispective study, enrolling COVID19 patients discharged from hospital, dead or alive RESULTS HOPE enrolled 2798 patients from 35 centers in 7 countries Median age was 67 years IQR 530780, and most were male 595 A relevant heart disease was present in 682 24 cases These were older, more frequently male, with higher overall burden of cardiovascular risk factors hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking habit, obesity and other comorbidities such renal failure, lung, cerebrovascular disease and oncologic antecedents p  001, for all The heart cohort received more corticoids 289 vs 204, p  0001, antibiotics, but less hydroxychloroquine, antivirals or tocilizumab Considering the epidemiologic profile, a previous heart condition was independently related with shortterm mortality in the COX multivariate analysis 162 95 CI 129203 p  0001 Moreover, heart patients needed more respiratory, circulatory support, and presented more inhospital events, such heart failure, renal failure, respiratory insufficiency, sepsis, SIRS and clinically relevant bleedings all, p  0001, and mortality 397 vs 155 p  0001 CONCLUSIONS An underlying heart disease is an adverse prognostic factor for patients suffering COVID19 Its presence could be related with different clinical drug management and would benefit from maintaining treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers during inhospital stay Trial Numbers NCT04334291 EUPAS34399,Disordered coagulation, endothelial dysfunction, dehydration and immobility contribute to a substantially elevated risk of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism PE and systemic thrombosis in coronavirus disease 2019 Covid19 We evaluated the prevalence of pulmonary thrombosis and reported RV right ventricular dilatationdysfunction associated with Covid19 in a tertiary referral Covid19 centre Of 370 patients, positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2xa0SARSCoV2, 39 patients mean age 623u2009u200915xa0years, 56 male underwent computed tomography pulmonary angiography CTPA, due to increasing oxygen requirements or refractory hypoxia, not improving on oxygen, very elevated Ddimer or tachycardia disproportionate to clinical condition Thrombosis in the pulmonary vasculature was found in 18 462 patients However, pulmonary thrombosis did not predict survival 462 survivors vs 417 nonsurvivors, pu2009u20090796, but RV dilatation was less frequent among survivors 115 survivors vs 583 nonsurvivors, pu2009u20090002 Over the following month, we observed four Covid19 patients, who were admitted with high and intermediatehigh risk PE, and we treated them with UACTD ultrasoundassisted catheterdirected thrombolysis, and four further patients, who were admitted with PE up to 4xa0weeks after recovery from Covid19 Finally, we observed a case of RV dysfunction and precapillary pulmonary hypertension, associated with Covid19 extensive lung disease We demonstrated that pulmonary thrombosis is common in association with Covid19 Also, the thrombotic risk in the pulmonary vasculature is present before and during hospital admission, and continues at least up to four weeks after discharge, and we present UACTD for high and intermediatehigh risk PE management in Covid19 patients,The novel human coronavirus of 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2, has quickly swept throughout the entire world As the ongoing pandemic has spread, recent studies have described children presenting with a multisystem inflammatory disorder sharing the features of Kawasaki disease KD and toxic shock syndrome, now named Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children MISC These cases report a similar phenotype of prolonged fever, multisystem involvement, and biomarkers demonstrating marked hyperinflammation that occurs temporally in association with local community spread of SARSCoV2 Herein, we describe the presentation, clinical characteristics, and management of an 11yearold boy with prolonged fever, strikingly elevated inflammatory markers, and profound, early coronary artery aneurysm consistent with a hyperinflammatory, multisystem disease temporally associated with coronavirus disease 2019 We highlight our multidisciplinary teams management with intravenous immunoglobulin, methylprednisolone, and an interleukin1 receptor antagonist, anakinra, as a strategy to manage this multisystem, hyperinflammatory disease process,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 SARSCoV2 is the virus responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic The angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2 has been proven to be used by SARSCoV2 for host cell entry Considering that angiotensin receptor blockers and ACE inhibitors ACEIs upregulate the expression of ACE2 in animal studies, there may be a concern about whether these drugs may increase COVID19 susceptibility and severity Recently, there has been a debate among clinicians about whether to continue or to stop ACEIs and angiotensin receptor blockers in the context of COVID19 Also, some media outlets and health systems have called for the discontinuation of these drugs in the context of suspected COVID19 This has necessitated an urgent release of guidance on the use of such medications in COVID19 patients To date, multiple theories relating to the pure effects of reninangiotensinaldosterone system RAAS inhibitors on COVID19 infections have been postulated Favorable effects include blocking the ACE2 receptors, preventing viral entry into the heart and lungs, and protecting against lung injury in COVID19 Adverse effects include a possible retrograde feedback mechanism that upregulates ACE2 receptors This review provides greater insight into the role of the RAAS axis in acute lung injury and the effects of RAAS inhibitors on SARSCoVs The hypothesis that RAAS inhibitors facilitate viral insertion and the alternative hypothesis of the beneficial role of these drugs are discussed Uptodate published data concerning the RAAS inhibitors and COVID19 are summarized,Viral respiratory diseases constitute the most common reasons for hospitalization with more than half of all acute illnesses worldwide Progressive respiratory failure with pronounced diffuse alveolar damage has been identified as the primary cause of death in COVID19 COVID19 pneumonia shares common histopathological hallmarks with influenza H1N1related ARDS, like diffuse alveolar damage DAD with edema, hemorrhage, and intraalveolar fibrin deposition The lungs with COVID19 pneumonia revealed perivascular inflammation, an endothelial injury, microangiopathy, and an aberrant blood vessel neoformation by intussusceptive angiogenesis While this pronounced angiocentric inflammation is likely be found  to varying degrees  in numerous other organs, eg, the heart, COVID19 is hypothesized to be not just axa0pulmonary, but rather axa0systemic vascular disease,BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE Additional time is needed to determine the exact impact of COVID19 on acute cerebrovascular disease incidence, but recently published data has correlated COVID19 to large vessel occlusion strokes CLINICAL PRESENTATION We report the first case of central retinal artery occlusion CRAO as the initial manifestation of COVID19 infection Subsequent neuroimaging revealed a large thrombus extending into the internal carotid artery CONCLUSION This case illustrates the need to suspect COVID19 infection in patients presenting with retinal arterial occlusion, including individuals who are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic for COVID19 infection,AIMS Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 It can lead to multiorgan failure, including respiratory and cardiovascular decompensation, and kidney injury, with significant associated morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with underlying metabolic, cardiovascular, respiratory or kidney disease Dapagliflozin, a sodiumglucose cotransporter2 inhibitor, has shown significant cardio and renoprotective benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes with and without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure and chronic kidney disease, and may provide similar organ protection in highrisk patients with COVID19 MATERIALS AND METHODS DARE19 NCT04350593 is an investigatorinitiated, collaborative, international, multicentre, randomized, doubleblind, placebocontrolled study testing the dual hypotheses that dapagliflozin can reduce the incidence of cardiovascular, kidney andor respiratory complications or allcause mortality, or improve clinical recovery, in adult patients hospitalized with COVID19 but not critically ill on admission Eligible patients will have 1 cardiometabolic risk factor for COVID19 complications Patients will be randomized 11 to dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo Primary efficacy endpoints are time to development of new or worsened organ dysfunction during index hospitalization, or allcause mortality, and the hierarchical composite endpoint of change in clinical status through day 30 of treatment Safety of dapagliflozin in individuals with COVID19 will be assessed CONCLUSIONS DARE19 will evaluate whether dapagliflozin can prevent COVID19related complications and allcause mortality, or improve clinical recovery, and assess the safety profile of dapagliflozin in this patient population Currently, DARE19 is the first large randomized controlled trial investigating use of sodiumglucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in patients with COVID19,OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to evaluate inhospital outcomes among patients with a history of heart failure HF hospitalized with coronavirus disease2019 COVID19 BACKGROUND Cardiometabolic comorbidities are common in patients with severe COVID19 Patients with HF may be particularly susceptible to COVID19 complications METHODS The Premier Healthcare Database was used to identify patients with at least 1 HF hospitalization or 2 HF outpatient visits between January 1, 2019, and March 31, 2020, who were subsequently hospitalized between April and September 2020 Baseline characteristics, health care resource utilization, and mortality rates were compared between those hospitalized with COVID19 and those hospitalized with other causes Predictors of inhospital mortality were identified in HF patients hospitalized with COVID19 by using multivariate logistic regression RESULTS Among 1,212,153 patients with history of HF, 132,312 patients were hospitalized from April 1, 2020, to September 30, 2020 A total of 23,843 patients 180 were hospitalized with acute HF, 8,383 patients 64 were hospitalized with COVID19, and 100,068 patients 756 were hospitalized with alternative reasons Hospitalization with COVID19 was associated with greater odds of inhospital mortality as compared with hospitalization with acute HF 242 of patients hospitalized with COVID19 died inhospital compared to 26 of those hospitalized with acute HF This association was strongest in April adjusted odds ratio OR 1448 95 confidence interval CI1225 to 1712 than in subsequent months adjusted OR 1011 95xa0CI 895 to 1142 pinteractionxa00001 Among patients with HF hospitalized with COVID19, male sex adjusted OR 126 95xa0CI 113 to 140 and morbid obesity adjusted OR 125 95xa0CI 107 to 146 were associated with greater odds of inhospital mortality, along with age adjusted OR 135 95xa0CI 129 to 142 per 10 years and admission earlier in the pandemic CONCLUSIONS Patients with HF hospitalized with COVID19 are at high risk for complications, with nearly 1 in 4 dying during hospitalization,,,BACKGROUND Cardiac injury is common in patients who are hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 and portends poorer prognosis However, the mechanism and the type of myocardial damage associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 remain uncertain METHODS We conducted a systematic pathological analysis of 40 hearts from hospitalized patients dying of COVID19 in Bergamo, Italy, to determine the pathological mechanisms of cardiac injury We divided the hearts according to presence or absence of acute myocyte necrosis and then determined the underlying mechanisms of cardiac injury RESULTS Of the 40 hearts examined, 14 35 had evidence of myocyte necrosis, predominantly of the left ventricle Compared with subjects without necrosis, subjects with necrosis tended to be female, have chronic kidney disease, and have shorter symptom onset to admission The incidence of severe coronary artery disease ie, 75 crosssectional narrowing was not significantly different between those with and without necrosis Three of 14 214 subjects with myocyte necrosis showed evidence of acute myocardial infarction, defined as 1 cm2 area of necrosis, whereas 11 of 14 786 showed evidence of focal 20 necrotic myocytes with an area of 005 mm2 but 1 cm2 myocyte necrosis Cardiac thrombi were present in 11 of 14 786 cases with necrosis, with 2 of 14 142 having epicardial coronary artery thrombi, whereas 9 of 14 643 had microthrombi in myocardial capillaries, arterioles, and small muscular arteries We compared cardiac microthrombi from COVID19positive autopsy cases to intramyocardial thromboemboli from COVID19 cases as well as to aspirated thrombi obtained during primary percutaneous coronary intervention from uninfected and COVID19infected patients presenting with STsegmentelevation myocardial infarction Microthrombi had significantly greater fibrin and terminal complement C5b9 immunostaining compared with intramyocardial thromboemboli from COVID19negative subjects and with aspirated thrombi There were no significant differences between the constituents of thrombi aspirated from COVID19positive and negative patients with STsegmentelevation myocardial infarction CONCLUSIONS The most common pathological cause of myocyte necrosis was microthrombi Microthrombi were different in composition from intramyocardial thromboemboli from COVID19negative subjects and from coronary thrombi retrieved from COVID19positive and negative patients with STsegmentelevation myocardial infarction Tailored antithrombotic strategies may be useful to counteract the cardiac effects of COVID19 infection,BackgroundThe Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic is a worldwide health crisis Limited information is available regarding which patients will experience more severe disease symptoms We evaluated hospitalized patients who were initially diagnosed with moderate COVID19 for clinical parameters and radiological feature that showed an association with progression to severecritical symptomsMethodsThis study, a retrospective singlecenter study at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, enrolled 243 patients with confirmed COVIDxad19 pneumonia Forty of these patients progressed from moderate to severecritical symptoms during follow up Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between moderate and severecriticaltype symptoms Univariable and multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify the risk factors associated with symptom progressionResultsPatients with severecritical symptoms were older pu2009u200911 had the greatest predictive value for disease progression The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0861 95 confidence interval 08110902ConclusionsMaximum CT score and COPD were associated with patient deterioration Maximum CT score u200911 was associated with severe illness,OBJECTIVE The HOME BP Home and Online Management and Evaluation of Blood Pressure trial aimed to test a digital intervention for hypertension management in primary care by combining selfmonitoring of blood pressure with guided selfmanagement DESIGN Unmasked randomised controlled trial with automated ascertainment of primary endpoint SETTING 76 general practices in the United Kingdom PARTICIPANTS 622 people with treated but poorly controlled hypertension 14090 mmu2009Hg and access to the internet INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomised by using a minimisation algorithm to selfmonitoring of blood pressure with a digital intervention 305 participants or usual care routine hypertension care, with appointments and drug changes made at the discretion of the general practitioner 317 participants The digital intervention provided feedback of blood pressure results to patients and professionals with optional lifestyle advice and motivational support Target blood pressure for hypertension, diabetes, and people aged 80 or older followed UK national guidelines MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was the difference in systolic blood pressure mean of second and third readings after one year, adjusted for baseline blood pressure, blood pressure target, age, and practice, with multiple imputation for missing values RESULTS After one year, data were available from 552 participants 886 with imputation for the remaining 70 participants 114 Mean blood pressure dropped from 1517864 to 1384802 mmu2009Hg in the intervention group and from 1516853 to 1418798 mmu2009Hg in the usual care group, giving a mean difference in systolic blood pressure of 34 mmu2009Hg 95 confidence interval 61 to 08 mmu2009Hg and a mean difference in diastolic blood pressure of 05 mmu2009Hg 19 to 09 mmu2009Hg Results were comparable in the complete case analysis and adverse effects were similar between groups Within trial costs showed an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of 11 15, €12 95 confidence interval 6 to 29 per mmu2009Hg reduction CONCLUSIONS The HOME BP digital intervention for the management of hypertension by using selfmonitored blood pressure led to better control of systolic blood pressure after one year than usual care, with low incremental costs Implementation in primary care will require integration into clinical workflows and consideration of people who are digitally excluded TRIAL REGISTRATION ISRCTN13790648,BACKGROUND Children and older adults with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 display a distinct spectrum of disease severity yet the risk factors arent well understood We sought to examine the expression pattern of angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2, the cellentry receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2, and the role of lung progenitor cells in children and older patients METHODS We retrospectively analysed clinical features in a cohort of 299 patients with COVID19 The expression and distribution of ACE2 and lung progenitor cells were systematically examined using a combination of public singlecell RNAseq datasets, lung biopsies, and ex vivo infection of lung tissues with SARSCoV2 pseudovirus in children and older adults We also followed up patients who had recovered from COVID19 RESULTS Compared with children, older patients  50 yrs were more likely to develop into serious pneumonia with reduced lymphocytes and aberrant inflammatory response p  0001 The expression level of ACE2 and lung progenitor cell markers were generally decreased in older patients Notably, ACE2 positive cells were mainly distributed in the alveolar region, including SFTPC positive cells, but rarely in airway regions in the older adults p  001 The followup of discharged patients revealed a prolonged recovery from pneumonia in the older p  0025 CONCLUSION Compared to children, ACE2 positive cells are generally decreased in older adults and mainly presented in the lower pulmonary tract The lung progenitor cells are also decreased These risk factors may impact disease severity and recovery from pneumonia caused by SARSCov2 infection in older patients,AIM To study the characteristics and outcome among cardiac arrest cases with COVID19 and differences between the prepandemic and the pandemic period in outofhospital cardiac arrest OHCA and inhospital cardiac arrest IHCA METHOD AND RESULTS We included all patients reported to the Swedish Registry for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation from 1 January to 20 July 2020 We defined 16 March 2020 as the start of the pandemic We assessed overall and 30day mortality using Cox regression and logistic regression, respectively We studied 1946 cases of OHCA and 1080 cases of IHCA during the entire period During the pandemic, 88 100 of OHCAs and 72 161 of IHCAs had ongoing COVID19 With regards to OHCA during the pandemic, the odds ratio for 30day mortality in COVID19positive cases, compared with COVID19negative cases, was 340 95 confidence interval CI 1311164 the corresponding hazard ratio was 145 95 CI 113185 Adjusted 30day survival was 47 for patients with COVID19, 98 for patients without COVID19, and 76 in the prepandemic period With regards to IHCA during the pandemic, the odds ratio for COVID19positive cases, compared with COVID19negative cases, was 227 95 CI 127424 the corresponding hazard ratio was 148 95 CI 109201 Adjusted 30day survival was 231 in COVID19positive cases, 395 in patients without COVID19, and 364 in the prepandemic period CONCLUSION During the pandemic phase, COVID19 was involved in at least 10 of all OHCAs and 16 of IHCAs, and, among COVID19 cases, 30day mortality was increased 34fold in OHCA and 23fold in IHCA,In critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19, a high incidence of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events is reported COVID19 may lead to impairment of the coagulation cascade, with an imbalance in platelet function and the regulatory mechanisms of coagulation and fibrinolysis Clinical manifestations vary from a rise in laboratory markers and subclinical microthrombi to thromboembolic events, bleeding, and disseminated intravascular coagulation After an inflammatory trigger, the mechanism for activation of the coagulation cascade in COVID19 is the tissue factor pathway, which causes endotoxin and tumor necrosis factormediated production of interleukins and platelet activation The consequent massive infiltration of activated platelets may be responsible for inflammatory infiltrates in the endothelial space, as well as thrombocytopenia The variety of clinical presentations of the coagulopathy confronts the clinician with the difficult questions of whether and how to provide optimal supportive care In addition to coagulation tests, advanced laboratory tests such as protein C, protein S, antithrombin, tissue factor pathway inhibitors, Ddimers, activated factor Xa, and quantification of specific coagulation factors can be useful, as can thromboelastography or thromboelastometry Treatment should be tailored, focusing on the estimated risk of bleeding and thrombosis The aim of this review is to explore the pathophysiology and clinical evidence of coagulation disorders in severe ARDSrelated COVID19 patients,,STUDY OBJECTIVES The COVID19 pandemic required sleep centers to consider and implement infection control strategies to mitigate viral transmission to patients and staff Our aim was to assess measures taken by sleep centers due to the COVID19 pandemic and plans surrounding reinstatement of sleep services METHODS We distributed an anonymous online survey to health care providers in sleep medicine on April 29, 2020 From responders, we identified a subset of unique centers by region and demographic variables RESULTS We obtained 379 individual responses, which represented 297 unique centers A total of 936 of unique centers reported stopping all or nearly all sleep testing of at least one type, without significant differences between adult and pediatric labs, geographic region, or surrounding population density By contrast, a greater proportion of respondents continued home sleep apnea testing services A total of 603 reduced home sleep apnea testing volume by at least 90, compared to 904 that reduced inlaboratory testing by at least 90 Respondents acknowledged that they implemented a wide variety of mitigation strategies While no respondents reported virtual visits to be  25 of clinical visits prior to the pandemic, more than half 519 anticipated maintaining  25 virtual visits after the pandemic CONCLUSIONS Among surveyed sleep centers, the vast majority reported nearcessation of inlaboratory sleep studies, while a smaller proportion reported reductions in home sleep apnea tests A large increase in the use of telemedicine was reported, with the majority of respondents expecting the use of telehealth to endure in the future,The COVID19 pandemic has had farreaching consequences beyond the disease itself, including economic, social, political, religious, and psychological implications This novel coronavirus has been shown to have cardiovascular manifestations in the form of arrhythmias, conduction disturbances, myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathy, myocardial injury and myocardial ischemia or infarction from increased microvascular andor macrovascular coagulopathy However, in addition to these direct effects, we are now starting to recognize indirect cardiovascular effects of COVID19 in the form of increased incidence of Takutsobo cardiomyopathy in patients without any evidence of coronavirus infection presumably due to the increased psychological stress of social isolation and societal turbulence In this case series, we present two postmenopausal women, presenting with chest pain and acute coronary syndrome, who are finally diagnosed with stress cardiomyopathy, triggered by increased emotional stressrelated to the pandemic There is data from a retrospective cohort analysis showing a fourfold increase in the incidence of acute coronary syndrome resulting from stress cardiomyopathy during the pandemic period compared to similar times periods before the pandemic Hence, health care providers need to be cognizant of the emotional ramifications of the ongoing pandemic in the form of increased risk of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy Moreover, urgent measures need to be taken to help the atrisk population cope with the ongoing stressors to help decrease the incidence of this cardiomyopathy,BACKGROUND To accurately diagnose and control heart failure HF, it is important to carry out a simple assessment of elevated pulmonary arterial wedge pressure PAWP The aim of this study was to develop and validate an objective method for detecting elevated PAWP by applying deep learning DL to a chest Xray CXR METHODS We enrolled 1,013 consecutive patients with a right heart catheter between October 2009 and February 2020 We developed a convolutional neural network to identify patients with an elevated PAWP  18 mmHg as the actual value of PAWP to be used in the dataset for training In the prospective validation dataset used to detect elevated PAWP, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve AUC was calculated using the DL model that evaluated the CXR RESULTS In the prospective validation dataset, the AUC of the DL model with CXR was not significantly different than the AUC produced by brain natriuretic peptide and the echocardiographic left ventricular diastolic dysfunction algorithm DL model 077 vs BNP 077 vs DD algorithm 070 respectively pNS for all comparisons, however was significantly higher than the AUC of the cardiothoracic ratio DL model vs CTR 066, p0044 The model based on three parameters BNP, DD algorithm, and CTR was improved by adding the DL model AUC from 080 to 086 p0041 CONCLUSIONS Applying the DL model based on a CXR a classical, universal, and lowcost test is useful for screening for elevated PAWP,We are witnessing an unparalleled pandemic caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 associated with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 Current data show that SARSCoV2 results in mild flulike symptoms in the majority of healthy and young patients affected Nevertheless, the severity of COVID19 respiratory syndrome and the risk of adverse or catastrophic outcomes are increased in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease Patients with adult congenital heart disease ACHDby definitionhave underlying cardiovascular disease Many patients with ACHD are also afflicted with residual haemodynamic lesions such as valve dysfunction, diminished ventricular function, arrhythmias or cyanosis, have extracardiac comorbidities, and face additional challenges regarding pregnancy Currently, there are emerging data of the effect of COVID19 on ACHD patients, but many aspects, especially risk stratification and treatment considerations, remain unclear In this article, we aim to discuss the broad impact of COVID19 on ACHD patients, focusing specifically on pathophysiology, risk stratification for work, selfisolation, hospitalization, impact on pregnancy, psychosocial health, and longerterm implications for the provision of ACHD care,,The novel COVID19 has had an unprecedented and devastating spread internationally COVID19 infection can lead to a number of cardiovascular sequelae, including heart failure, which may portend worse clinical outcomes Here, we report a rare case of a 57yearold woman who developed acute left ventricular systolic dysfunction with apical ballooning consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy TCM, and mixed cardiogenic and septic shock in the setting of COVID19 disease We briefly review the pathophysiology and diagnosis of TCM also described as apical ballooning syndrome and stressinduced cardiomyopathy Additionally, this case highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to clinical decisionmaking and resource allocation in diagnosis and management of critical illness in the setting of the ongoing international COVID19 pandemic,The study of human macrophages and their ontogeny is an important unresolved issue Here, we use a humanized mouse model expressing human cytokines to dissect the development of lung macrophages from human hematopoiesis inxa0vivo Human CD34 hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells HSPCs generated three macrophage populations, occupying separate anatomical niches in the lung Intravascular cell labeling, cell transplantation, and fatemapping studies established that classical CD14 blood monocytes derived from HSPCs migrated into lung tissue and gave rise to human interstitial and alveolar macrophages In contrast, nonclassical CD16 blood monocytes preferentially generated macrophages resident in the lung vasculature pulmonary intravascular macrophages Finally, singlecell RNA sequencing defined intermediate differentiation stages in human lung macrophage development from blood monocytes This study identifies distinct developmental pathways from circulating monocytes to lung macrophages and reveals how cellular origin contributes to human macrophage identity, diversity, and localization inxa0vivo,,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2, has become a pandemic The cellular receptor for SARSCoV2 entry is the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2, a membranebound homolog of angiotensinconverting enzyme Henceforth, this has brought the attention of the scientific community to study the interaction between COVID19 and the reninangiotensin system RAS, as well as RAS inhibitors However, these inhibitors are commonly used to treat hypertension, chronic kidney disorder, and diabetes Obesity is a known risk factor for heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension, whereas diabetes and hypertension may be indirectly related to each other through the effects of obesity Furthermore, people with hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and other related complications like cardiovascular and kidney diseases have a higher risk of severe COVID19 infection than the general population and usually exhibit poor prognosis This severity could be due to systemic inflammation and compromised immune response and RAS associated with these comorbid conditions Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop evidencebased treatment methods that do not affect the severity of COVID19 infection and effectively manage these chronic diseases in people with COVID19,ABSTRACT There is increasing evidence that novel coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 leads to a significant coagulopathy, a phenomenon termed COVID19 associated coagulopathy COVID19 has been associated with increased rates of both venous and arterial thromboembolic events, a source of significant morbidity and mortality in this disease Further evidence suggests a link between the inflammatory response and coagulopathy associated with COVID19 This presents a unique set of challenges for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of thrombotic complications In this review, we summarize and discuss the current literature on laboratory coagulation disruptions associated with COVID19 and the clinical effects of thromboembolic events including pulmonary embolism PE, deep vein thrombosis DVT, peripheral arterial thrombosis, and acute ischemic stroke in COVID19 Endothelial injury and augmented innate immune response are implicated in the development of diffuse macro and microvascular thrombosis in COVID19 The pathophysiology of COVID19 associated coagulopathy is an important determinant of appropriate treatment and monitoring of these complications We highlight the importance of diagnosis and management of dysregulated coagulation in COVID19 in order to improve outcomes in COVID19 patients with thromboembolic complications,AIMS Extensive research regarding the association of troponin and prognosis in coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 has been performed However, data regarding natriuretic peptides are scarce Nterminal pro Btype natriuretic peptide NTproBNP reflects haemodynamic stress and has proven useful for risk stratification in heart failure HF and other conditions such as pulmonary embolism and pneumonia We aimed to adequately characterize NTproBNP concentrations using a large cohort of patients with COVID19, and to investigate its association with prognosis METHODS AND RESULTS Consecutive patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 infection and available NTproBNP determinations, from March 1st to April 20th, 2020 who completed at least 1month followup or died, were studied Of 3080 screened patients, a total of 396 mean age 718u2009u2009146u2009years, 611 male fulfilled all the selection criteria and were finally included, with a median followup of 53 1862 days Of those, 192 485 presented NTproBNP levels above the recommended cutoff for the identification of HF However, only 47 fulfilled the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of HF Patients with higher NTproBNP during admission experienced more frequent bleeding, arrhythmias and HF decompensations NTproBNP was associated with mortality both in the whole study population and after excluding patients with HF A multivariable Cox model confirmed that NTproBNP was independently associated with mortality after adjusting for all relevant confounders hazard ratio 128, 95 confidence interval 113144, per logarithmic unit CONCLUSION NTproBNP is frequently elevated in COVID19 It is strongly and independently associated with mortality after adjusting for relevant confounders, including chronic HF and acute HF Therefore, its use may improve early prognostic stratification in this condition,BackgroundSARSCoV2, the virus that causes COVID19, enters the cells through a mechanism dependent on its binding to angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2, a protein highly expressed in the lungs The putative viralinduced inhibition of ACE2 could result in the defective degradation of bradykinin, a potent inflammatory substance We hypothesize that increased bradykinin in the lungs is an important mechanism driving the development of pneumonia and respiratory failure in COVID19MethodsThis is a phase II, singlecenter, threearmed parallelgroup, openlabel, active control superiority randomized clinical trial One hundred eighty eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 111 ratio to receive either the inhibitor of C1ekallikrein 20u2009Ukg intravenously on day 1 and day 4 plus standard care or icatibant 30u2009mg subcutaneously, three dosesday for 4u2009days plus standard care or standard care alone, as recommended in the clinical trials published to date, which includes supplemental oxygen, noninvasive and invasive ventilation, antibiotic agents, antiinflammatory agents, prophylactic antithrombotic therapy, vasopressor support, and renal replacement therapyDiscussionAccumulation of bradykinin in the lungs is a common side effect of ACE inhibitors leading to cough In animal models, the inactivation of ACE2 leads to severe acute pneumonitis in response to lipopolysaccharide LPS, and the inhibition of bradykinin almost completely restores the lung structure We believe that inhibition of bradykinin in severe COVID19 patients could reduce the lung inflammatory response, impacting positively on the severity of disease and mortality ratesTrial registrationBrazilian Clinical Trials Registry Universal Trial Number UTN U111112501843 Registered on May52020,BACKGROUND The aim was to describe the incidence and risk factors of barotrauma in patients with the Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 on invasive mechanical ventilation, during the outbreak in our region Lombardy, Italy METHODS The study was an electronic survey open from March 27th to May 2nd, 2020 Patients with COVID19 who developed barotrauma while on invasive mechanical ventilation from 61 hospitals of the COVID19 Lombardy Intensive Care Unit network were involved RESULTS The response rate was 3861 62 The incidence of barotrauma was 1452041 71 95CI 6183 Only a few cases occurred with ventilatory settings that may be considered nonprotective such as a plateau airway pressure 35 cmH2O 2113 2, a driving airway pressure 15 cmH2O 30113 27, or a tidal volume 8 mLkg of ideal body weight and a plateau airway pressure 30 cmH2O 12134 9 CONCLUSIONS Within the limits of a survey, patients with COVID19 might be at high risk for barotrauma during invasive and allegedly lungprotective mechanical ventilation,The SARSCoV2 pandemic has inspired renewed interest in understanding the fundamental pathology of acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS following infection because fatal COVID19 cases are commonly linked to respiratory failure due to ARDS The pathologic alteration known as diffuse alveolar damage in endothelial and epithelial cells is a critical feature of acute lung injury in ARDS However, the pathogenesis of ARDS following SRASCoV2 infection remains largely unknown In the present study, we examined apoptosis in postmortem lung sections from COVID19 patients and lung tissues from a nonhuman primate model of SARSCoV2 infection, in a celltype manner, including type 1 and 2 alveolar cells and vascular endothelial cells ECs, macrophages, and T cells Multipletarget immunofluorescence IF assays and western blotting suggest both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways are activated during SARSCoV2 infection Furthermore, we observed that SARSCoV2 fails to induce apoptosis in human bronchial epithelial cells ie, BEAS2B cells and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells HUVECs, which are refractory to SARSCoV2 infection However, infection of cocultured Vero cells and HUVECs or Vero cells and BEAS2B cells with SARSCoV2 induced apoptosis in both Vero cells and HUVECsBEAS2B cells, but did not alter the permissiveness of HUVECs or BEAS2B cells to the virus Postexposure treatment of the coculture of Vero cells and HUVECs with an EPAC1specific activator ameliorated apoptosis in HUVECs These findings may help to delineate a novel insight into the pathogenesis of ARDS following SARSCoV2 infection,The rapid dissemination of SARSCoV2 has made COVID19 a tremendous social, economic, and health burden Despite the efforts to understand the virus and treat the disease, many questions remain unanswered about COVID19 mechanisms of infection and progression Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome SARS infection can affect several organs in the body including the heart, which can result in thromboembolism, myocardial injury, acute coronary syndromes, and arrhythmias Numerous cardiac adverse events, from cardiomyocyte death to secondary effects caused by exaggerated immunological response against the virus, have been clinically reported In addition to the disease itself, repurposing of treatments by using off label drugs can also contribute to cardiotoxicity Over the past several decades, animal models and more recently, stem cellderived cardiomyocytes have been proposed for studying diseases and testing treatments in vitro In addition, mechanistic in silico models have been widely used for disease and drug studies In these models, several characteristics such as gender, electrolyte imbalance, and comorbidities can be implemented to study pathophysiology of cardiac diseases and to predict cardiotoxicity of drug treatments In this Mini Review, we 1 present the state of the art of in vitro and in silico cardiomyocyte modeling currently in use to study COVID19, 2 review in vitro and in silico models that can be adopted to mimic the effects of SARSCoV2 infection on cardiac function, and 3 provide a perspective on how to combine some of these models to mimic COVID19 cardiomyocytes environment,Smooth muscles are a specific muscle subtype that is widely identified in the tissues of internal passageways This muscle subtype has the capacity for controlled or regulated contraction and relaxation Airway smooth muscles are a unique type of smooth muscles that constitute the effective, adjustable, and reactive wall that covers most areas of the entire airway from the trachea to lung tissues Infection with SARSCoV2, which caused the worldwide COVID19 pandemic, involves airway smooth muscles and their surrounding inflammatory environment Therefore, airway smooth muscles and related inflammatory factors may play an irreplaceable role in the initiation and progression of several severe diseases Many previous studies have attempted to reveal the potential relationships between interleukins and airway smooth muscle cells only on the omics level, and the continued existence of numerous falsepositive optimal genestranscripts cannot reflect the actual effective biological mechanisms underlying interleukinbased activation effects on airway smooth muscles Here, on the basis of newly presented machine learningbased computational approaches, we identified specific regulatory factors and a series of rules that contribute to the activation and stimulation of airway smooth muscles by IL13, IL17, or the combination of both interleukins on the epigenetic andor transcriptional levels The detected discriminative factors genes and rules can contribute to the identification of potential regulatory mechanisms linking airway smooth muscle tissues and inflammatory factors and help reveal specific pathological factors for diseases associated with airway smooth muscle inflammation on multiomics levels,BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE COVID19 is complicated by acute lung injury, and death in some individuals It is caused by SARSCoV2 that requires the ACE2 receptor and serine proteases to enter AEC We determined what factors are associated with ACE2 expression particularly in patients with asthma and COPD METHODS We obtained lower AEC from 145 people from two independent cohorts, aged 289u2009years, Newcastle n  115 and Perth n  30, Australia The Newcastle cohort was enriched with people with asthma n  37 and COPD n  38 Gene expression for ACE2 and other genes potentially associated with SARSCoV2 cell entry was assessed by qPCR, and protein expression was confirmed with immunohistochemistry on endobronchial biopsies and cultured AEC RESULTS Increased gene expression of ACE2 was associated with older age P  003 and male sex P  003, but not with packyears smoked When we compared gene expression between adults with asthma, COPD and healthy controls, mean ACE2 expression was lower in asthma patients P  001 Gene expression of furin, a protease that facilitates viral endocytosis, was also lower in patients with asthma P  002, while ADAM17, a disintegrin that cleaves ACE2 from the surface, was increased P  002 ACE2 protein expression was also reduced in endobronchial biopsies from asthma patients CONCLUSION Increased ACE2 expression occurs in older people and males Asthma patients have reduced expression Altered ACE2 expression in the lower airway may be an important factor in virus tropism and may in part explain susceptibility factors and why asthma patients are not overrepresented in those with COVID19 complications,,Since the earliest cases of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 infection were reported, our care delivery systems have been reorganized and challenged in unprecedent ways, specifically the cardiovascular community COVID19 poses a challenge for heart transplantation, affecting donor selection, immunosuppression, and posttransplant management Left Ventricular Assist Device LVAD therapy is currently a viable option for patients with endstage heart failure as a bridge to heart transplantation or destination therapy Here, we present a therapeutic strategy for the management of acute HF with Intermacs profiles from 1 to 4, with or without Covid19 infection, exemplified by serie of patients presenting with severe HF and successfully treated by LVAD therapy during the spread of the Covid19 pandemic and the French national lockdown This experience has shown that we still have the capacity to provide the right therapy for the right disease to the right patient LVAD implantation seems to be the treatment of choice for advanced HF due to the lack of healthy donor hearts for cardiac transplantation Covid or nonCovid context, we have to take care of our patients with endstage HF the best we can,Objectives In the present singlecentered, retrospective, observational study, we reported findings from 78 consecutive laboratoryconfirmed COVID19 patients with moderatetosevere acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS hospitalized in an intermediate Respiratory Intensive Care Unit, subdividing the patients into two groups according to their clinical outcome, dead patients and discharged patients Methods We further subdivided patients depending on the noninvasive respiratory support used during hospitalization Results In those patients who died, we found significant older age and higher multimorbidity and higher values of serum lactate dehydrogenase, Creactive protein, and Ddimer Among patients who were submitted to bilevel positive airway pressure BPAP, those who died had a significant shorter number of days in overall length of stay and lower values of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen ratio PaO2FiO2 ratio compared to those who survived No difference in allcause mortality was observed between the two different noninvasive respiratory support groups 48 for continuous positive airway pressure CPAP and 52 for BPAP Conclusion In COVID19 patients with moderatetosevere ARDS using BPAP in an intermediate level of hospital care had more factors associated to allcause mortality shorter length of stay and lower baseline PaO2FiO2 ratio compared to those who underwent CPAP,BACKGROUND Severity and extent of coronary artery disease CAD assessed by invasive coronary angiography ICA guide treatment and may predict clinical outcome in patients with nonSTsegment elevation acute coronary syndrome NSTEACS OBJECTIVES This study tested the hypothesis that coronary computed tomography angiography CTA is equivalent to ICA for risk assessment in patients with NSTEACS METHODS The VERDICT Very Early Versus Deferred Invasive Evaluation Using Computerized Tomography in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndromes trial evaluated timing of treatment in relation to outcome in patients with NSTEACS and included a clinically blinded coronary CTA conducted prior to ICA Severity of CAD was defined as obstructive coronary stenosisxa050 or nonobstructive Extent of CAD was defined as high risk obstructive left main or proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis andor multivessel disease or nonhigh risk The primary endpoint was a composite of allcause death, nonfatal recurrent myocardial infarction, hospital admission for refractory myocardial ischemia, or heart failure RESULTS Coronary CTA and ICA were conducted in 978 patients During a median followup time of 42 years interquartile range 27 to 55 years, the primary endpoint occurred in 208 patients 213 The rate of the primary endpoint was up to 17fold higher in patients with obstructive CAD compared with in patients with nonobstructive CAD as defined by coronary CTA hazard ratio HR 174 95 confidence interval CI 122 to 249 pxa0xa00002 or ICA HR 154 95xa0CI 113 to 211 pxa0xa00007 In patients with highrisk CAD, the rate of the primary endpoint was 15fold higher compared with the rate in those with nonhighrisk CAD as defined by coronary CTA HR 156 95xa0CI 118 to 207 pxa0xa00002 A similar trend was noted for ICA HR 128 95xa0CI 098 to 169 pxa0xa0007 CONCLUSIONS Coronary CTA is equivalent to ICA for the assessment of longterm risk in patients with NSTEACS Very Early Versus Deferred Invasive Evaluation Using Computerized Tomography in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndromes VERDICT NCT02061891,COVID19 pandemic is causing an unprecedented burden on healthcare resources and this includes treatment of heart failure and valvular heart diseases VHD Percutaneous procedures have broadened the number of patients with VHD who could be treated However, COVID19 pandemic has challenged their implementation The risk of inhospital infection, resources reallocation, reduced access to hospital caused a substantial delay of VHD treatment with an increased risk of clinical worsening and mortality Now, the pandemic is not ended and subsequent waves are likely Reorganization of our healthcare resources is needed, including a proper algorithm for patients prioritization, based on the severity of their valve disease, their life expectancy, complexity of the intervention, and the resources available A wider use of telemedicine for patients selection and followup and any measurement that can shorten the duration of the hospital stay must be adopted Patients and healthcare staff screening for COVID19 and all needed procedures to prevent infection will continue to be mandatory Percutaneous procedures, compared to surgery, are associated with a lower risk of infection and a lower need for inhospital resources, including a shorter duration of hospital stay This may favour their adoption when the risk of viral infection is high,The majority of children with COVID19 infections, fortunately, shows only milder symptoms Which however has led that they are considered only for their particular transmission potential Nevertheless, cases with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children and Kawasaki Disease with quite specific COVID19 involvement have been reported and should be taken seriously In addition, there are many children with a chronic preexisting condition such as congenital heart disease, cancer, or lung disease who may be at risk for a severe course of COVID19 when infected Protecting these children, and children in general, should be a top priority, as these patients will have to live the rest of their long lives with possible sequelae of COVID19,Highlights    • Adalimumab may be a promising agent for the management of COVID19   • Healing speed of the lungs with adalimumab in COVID19 is considerable   • Adalimumab could be a fast way to control the overinflammation of COVID19,Background As the global COVID19 pandemic has unfolded, there has been much debate surrounding the optimal management of patients with asthma who are at risk of or contract COVID19, whether asthma and steroids are risk factors for severe COVID19, and how transmissible the virus is among children Objective The objective of this study is to provide allergists and other clinicians with pearls pertaining to the management of patients with asthma in the setting of the COVID19 pandemic and to provide some information regarding the risk of transmission among the pediatric population Methods Utilizing the case of one of our own patients with asthma who developed COVID19 as context, we review the recent literature discussing the risk of COVID19 in patients with asthma, the management of asthma medications in the time of the pandemic, and the risk of viral transmission Results Despite initial reports that asthma was a risk factor for developing severe COVID19, subsequent investigation has shown that this is likely not true Additionally, the use of systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids does not appear to increase the risk of severe COVID19, but there is no evidence guiding the use of biologic therapy There is conflicting evidence regarding the ability of children to transmit the virus Conclusion We provide pearls that asthma does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of COVID19 and continued use of inhaled corticosteroids appears to be safe While there is no evidence guiding the use of biologic therapies, a recent position paper suggests that they should be continued unless a patient contracts COVID19, at which point they should be held until clinical recovery occurs,COVID19 has put each and every one at test Cardiological clinics are facing constrained resources, limiting timely treatment of patients as usual Patients with valvular heart disease are one of the most time sensitive patient populations, with delayed therapy possible leading to increased morbidity and mortality Identifying and allocating the available resources to the most vulnerable patients is crucial in providing optimal patient care with prioritization of essential surgical or percutaneous procedures for valvular heart disease Implementing telemedicine approaches might help to minimize nonessential physiciantopatient contact to ensure safety, for both patients and lastly but not least the treating physicians,Cardiovascular complications have been reported in patients with COVID19 We sought to examine the association of ABO blood group type with cardiovascular complications in COVID19xa0We examined 409 individuals enrolled in the COVID19 Registry to Assess Frequency, Management, and Outcomes of Arterial and Venous Thromboembolic Complications CORONAVTE who had ABO blood group data available Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the association of ABO blood group types with three primary outcomes major adverse cardiovascular events MACE, major arterial and venous thrombosis and allcause mortalityxa0201, 121, 61 and 26 individuals had blood group O, A, B and AB, respectively In multivariable analysis, blood group A was associated with a 25fold higher odds of MACE than blood group O OR 247118518 There was an effect suggesting a 2fold higher odds of major thrombotic events in blood group A vs O that did not reach statistical significance OR 215 089520 No association between blood group type and allcause mortality was found Compared with the other blood group types, blood group A was associated with an increased odds of MACEORAnonA 218111429, while blood group O was associated with lower odds of MACEOROnonO 050026097xa0In conclusion,xa0blood group A was associated with an increased odds of MACE, whereas blood group O was associated with a reduction in the odds of MACE in patients with COVID19 These findings may inform risk stratification of COVID19 patients for cardiovascular complications Additional studies are needed to validate our findings,Importance Artificial intelligence AI has been applied to analysis of medical imaging in recent years, but AI to guide the acquisition of ultrasonography images is a novel area of investigation A novel deeplearning DL algorithm, trained on more than 5 million examples of the outcome of ultrasonographic probe movement on image quality, can provide realtime prescriptive guidance for novice operators to obtain limited diagnostic transthoracic echocardiographic images Objective To test whether novice users could obtain 10view transthoracic echocardiographic studies of diagnostic quality using this DLbased software Design, Setting, and Participants This prospective, multicenter diagnostic study was conducted in 2 academic hospitals A cohort of 8 nurses who had not previously conducted echocardiograms was recruited and trained with AI Each nurse scanned 30 patients aged at least 18 years who were scheduled to undergo a clinically indicated echocardiogram at Northwestern Memorial Hospital or Minneapolis Heart Institute between March and May 2019 These scans were compared with those of sonographers using the same echocardiographic hardware but without AI guidance Interventions Each patient underwent paired limited echocardiograms one from a nurse without prior echocardiography experience using the DL algorithm and the other from a sonographer without the DL algorithm Five level 3trained echocardiographers independently and blindly evaluated each acquisition Main Outcomes and Measures Four primary end points were sequentially assessed qualitative judgement about left ventricular size and function, right ventricular size, and the presence of a pericardial effusion Secondary end points included 6 other clinical parameters and comparison of scans by nurses vs sonographers Results A total of 240 patients mean SD age, 61 16 years old 139 men 579 79 329 with body mass indexes 30 completed the study Eight nurses each scanned 30 patients using the DL algorithm, producing studies judged to be of diagnostic quality for left ventricular size, function, and pericardial effusion in 237 of 240 cases 988 and right ventricular size in 222 of 240 cases 925 For the secondary end points, nurse and sonographer scans were not significantly different for most parameters Conclusions and Relevance This DL algorithm allows novices without experience in ultrasonography to obtain diagnostic transthoracic echocardiographic studies for evaluation of left ventricular size and function, right ventricular size, and presence of a nontrivial pericardial effusion, expanding the reach of echocardiography to clinical settings in which immediate interrogation of anatomy and cardiac function is needed and settings with limited resources,We report the case of a patient critically ill with coronavirus disease2019 COVID19 in which atrial flutter with high ventricular response rate occurred, contributing to worsening of the respiratory distress After failure of noninvasive rate and rhythm control strategies, successful transcatheter ablation was performed and the respiratory distress of the patient improved Level of Difficulty Beginner,The current coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic represents a severe, lifechanging event for people across the world Life changes may involve job loss, income reduction due to furlough, death of a beloved one, or social stress due to life habit changes Many people suffer from social isolation due to lockdown or physical distancing, especially those living alone and without family This article reviews the association of life events and social isolation with cardiovascular disease, assembling the current state of knowledge for stroke and coronary heart disease Possible mechanisms underlying the links between life events, social isolation, and cardiovascular disease are outlined Furthermore, groups with increased vulnerability for cardiovascular disease following life events and social isolation are identified, and clinical implications of results are presented,Severe forms of COVID19 can evolve into pneumonia, featured by acute respiratory failure due to acute lung injury ALI and acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS In viral diseases, the replication of viruses is seemingly stimulated by an imbalance between prooxidant and antioxidant activity as well as by the deprivation of antioxidant mechanisms In COVID19 pneumonia, oxidative stress also appears to be highly detrimental to lung tissues Although inhaling ozone O3 gas has been shown to be toxic to the lungs, recent evidence suggests that its administration via appropriate routes and at small doses can paradoxically induce an adaptive reaction capable of decreasing the endogenous oxidative stress Ozone therapy is recommended to counter the disruptive effects of severe COVID19 on lung tissues, especially if administered in early stages of the disease, thereby preventing the progression to ARDS,This collaborative statement from the International Society for Holter and Noninvasive Electrocardiology Heart Rhythm Society European Heart Rhythm Association Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society describes the current status of mobile health mHealth technologies in arrhythmia management The range of digital medical tools and heart rhythm disorders that they may be applied to and clinical decisions that may be enabled are discussed The facilitation of comorbidity and lifestyle management increasingly recognized to play a role in heart rhythm disorders and patient selfmanagement are novel aspects of mHealth The promises of predictive analytics but also operational challenges in embedding mHealth into routine clinical care are explored,ObjectivesEnlarged main pulmonary artery diameter MPAD resulted to be associated with pulmonary hypertension and mortality in a nonCOVID19 setting The aim was to investigate and validate the association between MPAD enlargement and overall survival in COVID19 patientsMethodsThis is a cohort study on 1469 consecutive COVID19 patients submitted to chest CT within 72xa0h from admission in seven tertiary level hospitals in Northern Italy, between March 1 and April 20, 2020 Derivation cohort nu2009u2009761 included patients from the first three participating hospitals validation cohort nu2009u2009633 included patients from the remaining hospitals CT images were centrally analyzed in a corelab blinded to clinical data The prognostic value of MPAD on overall survival was evaluated at adjusted and multivariable Coxs regression analysis on the derivation cohort The final multivariable model was tested on the validation cohortResultsIn the derivation cohort, the median age was 69 IQR, 5877 years and 537 706 were males In the validation cohort, the median age was 69 IQR, 5977 years with 421 665 males Enlarged MPAD u200931xa0mm was a predictor of mortality at adjusted hazard ratio, HR 95CI 1741 12532418, p,Happy hypoxemia is an unspecified definition that is used in COVID19 patients to define hypoxemia without dyspnoea Dyspnoea is a very complex symptom, and although hypoxemia can cause breathlessness, dyspnoea is not related to hypoxemia, but is more closely related to inspiratory drive and mechanical alterations The lack of dyspnoea in the early stages of the disease is likely related to the absence of increased inspiratory drive due to compensatory mechanisms of hypoxemia, while in the advanced stages there is no evidence of a lack of dyspnoea in COVID19 patients,Abstract  Resident mesenchymal cells rMCs defined as Cd31 Neg Cd45 Neg Epcam Neg  control the selfrenewal and differentiation of alveolar epithelial type 2 AT2 stem cells in vitro The identity of these rMCs is still elusive Among them, Axin2 Pos mesenchymal alveolar niche cells MANCs, which are expressing Fgf7, have been previously described We propose that an additional population of rMCs, expressing Fgf10 called rMCSca1 Pos Fgf10 Pos  are equally important to maintain AT2 stem cell selfrenewal  The alveolosphere model, based on the AT2rMC coculture in growth factor reduced Matrigel, was used to test the efficiency of different rMC subpopulations isolated by FACS from adult murine lung to sustain the selfrenewal and differentiation of AT2 stem cells  We demonstrate that rMCSca1 Pos Fgf10 Pos cells are efficient to promote the selfrenewal and differentiation of AT2 stem cells Costaining of adult lung for Fgf10 mRNA and Sftpc protein respectively, indicate that 28 of Fgf10 Pos cells are located close to AT2 cells CoISH for Fgf7 and Fgf10 indicate that these two populations do not significantly overlap Gene arrays comparing rMCSca1 Pos Axin2 Pos and rMCSca1 Pos Fgf10 Pos support that these two cell subsets express differential markers In addition, rMC function is decreased in diabetic and obese obob mutant compared to WT mice with a much stronger loss of function in males compared to females   In conclusion, rMCSca1 Pos Fgf10 Pos cells play important role in supporting AT2 stem cells selfrenewal and differentiation This result sheds a new light on the subpopulations of rMCs contributing to the AT2 stem cell niche in homeostasis and in the context of COVID19 pathogenesis   Key message  What is already known about the subject  Resident mesenchymal cells rMCs defined as Cd31 Neg Cd45 Neg Epcam Neg  control the selfrenewal and differentiation of alveolar epithelial type 2 AT2 stem cells in vitro The identity of these rMCs is still elusive Among them, Axin2 Pos mesenchymal alveolar niche cells MANCs, which are expressing Fgf7, have been previously described    What does this study add  Our study shows that an additional population of rMCs, expressing Fgf10 called rMCSca1 Pos Fgf10 Pos  is equally important to maintain AT2 stem cell selfrenewal rMCSca1 Pos Fgf10 Pos are LipidTox High and are located close to AT2s In addition, rMCSca1 Pos Fgf10 Pos cells support AT2 stem cell selfrenewal and differentiation thereby identifying these cells as bone fide functional lipofibroblasts LIFs We have previously reported that LIF can transdifferentiate into activated MYF in the context of bleomycininduced fibrosis in mice 1 and that activated MYF isolated from the lungs of end stage idiopathic fibrosis human patients can respond to Metformin to undergo transdifferentiation back to the LIF phenotype 2 We also show that the function of rMCsSca1 Pos is negatively impacted by gender and obesity, which represent two major aggravating factors for COVID19 pathogenesis, leading to either death or major complications after infection recovery such as lung fibrosis    How might this impact on clinical practice and future development  By establishing that rMCSca1 Pos Fgf10 Pos are different from the MANCs, our study opens the way for a new key mesenchymal cell population that should be targeted to either prevent or reverse fibrosis In addition, as this population maintains the AT2 stem cells selfrenewal and differentiation, such targeting will also allow to progressively recover the loss in respiratory function,,,Sexual minority persons experience health disparities associated with sexual stigma and discrimination and have a high prevalence of several health conditions that have been associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 1,2 Current COVID19 surveillance systems do not capture information about sexual orientation To begin bridging the gap in knowledge about COVID19 risk among sexual minority adults, CDC examined disparities between sexual minority and heterosexual adults in the prevalence of underlying conditions with strong or mixed evidence of associations with severe COVID19related illness 3, by using data from the 20172019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System BRFSS When age, sex, and survey year are adjusted, sexual minority persons have higher prevalences than do heterosexual persons of selfreported cancer, kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD, heart disease including myocardial infarction, angina, or coronary heart disease, obesity, smoking, diabetes, asthma, hypertension, and stroke Sexual minority adults who are members of racialethnic minority groups disproportionately affected by the pandemic also have higher prevalences of several of these health conditions than do racialethnic minority adults who are heterosexual Collecting data on sexual orientation in COVID19 surveillance and other studies would improve knowledge about disparities in infection and adverse outcomes by sexual orientation, thereby informing more equitable responses to the pandemic,The worldwide novel coronavirus SARSCoV‑2 pandemic is ongoing SARSCoV‑2 belongs to the coronavirus family, the first representatives of which have been known since the 1960s Coronaviruses are present in animals and humans and show similarities as well as differences in their biology and pathology regarding each genus Besides mild flulike and gastroenterological symptoms, SARSCoV‑2 can lead to dysfunctions of the lungs and other organs including the heart as already observed during SARS and MERS infections,The lymphatic vasculature has an essential role in maintaining normal fluid balance in tissues and modulating the inflammatory response to injury or pathogens Disruption of normal development or function of lymphatic vessels can have severe consequences In the heart, reduced lymphatic function can lead to myocardial oedema and persistent inflammation Macrophages, which are phagocytic cells of the innate immune system, contribute to cardiac development and to fibrotic repair and regeneration of cardiac tissue after myocardial infarction In this Review, we discuss the cardiac lymphatic vasculature with a focus on developments over the past 5 years arising from the study of mammalian and zebrafish model organisms In addition, we examine the interplay between the cardiac lymphatics and macrophages during fibrotic repair and regeneration after myocardial infarction Finally, we discuss the therapeutic potential of targeting the cardiac lymphatic network to regulate immune cell content and alleviate inflammation in patients with ischaemic heart disease,BackgroundSevere coronavirus disease19 COVID19 presents with progressive dyspnea, which results from acute lung inflammatory edema leading to hypoxia As with other infectious diseases that affect the respiratory tract, asthma has been cited as a potential risk factor for severe COVID19 However, conflicting results have been published over the last few months and the putative association between these two diseases is still unprovenMethodsHere, we systematically reviewed all reports on COVID19 published since its emergence in December 2019 to June 30, 2020, looking into the description of asthma as a premorbid condition, which could indicate its potential involvement in disease progressionResultsWe found 372 articles describing the underlying diseases of 161,271 patients diagnosed with COVID19 Asthma was reported as a premorbid condition in only 2623 patients accounting for 16 of all patientsConclusionsAs the global prevalence of asthma is 44, we conclude that either asthma is not a premorbid condition that contributes to the development of COVID19 or clinicians and researchers are not accurately describing the premorbidities in COVID19 patients,Pulmonary fibrosis has been identified as a main factor leading to pulmonary dysfunction and poor quality of life in postrecovery Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome SARS survivors consequent to SARSCov2 infection Thus there is an urgent medical need for identification of readily available biomarkers that in patients with SARSCov2 infection are able to 1 identify patients in most need of medical care prior to admittance to an intensive care unit ICU, and 2 identify patients postinfection at risk of developing persistent fibrosis of lungs with subsequent impaired quality of life and increased morbidity and mortality An intense amount of research have focused on wound healing and Extracellular Matrix ECM remodelling of the lungs related to lung function decline in pulmonary fibrosis PF A range of noninvasive serological biomarkers, reflecting tissue remodelling, and fibrosis have been shown to predict risk of acute exacerbations, lung function decline and mortality in PF and other interstitial lung diseases Sand et al in Respir Res 1982, 2018 We suggest that lessons learned from such PF studies of the pathological processes leading to lung function decline could be used to better identify patients infected with SARSCoV2 at most risk of acute deterioration or persistent fibrotic damage of the lung and could consequently be used to guide treatment decisions,,Behcet syndrome is a rare vasculitis that affects both arteries and veins VasculoBechet Syndrome VBS is seen predominantly in men Genetic predisposition and immune dysregulation leading to inflammation, endothelial damage, and impaired fibrinolysis contribute to its pathogenesis Isolated case reports of Behcet syndrome BS with associated acute coronary syndrome ACS have been reported in the past In this study, we present the first systematic review of such cases A systematic search was conducted using Pubmed, Google Scholar, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Web of Science databases from 19802018 to identify case reports of myocardial infarction associated with BS Cases that fulfilled the criteria for BS were selected for analysis Demographic data, electrocardiography, echocardiography, angiography findings, and management were analyzed when available We identified 62 case reports Most subjects were men with a mean age of 37 years Twentyone percent were smokers, but other traditional cardiovascular risk factors were less common Myocardial infarction was confirmed in half of the cases with findings on electrocardiogram ECG Echocardiogram revealed wall motion abnormality in 76 of patients, and angiography showed doublevessel disease in more than half of the cases Mortality was reported in 16 of the cases This systematic review shows that ACS in BS affects young males with low prevalence of coronary artery disease risk factors Chest pain is the most common presenting feature and STsegment elevation myocardial infarction STEMI was the most common ECG finding Immunotherapy may be helpful to prevent future ACS in these patients,,BACKGROUND The coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 has caused a new global pandemic and is responsible for millions of infections and thousands of deaths in the world The lung ultrasound LUS is a noninvasive and easily repeatable tool and can be carried out by the pediatrician at the bedside of children with a consequent reduction in the risk of transmission of the virus OBJECTIVE We hypothesized that ultrasound findings in these patients would 1 be associated with their disease severity and 2 change over time in alignment with clinical outcome METHODS The study was made in the emergency department ED in a tertiary level pediatric hospital All patients with swabconfirmed COVID19 infection were subjected to a LUS within 6u2009h from admission and after 96u2009h RESULTS Among a total of 30 children, 18 60 were males, 4 reported exertional dyspnea, and only 1 chest pain The mean oxygen saturation was 988u2009u200910 in ambient air in the ED and no patient needed oxygen therapy during hospitalization Children with moderate disease presented more B line pu2009u200903 After 96u2009h, we had observed ultrasound abnormality only in 20 of the children We found a statistically significant reduction in pleural irregularities 30 vs 167 pu2009u2009001 and in B lines 50 vs 20 pu2009u2009008 CONCLUSIONS The LUSxa0is a useful, feasible, and safe tool for the clinician to complement the clinical evaluation and to monitor the evolution of lung disease in children with COVID19,BackgroundIn late December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases due to a novel betacoronavirus, SARSCoV2 was reported in China The socalled COVID 19 is responsible not only for respiratory symptoms, from mild up to pneumonia and even acute respiratory distress syndrome, but also for extrapulmonary involvementCases presentationHere we present two cases of spontaneous muscle hematoma in patients with SARSCoV2 infection, both on therapeutic LMWH for atrial fibrillation the first one was an 86yearold Caucasian female with a history of hypertensive cardiomyopathy and the second one was an 81yearold Caucasian male with a history of hypertension, diabetes and ischemic heart disease Blood tests revealed a considerable drop of hemoglobin and alterations of coagulation system In both cases, embolization of femoral artery was performed A few other cases of bleeding manifestations are reported in literature, while a lot has been published about the hypercoagulability related to COVID19ConclusionsOur reports and literature review highlight the need of active surveillance for possible hemorrhagic complications in patients with SARSCoV2 infection,Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID19, caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2, has affected over 30 million globally to date Although high rates of venous thromboembolism and evidence of COVID19induced endothelial dysfunction have been reported, the precise aetiology of the increased thrombotic risk associated with COVID19 infection remains to be fully elucidated Therefore, we assessed clinical platelet parameters and circulating platelet activity in patients with severe and nonsevere COVID19 An assessment of clinical blood parameters in patients with severe COVID19 disease requiring intensive care, patients with nonsevere disease not requiring intensive care, general medical inpatients without COVID19, and healthy donors was undertaken Platelet function and activity were also assessed by secretion and specific marker analysis We demonstrated that routine clinical blood parameters including increased mean platelet volume MPV and decreased plateletneutrophil ratio are associated with disease severity in COVID19 upon hospitalisation and intensive care unit ICU admission Strikingly, agonistinduced ADP release was 30 to 90fold higher in COVID19 patients compared with hospitalised controls and circulating levels of platelet factor 4 PF4, soluble Pselectin sPselectin, and thrombopoietin TPO were also significantly elevated in COVID19 This study shows that distinct differences exist in routine full blood count and other clinical laboratory parameters between patients with severe and nonsevere COVID19 Moreover, we have determined all COVID19 patients possess hyperactive circulating platelets These data suggest abnormal platelet reactivity may contribute to hypercoagulability in COVID19 and confirms the role that plateletsclotting has in determining the severity of the disease and the complexity of the recovery path,We present a case of a 38yearold man with a history of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension on therapeutic anticoagulation and recent hospitalisation for COVID19 disease who was hospitalised for recurrent acute pulmonary embolism despite therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin International Normalized Ratio INR of 30 Our case highlights the hypercoagulable state associated with COVID19 disease and the absence of standardised approaches to anticoagulation treatment for this population,STUDY OBJECTIVES In the context of the current COVID19 pandemic situation, we address the following important questions 1 How can patients be identified for possible OSA while sleep clinic testing is temporarily unavailable or limited and 2 What measures can be suggested to improve sleep health until proper diagnosis and treatment become safe and available again METHODS As a proxy for home or inlaboratory testing, validation of a symptombased measure of OSA risk is presented, based on an ongoing larger prospective study of 156 family medicine patients with OSA 88 women, 68 men mean age, 57 years and 60 control participants 36 women, 24 men mean age, 54 years recruited from the community Participants completed the Sleep Symptom Checklist SSC and a range of other selfreport measures primary care patients also underwent a polysomnographic sleep study RESULTS Results showed that 1 individuals with OSA reported more symptoms on the SSC related to insomnia, daytime symptoms, sleep disorders, and psychological maladjustment than did the control group all P  001, and 2 their sleeprelated symptoms were significantly more severe than those of the control patients In addition, several polysomnographic indices in recently diagnosed untreated individuals with OSA were significantly correlated with SSC measured sleep disorder symptoms, and SSC scores significantly distinguished participants with OSA from control participants CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that family practitioners can effectively prescreen patients for possible OSA by inquiring about 5 items that form the SSC sleep disorders subscale If OSA is suspected, then we can recommend a range of behavioral techniques to improve symptoms The current pandemic causes us to reflect that the provisional targeting of symptoms and guidance regarding mitigation strategies while waiting for specialist care could serve patients well at any time,The aim of our study was to elucidate if SARSCoV2 viral load on admission, measured by realtime reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction rRTPCR cycle threshold Ct value on nasopharyngeal samples, was a marker of disease severity All hospitalized adult patients with a diagnosis of SARSCoV2 infection by rRTPCR performed on a nasopharingeal sample from March 1 to March 18 in our institution were included The study population was divided according to the Ct value obtained upon admission in patients with high viral load Ct u200930 Demographic, clinical and laboratory variables of the different groups were analyzed to assess the influence of viral load on the development of respiratory failure during admission Overall, 455 sequential patients were included The median Ct value was 28 IQR 2432 One hundred and thirty patients 286 had a high viral load, 175 385 an intermediate viral load and 150 33 a low viral load Advanced age, male sex, presence of cardiovascular disease and laboratory markers such as lactate dehydrogenase, lymphocyte count and Creactive protein, as well as a high viral load on admission, were predictive of respiratory failure A Ct value,Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 was rapidly expanded worldwide within a short period Its relationship with chronic comorbidities is still unclear We aimed to determine the effects of chronic comorbidities on clinical outcomes of patients with and without COVID19 This was an analysis of 65,535 patients with suspicion of viral respiratory disease 38,324 SARSCoV2 positive and 27,211 SARSCoV2 negative from January 01 to May 12, 2020 using the national administrative healthcare open data of Mexico SARSCoV2 infection was confirmed by reversetranscriptasepolymerasechainreaction General characteristics and chronic comorbidities were explored Clinical outcomes of interest were hospital admission, pneumonia, intensive care unit admission, endotracheal intubation and mortality Prevalence of chronic comorbidities was 494 Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the effect of age, male sex, bronchial asthma, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease on clinical outcomes was similar for both SARSCoV2 positive and negative patients Adverse clinical outcomes were associated with the time from symptoms onset to medical contact, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension and obesity in SARSCoV2 positive patients, but with cardiovascular disease in SARSCoV2 negative patients p value,BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Acute ischemic stroke may occur in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19, but risk factors, inhospital events, and outcomes are not well studied in large cohorts We identified risk factors, comorbidities, and outcomes in patients with COVID19 with or without acute ischemic stroke and compared with patients without COVID19 and acute ischemic stroke METHODS We analyzed the data from 54 health care facilities using the Cerner deidentified COVID19 dataset The dataset included patients with an emergency department or inpatient encounter with discharge diagnoses codes that could be associated to suspicion of or exposure to COVID19 or confirmed COVID19 RESULTS A total of 103 13 patients developed acute ischemic stroke among 8163 patients with COVID19 Among all patients with COVID19, the proportion of patients with hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure was significantly higher among those with acute ischemic stroke Acute ischemic stroke was associated with discharge to destination other than home or death relative risk, 21 95 CI, 1624 P00001 after adjusting for potential confounders A total of 199 10 patients developed acute ischemic stroke among 19u2009513 patients without COVID19 Among all ischemic stroke patients, COVID19 was associated with discharge to destination other than home or death relative risk, 12 95 CI, 1013 P003 after adjusting for potential confounders CONCLUSIONS Acute ischemic stroke was infrequent in patients with COVID19 and usually occurs in the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors The risk of discharge to destination other than home or death increased 2fold with occurrence of acute ischemic stroke in patients with COVID19,,,,Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein MOG immunoglobulin G IgGassociated disease MOGAD is increasingly recognized as a distinct nosological entity from aquaporin‐4 antibody IgGpositive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder AQP4‐IgG NMOSD The advent of highly specific MOG‐IgG cell‐based diagnostic assays have helped to refine our understanding of the clinical spectrum of MOGAD To date, treatment approaches have been largely extrapolated from AQP4‐IgG NMOSD experience, but there is growing evidence of distinct differences in treatment response between these conditions This review summarizes the current status and understanding of acute and chronic treatments for MOGAD Timing and duration of treatment, pregnancy, and emerging therapies are also discussed This review summarizes the current understanding of acute and chronic treatments for MOGAD Timing and duration of treatment, pregnancy, and emerging therapies are also discussed,SARSCoV2 induced lower respiratory tract LRT disease can deteriorate to acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS Because the release of neutrophil extracellular traps NETs is implicated in ARDS pathogenesis, we investigated the presence of NETs and correlates of pathogenesis in blood and LRT samples of critically ill COVID19 patients Plasma NET levels peaked early after ICU admission and correlated with SARSCoV2 RNA load in sputum and levels of neutrophilrecruiting chemokines and inflammatory markers in plasma Baseline plasma NET quantity correlated with disease severity, but was not associated with soluble markers of thrombosis nor with development of thrombosis High NET levels were present in LRT samples and persisted during the course of COVID19, consistent with the detection of NETs in bronchi and alveolar spaces in lung tissue from fatal COVID19 patients Thus, NETs are produced and retained in the LRT of critical COVID19 patients and could contribute to SARSCoV2induced ARDS pathology u2003,,Heart failure HF is a major public health problem and a leading cause of hospitalization in western countries Over the past decades, the goal has been to find the best method for monitoring congestive symptoms to prevent hospitalizations Addressing this task through regular physician visits, blood tests, and imaging has proven insufficient for optimal control and has not decreased enough HFrelated hospitalization rates In recent years, new devices have been developed for this reason and CardioMEMS is one of the therapeutic monitoring options CardioMEMS has shown to be effective in preventing and reducing HF hospitalizations in patients both with HF with reduced ejection fraction and HF with preserved ejection fraction CardioMEMS versatility has made it a great option for pulmonary artery pressure monitoring, both during the coronavirus disease19 COVID19 pandemic and when the clinic visits have partially resumed CardioMEMS is the remote haemodynamic monitoring system with the most evidencedriven efficacy, and COVID19 has put it in the spot as a centrestage technology for HF monitoring In a few months of the COVID19 epidemic, CardioMEMS has grown to maturity, making it the new normal for highquality, highvalue remote HF care,Acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS occurred in 12 of hospitalized COVID19 patients in a recent New York City cohort Pulmonary endothelial dysfunction, characterized by increased expression of inflammatory genes and increased monolayer permeability, is a major component of ARDS Vascular leak results in parenchymal accumulation of leukocytes, protein, and extravascular water, leading to pulmonary edema, ischemia, and activation of coagulation associated with COVID19 Endothelial inflammation further contributes to uncontrolled cytokine storm in ARDS We have recently demonstrated that Kruppellike factor 2 KLF2, a transcription factor which promotes endothelial quiescence and monolayer integrity, is significantly reduced in experimental models of ARDS Lung inflammation and hightidal volume ventilation result in reduced KLF2, leading to pulmonary endothelial dysfunction and acute lung injury Mechanistically, we found that KLF2 is a potent transcriptional activator of Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor 3 RAPGEF3 which orchestrates and maintains vascular integrity Moreover, KLF2 regulates multiple genomewide association study GWASimplicated ARDS genes Whether lung KLF2 is regulated by SARSCoV2 infection is unknown Here we report that endothelial KLF2 is significantly reduced in human lung autopsies from COVID19 patients, which supports that ARDS due to SARSCoV2 is a vascular phenotype possibly attributed to KLF2 downregulation We provide additional data demonstrating that KLF2 is downregulated in SARSCoV infection in mice,Approximately 155 million cancer survivors were alive in the United States in 2016 with expected growth to 261 million by 2040 1 Cancer survivors are living longer because of advances in early detection and treatment, but face psychosocial, cognitive, financial, and physical challenges 1,2 Physical challenges include cardiovascular complications, partly because cancer and cardiovascular disease CVD share some cumulative risk factors including tobacco use, physical inactivity, obesity, poor diet, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia 3 In addition, many cancer treatments damage the heart, and some cancer types increase risk for developing CVD 4 The recognition and management of heart disease in cancer survivors has given rise to the discipline of cardiooncology, which focuses on the cardiovascular health of this population 5 CVD risk has been previously estimated using prediction models, and studies suggest that physicianpatient communication using predicted heart age rather than predicted 10year risk has led to a more accurate perception of excess heart age, encouraged actions to adopt a healthy lifestyle, and improved modifiable CVD risk factors 6,7 Using the nonlaboratorybased Framingham Risk Score FRS to estimate 10year risk for developing CVD, predicted heart age is estimated from the 10year risk of CVD predicted by age, sex, diabetes status, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, hypertension treatment status, and body mass index it is the age of an otherwise healthy person with the same predicted risk, with all other risk factors included in the prediction model at the normal level systolic blood pressure of 125 mmHg, no hypertension treatment, body mass index of 225, nonsmoker, and nondiabetic 6 Using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System BRFSS, this study estimates predicted heart age, excess heart age difference between predicted heart age and actual age, and racialethnic and sociodemographic disparities in predicted heart age among US adult cancer survivors and noncancer participants aged 3074 years using previously published methods 7 A total of 22,759 men and 46,294 women were cancer survivors with a mean age of 487 and 483 years, respectively The predicted heart age and excess heart age among cancer survivors were 572 and 85 years, respectively, for men and 548 and 65 years, respectively, for women, and varied by age, raceethnicity, education and income The use of predicted heart age by physicians to encourage cancer survivors to improve modifiable risk factors and make heart healthy choices, such as tobacco cessation, regular physical activity, and a healthy diet to maintain a healthy weight, can engage survivors in informed cancer care planning after diagnosis,Coronavirus disease 2019 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 Primarily an infection of the lower respiratory tract, it is now well known to cause multisystem abnormalities Hematologic manifestations constitute a significant area of concern Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infects monocytes and endothelial cells leading to a complex downstream cascade, cytokine storm, and eventual intravascular thrombosis Coronavirus disease 2019 causes lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and thrombocytopenia Prophylactic anticoagulation is vital in patients with coronavirus disease 2019, as its effect on the coagulation system is associated with significant morbidity and mortality The disease can cause both arterial and venous thromboses, especially pulmonary embolism and pulmonary microthrombi A high index of suspicion is indispensable in recognizing these complications, and timely institution of therapeutic anticoagulation is vital in treating them Virusinduced disseminated intravascular coagulation is uncommon but shares some similarities to sepsisinduced disseminated intravascular coagulation Marked elevations in hematologic biomarkers such as lactate dehydrogenase, Ddimer, ferritin, and Creactive protein are associated with worse outcomes Understanding the pathophysiology and recognizing factors associated with poor prognosis are crucial in improving patient outcomes with coronavirus disease 2019,Abstract Coagulopathy and inflammation are hallmarks of Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 and are associated with increased mortality The mechanisms that drive thromboinflammation in COVID19 are poorly understood Here, we report a role of the NETs Factor XII FXII axis for initiating procoagulant and proinflammatory reactions in COVID19  Proteomic analysis revealed enrichment of FXII in postmortem lung tissue from COVID19 patients Immunofluorescence analysis of COVID19 lung tissue showed that FXII is activated in the lung parenchyma, within the pulmonary vessel walls and in fibrinrich alveolar spaces In particular, activated FXII FXIIa colocalized with NETs in COVID19 lung tissue, indicating that NETs accumulation leads to FXII contact activation in COVID19 We further showed that an accumulation of NETs is partially caused by impaired NETs clearance via extracellular DNases In contrast, addition of DNase I improved NETs clearance and reduced FXII activation in vitro We propose that targeting both, FXIIa and the FXII activator NETs, is therapeutically effective in mitigating thromboinflammation in COVID19,,,,,Background and Aims Angiotensinconverting enzyme II ACE2 is the key molecule for understanding the pathophysiology of COVID19 The risk of COVID19 and impact of immunosuppressive treatment on disease course in patients with inflammatory bowel disease IBD remain controversial We aimed to determine the change of intestinal ACE2 expression before and after biologics treatment including antitumor necrosis factor α antiTNFα, antiintegrin, and antiinterleukin IL1223 in IBD patients Methods We analyzed the ACE2 expression through the public database of paired intestinal biopsies from IBD patients before and after biologic therapy Change of ACE2 RNA and protein expression were validated in two independent cohorts Birmingham cohort and Guangzhou cohort The correlation between ACE2 expression and disease activity was also analyzed Results Mining information from the GEO database showed that compared with healthy control, intestinal ACE2 expression was downregulated in ileum of CD patients, while upregulated in colon of both CD and UC patients Colonic ACE2 RNA expression was decreased significantly in patients responding to antiTNFα but not antiintegrin and antiIL1223, which was validated in the Birmingham cohort Using the Guangzhou cohort including 53 patients matched by pre and postantiTNFα therapy, colonic ACE2 protein expression was significantly downregulated after antiTNFα treatment in responders P  0001 rather than nonresponders Colonic ACE2 expression was significantly higher in patients with severe histologically active disease compared with those with moderate P  00001 and mild P  00002 histologically active disease Conclusion Intestinal inflammation influences the expression of intestinal ACE2 in IBD patients, with different alterations in the ileum and colon Colonic ACE2 expression was downregulated after antiTNFα therapy in IBD patients responding to treatment This might provide new clues regarding the risk of SARSCoV2 infection and the potential benefit of sustaining antiTNFα treatment in patients with IBD,OBJECTIVES Recent evidence has shown no harm associated with the use of angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors ACEIs or angiotensinreceptor blockers ARBs in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 We sought to further clarify the possible association between ACEIARB use and the risk of poor clinical outcomes of COVID19 METHODS From the completely enumerated COVID19 cohort in Korea, we identified 1,290 patients with hypertension, of whom 682 had and 603 did not have records of ACEIARB use during the 30day period before their COVID19 diagnosis Our primary endpoint comprised clinical outcomes, including allcause mortality, use of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission, and sepsis We used inverse probability of treatment weighting IPTW to mitigate selection bias, and a Poisson regression model to estimate the relative risks RRs and 95 confidence intervals CIs for comparing outcomes between ACEIARB users and nonusers RESULTS Compared to nonuse, ACEIARB use was associated with lower clinical outcomes IPTWadjusted RR, 060 95 CI, 042 to 085 p0005 For individual outcomes, ACEIARB use was not associated with allcause mortality IPTWadjusted RR, 062 95 CI, 035 to 109 p0097 or respiratory events IPTWadjusted RR, 099 95 CI, 084 to 117 p0904 Subgroup analysis showed a trend toward a protective role of ACEIs and ARBs against overall outcomes in men IPTWadjusted RR, 084 95 CI, 069 to 103 pinteraction0008 and patients with preexisting respiratory disease IPTWadjusted RR, 074 95 CI, 060 to 092 pinteraction0002 CONCLUSIONS We present clinical evidence to support continuing ACEARB use in COVID19 patients with hypertension based on the completely enumerated Korean cohort,Importance Severe coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is characterized by the intense formation of neutrophil extracellular traps NETs, leading to the occlusion of microvessels, as shown in pulmonary samples The occurrence of STelevated myocardial infarction STEMI is a serious cardiac manifestation of COVID19 the intrinsic mechanism of coronary thrombosis appears to still be unknown Objective To determine the role of NETs in coronary thrombosis in patients with COVID19 Design, Setting, and Participants This was a consecutive series of patients with COVID19 at an academic tertiary hospital in Madrid, Spain, who underwent primary coronary interventions for STEMI in which coronary aspirates were obtained in the catheterization laboratory using a thrombus aspiration device Patients with COVID19 who experienced a STEMI between March 23 and April 11, 2020, from whom coronary thrombus samples were aspirated during primary coronary intervention, were included in the analysis These patients were compared with a series conducted from July 2015 to December 2015 of patients with STEMI Main Outcomes and Measures The presence and quantity of NETs in coronary aspirates from patients with STEMI and COVID19 The method for the analysis of NETs in paraffinembedded coronary thrombi was based on the use of confocal microscopy technology and image analysis for the colocalization of myeloperoxidaseDNA complexes and citrullinated histone H3 Immunohistochemical analysis of thrombi was also performed Clinical and angiographic variables were prospectively collected Results Five patients with COVID19 were included 4 men 80 mean SD age, 62 14 years the comparison group included 50 patients 44 males 88 mean SD age, 58 12 years NETs were detected in the samples of all 5 patients with COVID19, and the median density of NETs was 61 95 CI, 4391 In the historical series of patients with STEMI, NETs were found in 34 of 50 thrombi 68, and the median NET density was 19 95 CI, 1322 P,The authors hypothesized that the cytokine storm described in COVID19 patients may lead to consistent cellbased tissue factor TFmediated activation of coagulation, procoagulant microvesicles MVs release, and massive platelet activation COVID19 patients have higher levels of TF platelets, TF granulocytes, and TF MVs than healthy subjects and coronary artery disease patients Plasma MVassociated thrombin generation is present in prophylactic anticoagulated patients A sustained platelet activation in terms of Pselectin expression and plateletleukocyte aggregate formation, and altered nitric oxideprostacyclin synthesis are also observed COVID19 plasma, added to the blood of healthy subjects, induces platelet activation similar to that observed inxa0vivo This effect was blunted by preincubation with tocilizumab, aspirin, or a P2Y12 inhibitor,The World Health Organization declared the 2019 coronavirus COVID19 a global pandemic on March 12, 2020 However, inadequate attention seems to have been paid to the heart when managing COVID19 in terms of detection, monitoring and treatment We are of the opinion that these severe patients may have had myocardial injury or acute myocarditis Signs that supports this opinion is the extremely high myocardial injury markers in severe patients, cardiac arrhythmia and suffer progressive heart failure or unexpected cardiac arrest in recent studies Some suggestions involved of treatment need to be made The use of an intraaortic balloon pump IABP plus extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ECMO should be placed earlier if the pneumonia progresses rapidly, the ejection fraction decreases or there is heart failure Besides, blood purification treatment including continuous kidney substitution treatment CRRT is recommended to clear inflammatory factors and block cytokine storm In addition, the early usage of glucocorticoid and human immunoglobulin has been found to be preferable when acute myocarditis is accompanied by unstable hemodynamics,Aim  To determine the predictive role of estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure ePASP in COVID19 patients   Material and methods  A retrospective study of inpatients with documented COVID19 infection was carried out Maximal followup period was 63 days The study included 108 patients men, 62 women, 46 mean age, 62,915,5 years At admission, mean NEWS score was 6,0, blood oxygen saturation — 92 Echocardiography was performed according to standard protocol using Vivid E9 ultrasound system GE Healthcare Quantitative measurements were performed according to the current ASE and EACVI guidelines Statistical analysis was performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics v26 software developed by IBM Corporation   Results Using the CHAID technique, a classification tree was developed and the strongest predictor of an unfavorable outcome was determined ePASP Threshold ePASP values, associated with an increased mortality risk were established 42 mm Hg and 50 mm Hg Three groups of patients were selected based on the main predictor 41,0 mm Hg, 4249 mm Hg and 50 mm Hg The increased mortality risk was noted in groups 2 and 3 compared to group 1 of patients and amounted to 31,8 and 70 versus 3,9, respectively There was also a correlation between the severity of CT lung parenchymal lesions according to computed tomography and the study groups of patients 36 3049 — group 1, 50 3676 — group 2, and 84 5692 — group 3, p0,001 In groups 2 and 3, the following complications were significantly more frequent acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute heart failure, multiple organ system failure, venous thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation In group 3, acute renal failure and systemic inflammatory response syndrome developed significantly more often than in group 1   Conclusion A comprehensive echocardiography has proven its availability and safety in assessing the condition of COVID19 patients, allowing to obtain relevant information on pulmonary hemodynamics Transthoracic echocardiography reduced the risk of complications from invasive diagnostic methods and allowed to abandon the use of the SwanGanz pulmonary artery catheter in the studied group of patients As a result, a relationship was noted between the increase of ePASP and the severity of clinical performance and lung tissue damage according to computed tomography, changes in laboratory blood tests, the severity of the comorbid profile, an increase in respiratory support need,BACKGROUND On 13 March 2020, the Danish authorities imposed extensive nationwide lockdown measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 and reallocated limited healthcare resources We investigated mortality rates, overall and according to location, in patients with established cardiovascular disease before, during, and after these lockdown measures METHODS AND RESULTS Using Danish nationwide registries, we identified a dynamic cohort comprising all Danish citizens with cardiovascular disease ie a history of ischaemic heart disease, ischaemic stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, or peripheral artery disease alive on 2 January 2019 and 2020 The cohort was followed from 2 January 20192020 until death or 1615 October 20192020 The cohort comprised 340 392 and 347 136 patients with cardiovascular disease in 2019 and 2020, respectively The overall, inhospital, and outofhospital mortality rate in 2020 before lockdown was significantly lower compared with the same period in 2019 adjusted incidence rate ratio IRR 091, 95 confidence interval CI CI 087095 IRR 095, 95 CI 089102 and IRR 087, 95 CI 083093, respectively The overall mortality rate during and after lockdown was not significantly different compared with the same period in 2019 IRR 099, 95 CI 097102 However, the inhospital mortality rate was lower and outofhospital mortality rate higher during and after lockdown compared with the same period in 2019 inhospital, IRR 092, 95 CI 088096 outofhospital, IRR 104, 95 CI101108 These trends were consistent irrespective of sex and age CONCLUSIONS Among patients with established cardiovascular disease, the inhospital mortality rate was lower and outofhospital mortality rate higher during lockdown compared with the same period in the preceding year, irrespective of age and sex,,RATIONALE The natural history of recovery from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 remains unknown Since fibrosis with persistent physiological deficit is a previouslydescribed feature of patients recovering from similar coronaviruses, treatment represents an early opportunity to modify the disease course, potentially preventing irreversible impairment OBJECTIVES Determine the incidence of and describe the progression of persistent inflammatory interstitial lung disease ILD following SARSCoV2 when treated with prednisolone METHODS A structured assessment protocol screened for sequelae of SARSCoV2 pneumonitis 837 patients were assessed by telephone four weeks after discharge Those with ongoing symptoms had outpatient assessment at six weeks Thirty patients diagnosed with persistent interstitial lung changes at multidisciplinary team meeting were reviewed in the interstitial lung disease service and offered treatment These patients had persistent, nonimproving symptoms RESULTS At four weeks postdischarge, 39 of patients reported ongoing symptoms 325837, and were assessed Interstitial lung disease, predominantly organising pneumonia, with significant functional deficit was observed in 35837 survivors 48 Thirty of these patients received steroid treatment, resulting in a mean relative increase in transfer factor following treatment of 316 standard deviation  2764, p 0001, and FVC of 96 standard deviation  1301, p  0014, with significant symptomatic and radiological improvement CONCLUSION Following SARSCoV2 pneumonitis, a cohort of patients are left with both radiological inflammatory lung disease and persistent physiological and functional deficit Early treatment with corticosteroids was well tolerated and associated with rapid and significant improvement This preliminary data should inform further study into the natural history and potential treatment for patients with persistent inflammatory ILD following SARSCoV2 infection,BACKGROUND Neuroinvasive properties of SARSCoV2 have allowed the hypothesis of several pathogenic mechanisms related to acute and chronic neurological sequelae However, neuropathological correlates have been poorly systematically investigated, being retrieved from reports of single case or limited case series still METHODS A PubMed search was carried out to review all publications on autopsy in subjects with COronaVIrus Disease19 COVID19 Among them, we focused on histological findings of the brain, which were compared with those from the authors autoptic studies performed in some COVID19 patients RESULTS Only seven studies reported histological evidence of brain pathology in patients deceased for COVID19, including three with reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction evidence of viral infection All these studies, in line with our experience, showed vascularrelated and infectionrelated secondary inflammatory tissue damage due to an abnormal immune response It is still unclear, however, whether these findings are the effect of a direct viral pathology or rather reflect a nonspecific consequence of cardiovascular and pulmonary disease on the brain CONCLUSIONS Notwithstanding the limited evidence available and the heterogeneity of the studies, we provide a preliminary description of the relationship between SARSCoV2 and brain sequelae Systematic autoptic investigations are needed for accurate detection and adequate management of these patients,,The COVID19 death toll has involved to date more than 1 million confirmed deaths The death rate is even higher in the obese COVID19 patients, as a result of hypoxia, due to the interplay between adipose tissue hypoxia and obstructive sleep apnea The discrepancy of manifestations seen in COVID19 seems to be mediated by a differential immune response rather than a differential viral load One of the key players of the immune response is HIF HIF1β is a stable constitutively expressed protein in the nucleus and under hypoxic changes, its activity is unaffected, whereas the HIFα subunit has a short halflife and because of its degradation by an enzyme known as propyl hydroxylase under hypoxic conditions, propyl hydroxylase gets deactivated thus leading to the stabilization of HIF1α As mentioned before, HIF1α expression is triggered by hypoxic states, this crippling condition will aggravate the proinflammatory characteristics of HIF1α The vast majority of decompensated COVID19 cases manifest with drastic lung injury and severe viral pneumonia, the infectioninduced hypoxia will the existing hypoxia in obesity This will additionally augment HIF1α levels that will provoke the already existing cytokines storm to fulminant Consequently, this will directly correlate the effect of a hypoxic environment with the increase of HIF1α level HIFɑ exists in two main isoforms HIF1α and HIF2α HIF1α and HIF2α act in distinct ways in how they work on different target genes For example, HIF2α may act on hemopoietin genes hemeregulating genes while HIF1α acts on EPO HIF1α release seems to be markedly augmented in obesity due to adipose tissue hypoxia and obstructive sleep apnea resulting in cyclic hypoxia HIF1α can also be secreted by direct viral proteolytic effects Whereas, HIF2α is stimulated by chronic hypoxia HIF1α exerts detrimental effects on the immune system, characterized by unopposed proinflammation at the macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, and complement levels resulting in cytokines storm, which is linked to the poor outcomes of COVID19 On the other hand, HIF2α role is regulatory and largely opposes the actions mediated by HIF1α In view of this, inhibiting HIF1α release or switching its production to HIF2α by natural products such as resveratrol or by synthetic drugs, offer a good therapeutic strategy that can prevent COVID19 worst outcome in infected patients The approach of breaking the vicious circle between lung damageinduced hypoxia and HIF1α proinflammatory stimulant through drugs is considered to be extremely promising as a therapeutic manner to combat further deterioration of COVID19 cases,,Hyperinflammation contributes to lung injury and subsequent acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS with high mortality in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 To understand the underlying mechanisms involved in lung pathology, we investigated the role of the lungspecific immune response We profiled immune cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and blood collected from COVID19 patients with severe disease and bacterial pneumonia patients not associated with viral infection By tracking T cell clones across tissues, we identified clonally expanded tissueresident memorylike Th17 cells Trm17 cells in the lungs even after viral clearance These Trm17 cells were characterized by a a potentially pathogenic cytokine expression profile of IL17A and CSF2 GMCSF Interactome analysis suggests that Trm17 cells can interact with lung macrophages and cytotoxic CD8 T cells, which have been associated with disease severity and lung damage High IL17A and GMCSF protein levels in the serum of COVID19 patients were associated with a more severe clinical course Collectively, our study suggests that pulmonary Trm17 cells are one potential orchestrator of the hyperinflammation in severe COVID19,,The patientdoctor relationship lies at the heart of medicine Confronted with the challenges of COVID19, we find ourselves unable to provide care and comfort in the same physical space as our patients As we are forced to reckon with telemedicine visits and contemplate continuing them in a postpandemic future, it is important to understand the difference relationally between telemedicine and facetoface encounters I will argue that facetoface visits remain essential in establishing the most fundamentally human components of relationships responsibility and vulnerability This established bond assures fidelity in subsequent encounters, whether by phone, video, or in person,,,BACKGROUND Lung ultrasound LUS has received considerable interest in the clinical evaluation of patients with COVID19 Previously described LUS manifestations for COVID19 include Blines, consolidations, and pleural thickening The interrater reliability IRR of these findings for COVID19 is unknown METHODS This study was conducted between March and June 2020 Nine physicians hospitalists n  4 emergency medicine n  5 from 3 medical centers independently evaluated n  20 LUS scans n  180 independent observations collected from patients with COVID19, diagnosed via RTPCR These studies were randomly selected from an image database consisting of COVID19 patients evaluated in the emergency department with portable ultrasound devices Physicians were blinded to any patient information or previous LUS interpretation Kappa values κ were used to calculate IRR RESULTS There was substantial IRR on the following items normal LUS scan κ  079 95 CI 072087, presence of Blines κ  079 95 CI 072087, 3 Blines observed κ  072 95 CI 064079 Moderate IRR was observed for the presence of any consolidation κ  057 95 CI 050064, subpleural consolidation κ  049 95 CI 042056, and presence of effusion κ  049 95 CI 041056 Fair IRR was observed for pleural thickening κ  023 95 CI 015030 DISCUSSION Many LUS manifestations for COVID19 appear to have moderate to substantial IRR across providers from multiple specialties utilizing differing portable devices The most reliable LUS findings with COVID19 may include the presencecount of Blines or determining if a scan is normal Clinical protocols for LUS with COVID19 may require additional observers for the confirmation of less reliable findings such as consolidations,,,BackgroundDuring the COVID19 pandemic, creating tools to assess disease severity is one of the most important aspects of reducing the burden on emergency departments Lung ultrasound has a high accuracy for the diagnosis of pulmonary diseases however, there are few prospective studies demonstrating that lung ultrasound can predict outcomes in COVID19 patients We hypothesized that lung ultrasound score LUS at hospital admission could predict outcomes of COVID19 patients This is a prospective cohort study conducted from 14 March through 6 May 2020 in the emergency department ED of an urban, academic, level I trauma center Patients aged 18xa0years and older and admitted to the ED with confirmed COVID19 were considered eligible Emergency physicians performed lung ultrasounds and calculated LUS, which was tested for correlation with outcomes This protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee number 3990817 CAAE 30417520000000068ResultsThe primary endpoint was death from any cause The secondary endpoints were ICU admission and endotracheal intubation for respiratory failure Among 180 patients with confirmed COVID19 who were enrolled mean age, 60xa0years 105 male, the average LUS was 187u2009u200968 LUS correlated with findings from chest CT and could predict the estimated extent of parenchymal involvement mean LUS withu2009u200950 involvement, p,The immune system plays a pivotal role in the initiation, development and resolution of inflammation following insult or damage to organs The heart is a vital organ which supplies nutrients and oxygen to all parts of the body Heart failure HF has been conventionally described as a disease associated with cardiac tissue damage caused by systemic inflammation, arrhythmia and conduction defects Cardiac inflammation and subsequent tissue damage is orchestrated by the infiltration and activation of various immune cells including neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, eosinophils, mast cells, natural killer cells, and T and B cells into the myocardium After tissue injury, monocytes and tissueresident macrophages undergo marked phenotypic and functional changes, and function as key regulators of tissue repair, regeneration and fibrosis Disturbance in resident macrophage functions such as uncontrolled production of inflammatory cytokines, growth factors and inefficient generation of an antiinflammatory response or unsuccessful communication between macrophages and epithelial and endothelial cells and fibroblasts can lead to aberrant repair, persistent injury, and HF Therefore, in this review, we discuss the role of cardiac macrophages on cardiac inflammation, tissue repair, regeneration and fibrosis,The new coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 has been emerged as a rapidly spreading pandemic The disease is thought to spread mainly from persontoperson through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks The pathogen of COVID19 is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 It infects the cells binding to the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 receptor ACE2 which is expressed by cells throughout the airways as targets for cellular entry Although the majority of persons infected with SARSCoV2 experience symptoms of mild upper respiratory tract infection, in some people infections of the acinar airways result in severe, potentially fatal pneumonia However, the induction of COVID19 pneumonia requires that SARSCoV2 reaches the acinar airways While huge efforts have been made to understand the spread of the disease as well as the pathogenesis following cellular entry, much less attention is paid to how SARSCoV2 from the environment reach the receptors of the target cells The aim of the present study is to characterize the deposition distribution of SARSCoV2 in the airways upon exposure to coughgenerated droplets and aerosol particles For this purpose, the Stochastic Lung Deposition Model has been applied Particle size distribution, breathing parameters supposing normal breathing through the nose, and viral loads were taken from the literature We found that the probability of direct infection of the acinar airways due to inhalation of particles emitted by a bystander cough is very low As the number of viruses deposited in the extrathoracic airways is about 7 times higher than in the acinar airways, we concluded that in most cases COVID19 pneumonia must be preceded by SARSCoV2 infection of the upper airways Our results suggest that without the enhancement of viral load in the upper airways, COVID19 would be much less dangerous The period between the onset of initial symptoms and the potential clinical deterioration could provide an opportunity for prevention of pneumonia by blocking or significantly reducing the transport of viruses towards the acinar airways Therefore, even nonspecific treatment forms like disinfection of the throat and nasal and oral mucosa may effectively keep the viral load of the upper airways low enough to avoid or prolong the progression of the disease In addition, using a tissue or cloth in order to absorb droplets and aerosol particles emitted by own coughs of infected patients before reinhalation is highly recommended even if they are alone in quarantine,,The principal source of vitamin D in humans is its biosynthesis in the skin through a chemical reaction dependent on sun exposure In lesser amounts, the vitamin can be obtained from the diet, mostly from fatty fish, fish liver oil and mushrooms Individuals with vitamin D deficiency, defined as a serum level of 25 hydroxyvitamin D,,Myocardial injury is a common complication of the COVID19 illness and is associated with a worsened prognosis Systemic hyperinflammation seen in the advanced stage of COVID19 likely contributes to myocardial injury Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging CMR is the preferred imaging modality for noninvasive evaluation in acute myocarditis, enabling risk stratification and prognostication Modified scanning protocols in the pandemic setting reduce risk of exposure while providing critical data regarding cardiac tissue inflammation and fibrosis, chamber remodeling, and contractile function The growing use of CMR in clinical practice to assess myocardial injury will improve understanding of the acute and chronic sequelae of myocardial inflammation from various pathological etiologies,COVID19 is caused by SARSCoV2 Although pulmonary manifestations have been identified as the major symptoms, several hematological abnormalities have also been identified This review summarizes the reported hematological abnormalities changes in platelet, white blood cell, and hemoglobin, and coagulationfibrinolytic alterations, explores their pathomechanisms, and discusses its management Common hematological abnormalities in COVID19 are lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated Ddimer levels These alterations are significantly more commonprominent in patients with severe COVID19 disease, and thus may serve as a possible biomarker for those needing hospitalization and intensive care unit care Close attention needs to be paid to coagulation abnormalities, and steps should be taken to prevent these occurring or to mitigate their harmful effects The effect of COVID19 in patients with hematological abnormalities and recognized hematological drug toxicities of therapies for COVID19 are also outlined,,Compromised lung function is a feature of both infection driven and noninfective pathologies Viral infectionsincluding the current pandemic strain SARSCoV2that affect lung function can cause both acute and longterm chronic damage SARSCoV2 infection suppresses innate immunity and promotes an inflammatory response Targeting these aspects of SARSCoV2 is important as the pandemic affects greater proportions of the population In clinical and animal studies, fucoidans have been shown to increase innate immunity and decrease inflammation In addition, dietary fucoidan has been shown to attenuate pulmonary damage in a model of acute viral infection Direct inhibition of SARSCoV2 in vitro has been described, but is not universal This short review summarizes the current research on fucoidan with regard to viral lung infections and lung damage,Endothelial cells have emerged as key players in SARSCoV2 infection and COVID19 inflammatory pathologies Dysfunctional endothelial cells can promote chronic inflammation and disease processes like thrombosis, atherosclerosis, and lung injury In endothelial cells, mitochondria regulate these inflammatory pathways via redox signaling, which is primarily achieved through mitochondrial reactive oxygen species mtROS Excess mtROS causes oxidative stress that can initiate and exacerbate senescence, a state that promotes inflammation and chronic endothelial dysfunction Oxidative stress can also activate feedback loops that perpetuate mitochondrial dysfunction, mtROS overproduction, and inflammation In this review, we provide an overview of phenotypes mediated by mtROS in endothelial cells  such as mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and senescence  as well as how these chronic states may be initiated by SARSCoV2 infection of endothelial cells We also propose that SARSCoV2 activates mtROSmediated feedback loops that cause longterm changes in host redox status and endothelial function, promoting cardiovascular disease and lung injury after recovery from COVID19 Finally, we discuss the implications of these proposed pathways on longterm vascular health and potential treatments to address these chronic conditions,BACKGROUND There are limited data on the neutralizing activity of convalescent plasma CP administered in randomized controlled trials RCT of COVID19 infection STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS As part of an RCT, CP was collected per FDA guidelines from individuals recovered from COVID19 infection CP donors had to have 145 optical density OD units ideal target 300 using a semiquantitative, immunochromatographic test for IgG antibody to the nucleocapsid protein NP of SARSCoV2 typical range 0500 OD units A random subset of samples 14 control plasma, 12 CP mediumantiNP 145299 OD units, and 13 CP high antiNP 300 OD units were tested for neutralizing antibodies using an established viral luciferase antibody inhibition assay to detect the infection of SARSCoV2 pseudovirus that encoded spike protein SARS2Strunc  on a human immunodeficiency virus 1 vector NL43dEnvNanoLuc, using ACE2expressing 293u2009T cells The titer needed to neutralize 50 of viral activity NT50 was calculated RESULTS The uptake of SARSCoV2 pseudovirus by 293TACE2 cells was inhibited by pretreatment with CP compared to control CP pu2009180 in 100 of randomly selected samples, using a conservative approach that excluded nonspecific binding DISCUSSION Plasma from donors screened using an immunochromatographic test for IgG antibody to SARSCoV2 NP exhibited neutralizing activity meeting FDAs minimum standard in all randomly selected COVID19 CP units,Seasonality of respiratory diseases has been linked, among other factors, to low outdoor absolute humidity and low relative humidity in indoor environments, which increase evaporation of water in the mucosal layer lining the respiratory tract We demonstrate that normal breathing results in an absorptiondesorption cycle inside facemasks, where supersaturated air is absorbed by the mask fibers during expiration, followed by evaporation during inspiration of dry environmental air For doublelayered cotton masks, which have considerable heat capacity, the temperature of inspired air rises above room temperature, and the effective increase in relative humidity can exceed 100 We propose that the recently reported, diseaseattenuating effect of generic facemasks is dominated by the strong humidity increase of inspired air SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Facemasks are the most widely used tool for mitigating the spread of the COVID19 pandemic Decreased disease severity by the wearer has also been linked to the use of cloth facemasks This welldocumented finding is surprising considering that such masks are poor at filtering the smallest aerosol particles, which can reach the lower respiratory tract and have been associated with severe disease We show that facemasks strongly increase the effective humidity of inhaled air, thereby promoting hydration of the respiratory epithelium which is known to be beneficial to the immune system Increased humidity of inspired air could be an alternate explanation for the now wellestablished link between mask wearing and lower disease severity,BackgroundIt had been shown that Highflow nasal cannula HFNC is an effective initial support strategy for patients with acute respiratory failure However, the efficacy of HFNC for patients with COVID19 has not been established This study was performed to assess the efficacy of HFNC for patients with COVID19 and describe early predictors of HFNC treatment success in order to develop a prediction tool that accurately identifies the need for upgrade respiratory support therapyMethodsWe retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with COVID19 treated by HFNC in respiratory wards of 2 hospitals in Wuhan between 1 January and 1 March 2020 Overall clinical outcomes, the success rate of HFNC strategy and related respiratory variables were evaluatedResultsA total of 105 patients were analyzed Of these, 65 patients 619 showed improved oxygenation and were successfully withdrawn from HFNC The PaO2FiO2 ratio, SpO2FiO2 ratio and ROX index SpO2FiO2RR at 6h, 12h and 24h of HFNC initiation were closely related to the prognosis The ROX index after 6h of HFNC initiation AUROC, 0798 had good predictive capacity for outcomes of HFNC In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, young age, gender of female, and lower SOFA score all have predictive value, while a ROX index greater than 555 at 6u2009h after initiation was significantly associated with HFNC success OR, 17821 95 CI, 374184903 p0001ConclusionsOur study indicated that HFNC was an effective way of respiratory support in the treatment of COVID19 patients The ROX index after 6h after initiating HFNC had good predictive capacity for HFNC outcomes,The global pandemic of COVID19 is posing the biggest threat to humanity through its ubiquitous effect of unfathomable magnitude Although COVID19 is a viral disease, there might be an association between different comorbidities and the occurrence of the disease Our study aims to determine the association between the COVID19 infection and preexisting comorbidities such as asthma, diabetes, liver disease, lung disease, heart disease, kidney disease, hypertension, and obesity through a webbased selfreported survey Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were done using these risk factors as independent variables A total of 780,961 participants from 183 different countries and territories participated in this study Among them, 1516 participants were diagnosed with COVID19 prior to this study A significant risk association was observed for age above 60xa0years, female gender, as well as different preexisting disease conditions such as diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease, and heart diseases Asthma and diabetes were the major dominant comorbidities among patients, and patients with existing diabetes were more likely to develop the disease than others who did not diagnose as diseased Therefore, older adults, females, as well as people with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, heart disease, kidney disease, and liver disease are the most vulnerable population for COVID19 However, further studies should be carried out to explain the pathway of these risk associations,AIMS The aim of this investigation was to evaluate echocardiographic parameters of cardiac function and in particular right ventricular RV function as a predictor of mortality in patients with coronavirus disease2019 COVID19 pneumonia METHODS AND RESULTS This prospective observational study included 35 patients admitted to a UK district general hospital with COVID19 and evidence of cardiac involvement, that is, raised Troponin I levels or clinical evidence of heart failure during the first wave of the COVID19 pandemic MarchMay 2020 All patients underwent echocardiography including speckle tracking for right ventricular longitudinal strain RVLS providing image quality was sufficient 30 out of 35 patients Upon comparison of patients who survived COVID19 with nonsurvivors, survivors had significantly smaller RVs basal RV diameter 382 vs 435xa0mm Pxa0xa00295 with significantly better RV function Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion TAPSE 175 vs 153xa0mm Pxa0xa0049 average RVLS 243 vs 156 Pxa0xa00018 Tricuspid regurgitation TR maximal velocity was higher in survivors 275xa0ms vs 211xa0ms Pxa0xa00045 indicating that pressure overload was not the predominant driver of this effect and there was no significant difference in left ventricular LV ejection fraction KaplanMeier and logrank analysis of patients split into groups according to average RVLS above or below 20 revealed significantly increased 30day mortality in patients with average RVLS under 20 HR 3189 95 CI 12971291 Pxa0xa00195 CONCLUSION This study confirms that RVLS is a potent and independent predictor of outcome in COVID19 patients with evidence of cardiac involvement,This letter is a response to the letter to the editor written by Bevelacqua etxa0al regarding The risk of induced cancer and ischemic heart disease following low dose lung irradiation for COVID19,Abstract In our study, procalcitonin was associated with both antibiotic use and duration in patients with COVID19, as well as established biochemical markers of COVID19 disease severity and oxygen requirement, suggesting a potential role for procalcitonin in COVID19 antimicrobial stewardship,Graphical Abstract  The year in coronary interventions ACS, acute coronary syndrome CCS, chronic coronary syndrome COVID19 coronavirus disease19 DEB, drugeluting balloon DAPT, dual antiplatelet therapy ISR, instent restenosis,,Abstract  Background Increased inflammation is a hallmark of COVID19, with pulmonary and systemic inflammation identified in multiple cohorts of patients Definitive cellular and molecular pathways driving severe forms of this disease remain uncertain Neutrophils, the most numerous leukocytes in blood circulation, can contribute to immunopathology in infections, inflammatory diseases and acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS, a primary cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID19 Changes in multiple neutrophil functions and circulating cytokine levels over time during COVID19 may help define disease severity and guide care and decision making   Methods  Blood was obtained serially from critically ill COVID19 patients for 11 days Neutrophil oxidative burst, neutrophil extracellular trap formation NETosis, phagocytosis and cytokine levels were assessed ex vivo  Lung tissue was obtained immediately postmortem for immunostaining    Results Elevations in neutrophilassociated cytokines IL8 and IL6, and general inflammatory cytokines IP10, GMCSF, IL1b, IL10 and TNF, were identified in COVID19 plasma both at the first measurement and at multiple timepoints across hospitalization p  00001 Neutrophils had exaggerated oxidative burst p  00001, NETosis p  00001 and phagocytosis p  00001 relative to controls Increased NETosis correlated with both leukocytosis and neutrophilia Neutrophils and NETs were identified within airways and alveoli in the lung parenchyma of 40 of SARSCoV2 infected lungs While elevations in IL8 and ANC correlated to COVID19 disease severity, plasma IL8 levels alone correlated with death   Conclusions Circulating neutrophils in COVID19 exhibit an activated phenotype with increased oxidative burst, NETosis and phagocytosis Readily accessible and dynamic, plasma IL8 and circulating neutrophil function may be potential COVID19 disease biomarkers,Summary  Most Covid19 victims are old and die from unrelated causes Here we present t welve complete autopsies, including two rapid autopsies of young patients where the cause of death was Covid19 ARDS The main virus induced pathology was in the lung parenchyma and not in the airways Most coagulation events occurred in the intraalveolar and not in the intravascular space and the few thrombi were mainly composed of aggregated thrombocytes The dominant inflammatory response was the massive accumulation of CD163 macrophages and the disappearance of T killer, NK and Bcells The virus was replicating in the pneumocytes and macrophages but not in bronchial epithelium, endothel, pericytes or stromal cells The lung consolidations were produced by a massive regenerative response, stromal and epithelial proliferation and neovascularization We suggest that thrombocyte aggregation inhibition, angiogenesis inhibition and general proliferation inhibition may have a roll in the treatment of advanced Covid19 ARDS,To investigate whether severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus2 SARSCoV2induced myocarditis constitutes an important mechanism of cardiac injury, a review was conducted of the published data and the authors experience was added from autopsy examination of 16 patients dying of SARSCoV2 infection Myocarditis is an uncommon pathologic diagnosis occurring in 45 of highly selected cases undergoing autopsy or endomyocardial biopsy Although polymerase chain reactiondetectable virus could be found in the lungs of most coronavirus disease2019 COVID19infected subjects in our own autopsy registry, in only 2 cases was the virus detected in the heart It should be appreciated that myocardial inflammation alone by macrophages and T cells can be seen in noninfectious deaths and COVID19 cases, but the extent of each is different, and in neither case do such findings represent clinically relevant myocarditis Given its extremely low frequency and unclear therapeutic implications, the authors do not advocate use of endomyocardial biopsy to diagnose myocarditis in the setting of COVID19,The worldwide pandemic caused by the SARSCoV2 virus has resulted in over 84,407,000 cases with over 1,800,000 deaths when this paper was submitted, with comorbidities such as gender, race, age, body mass, diabetes, and hypertension greatly exacerbating mortality This review will analyze the rapidly increasing knowledge of COVID19 induced lung pathophysiology Although controversial, the acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS associated with COVID19 CARDS seems to present as two distinct phenotypes TypeL and TypeH The L refers to Low elastance, ventilationperfusion ratio, lung weight, and recruitability, and the H refers to High pulmonary elastance, shunt, edema, and recruitability However, the LUNG SAFE and ESICM Trials Groups has shown that 13 of the mechanically ventilated nonCOVID19 ARDS patients have the TypeL phenotype However, other studies have shown that CARDS and ARDS respiratory mechanics overlap and that standard ventilation strategies apply to these patients The mechanisms causing alterations in pulmonary perfusion could be caused by some combination of 1 reninangiotensin system RAS dysregulation, 2 thrombosis caused by loss of endothelial barrier, 3 endothelial dysfunction causing loss of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction HPV perfusion control, and 4 hyperperfusion of collapsed lung tissue that has been directly measured and supported by a computational model A flow chart has been constructed highlighting the need for personalized and adaptive ventilation strategies, such as the time controlled adaptive ventilation TCAV method to set and adjust the airway pressure release ventilation APRV mode, which recently was shown effective at improving oxygenation and reducing FiO2, vasopressors, and sedation in COVID19 patients,,A 75yearold female with no history of lung disease developed severe pulmonary fibrosis within 1 month of acute severe COVID19 pneumonia She developed dry basal crackles, hypoxia needing home oxygen, and computed tomography changes which dramatically evolved from acute groundglass opacities to honeycombing and traction bronchiectasis Interestingly, these changes occurred despite her being on steroids through most of her hospital stay She is being commenced on pirfenidone and her responses are carefully monitored, but the role of antifibrotic drugs are unclear and will only be established from large clinical trials,Background There is a lack of information about the course of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 in patients with severe asthma who were treated with biologics Some reports indicated that treatment with benralizumab, dupilumab, and omalizumab in patients with severe asthma was not associated with significant adverse effects during COVID19 Methods Asthma itself or the biologic agents used to treat asthma can have a positive effect on the course of COVID19 There seem not to be any cases that specifically reported the use of mepolizumab in a patient who was infected with COVID Results We reported of a 55yearold woman with a diagnosis of severe asthma for 3 years and who was being treated with mepolizumab, with no evidence of loss of asthma control, at the time of contracting COVID19 and who had been followed up in the allergy clinic In addition, there are no data on mepolizumab therapy in patients with elevated liver enzyme levels Conclusion With this case, we also reported that no adverse effects were observed during mepolizumab treatment in a patient with elevated liver enzyme levels,,Right ventricle RV dysfunction is the strongest predictor of mortality in pulmonary arterial hypertension PAH, but, at present, there are no therapies directly targeting the failing RV Although there are shared molecular mechanisms in both RV and left ventricle LV dysfunction, there are important differences between the 2 ventricles that may allow for the development of RVenhancing or RVdirected therapies In this review, we discuss the current understandings of the dysregulated pathways that promote RV dysfunction, highlight RVenriched or RVspecific pathways that may be of particular therapeutic value, and summarize recent and ongoing clinical trials that are investigating RV function in PAH It is hoped that development of RVtargeted therapies will improve quality of life and enhance survival for this deadlyxa0disease,Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2 is an important player of the reninangiotensinaldosterone system RAAS in regulating the conversion of angiotensin II into angiotensin 17 While expressed on the surface of human cells, such as lung, heart, kidney, neurons, and endothelial cells EC, ACE2 is the entry receptor for SARSCoV2 Here, we would like to highlight that ACE2 is predominant on the EC membrane Many of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 symptoms have been associated with the large recruitment of immune cells, directly affecting EC Additionally, cytokines, hypoxia, and complement activation can trigger the activation of EC leading to the coagulation cascade The EC dysfunction plus the inflammation due to SARSCoV2 infection may lead to abnormal coagulation, actively participating in thromboinflammatory processes resulting in vasculopathy and indicating poor prognosis in patients with COVID19 Considering the intrinsic relationship between EC and the pathophysiology of SARSCoV2, ECassociated therapies such as anticoagulants, fibrinolytic drugs, immunomodulators, and molecular therapies have been proposed In this review, we will discuss the role of EC in the lung inflammation and edema, in the disseminate coagulation process, ACE2 positive cancer patients, and current and future ECassociated therapies to treat COVID19,Cardiovascular diseases are culpable for the majority of mortalities the world over, hence the significance of advances in preventive medicine and imaging Cardiovascular imaging constitutes the cornerstone of not only early but also precise diagnoses Indeed, advanced imaging enables cardiologists to make efficacious management plans for various heart conditions The present article discusses essential innovations in cardiovascular imaging,,Objectives To initially clarify the efficacy and tolerability of nintedanib in patients with idiopathicinflammatorymyopathyrelated interstitial lung disease IIMILD Methods A retrospective, realworld analysis was conducted in IIMILD patients who regularly received outpatient visit or hospitalization from January 2018 to March 2020 in three centers And the patients were divided into two groups depending on presence or absence of nintedanib therapy Comparisons, KaplanMeier survival analysis and propensity score matching were made to identify difference in time to death from any cause, incidence of rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease RPILD and comorbidity of pulmonary infection between the two groups The following logistic regression analyses and Cox proportionalhazard regression analyses were used to verify the therapeutic value of nintedanib as well as clinical significance of other factors Adverse events were descriptively recorded Results Thirtysix patients receiving nintedanib therapy and 115 patients without use of nintedanib were included Before and after propensity score matching, the primary comparisons revealed better survival P  0015, P  0016, respectively and lower incidence of RPILD P  0017, P  0014, respectively in patients with nintedanib therapy Logistic regression analysis identified that disease activity P  0001, percentpredicted diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide DLCO, P  0036, nintedanib therapy P  0004, OR value  0072 and amyopathic dermatomyositis ADM, P  0012 were significantly correlated with RPILD Cox proportional hazards regression analysis suggested that disease activity P  0001, antiMDA5 antibody P  0001 and nintedanib therapy P  0013, HR value0268 were significantly associated with survival of IIMILD patients Similar results can also be seen in analyses after propensity score matching In the 36 patients with nintedanib therapy, diarrhea was the most common adverse event 444 and hepatic insufficiency contributed to most dosage reduction 444 of nine patients or therapy discontinuation 600 of five patients Conclusions Nintedanib was found to reduce incidence of RPILD and improve survival in IIMILD patients in a realworld setting AntiMDA5 antibody could be taken as a risk factor for unfavorable outcome ADM was significantly correlated with occurrence of RPILD In addition to the most frequent diarrhea, hepatic insufficiency was closely related to dosage reduction or therapy discontinuation,BACKGROUND Cardiovascular diseases constitute an important group of causes of death in the country Ischemic heart diseases that are the main causes of cardiopulmonary arrest, leading to an impact on the mortality of the cardiovascular diseases in the health system OBJECTIVE Assess the number of home deaths by cardiopulmonary arrest notified by the Mobile Emergency Medical Service SAMU in March 2018, 2019 and 2020 METHODS Observational study carried out from the analysis of cardiopulmonary arrest mortality data of citizens assisted by SAMU in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil Social and clinical characteristics and occurrence information of the patients were analyzed The mortality rate due to cardiopulmonary arrest in relation to the total number of attendances was assessed A significance level of 95 was considered RESULTS There was increase of home deaths due to cardiopulmonary arrest in March 2020 compared to March 2018 p0001 and March 2019 p0050 Of the deaths reported in 2020, 638 of the patients were aged 60 years or older, 637 of the occurrences were performed in the afternoon and approximately 87 of the cardiopulmonary arrest notified had associated clinical comorbidities, with systemic arterial hypertension and heart failure represented by 2287 and 1303 of the reported cases, respectively The majority of the evaluated sample of this study did not have any medical care followup 887 CONCLUSION Considering the increase in the number of the deaths, we suggest reflections and readjustments regarding the monitoring of chronic nontransmissible diseases during a pandemic, as well as improvements in death surveillance Arq Bras Cardiol 2021 1162266271,OBJECTIVES During severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 infection, dramatic endothelial cell damage with pulmonary microvascular thrombosis have been was hypothesized to occur The aim was to assess whether pulmonary vascular thrombosis PVT is due to recurrent thromboembolism from peripheral deep vein thrombosis or to local inflammatory endothelial damage, with a superimposed thrombotic late complication DESIGN Observational study SETTING Medical and intensive care unit wards of a teaching hospital PARTICIPANTS The authors report a subset of patients included in a prospective institutional study CovidBiob study with clinical suspicion of pulmonary vascular thromboembolism INTERVENTIONS Computed tomography pulmonary angiography and evaluation of laboratory markers and coagulation profile MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Twentyeight of 55 509 patients showed PVT, with a median time interval from symptom onset of 175 days Simultaneous multiple PVTs were identified in 22 patients, with bilateral involvement in 16, mostly affecting segmentalsubsegmental pulmonary artery branches 678 and 964 Patients with PVT had significantly higher ground glass opacity areas 317 22941 v 178 108221, p  0001 compared with those without PVT Remarkably, in all 28 patients, ground glass opacities areas and PVT had an almost perfect spatial overlap Ddimer level at hospital admission was predictive of PVT CONCLUSIONS The findings identified a specific radiologic pattern of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pneumonia with a unique spatial distribution of PVT overlapping areas of groundglass opacities These findings supported the hypothesis of a pathogenetic relationship between COVID19 lung inflammation and PVT and challenged the previous definition of pulmonary embolism associated with COVID19 pneumonia,Background Increased levels of circulating complement activation products have been reported in COVID19 patients, but only limited information is available on complement involvement at tissue level The mechanisms and pathways of local complement activation remain unclear Methods We performed immunofluorescence analyses of autopsy specimens of lungs, kidney and liver from nine COVID19 patients who died of acute respiratory failure Snapfrozen samples embedded in OCT were stained with antibodies against complement components and activation products, IgG and spike protein of SARSCoV2 Findings Lung deposits of C1q, C4, C3 and C5b9 were localized in the capillaries of the interalveolar septa and on alveolar cells IgG displayed a similar even distribution, suggesting classical pathway activation The spike protein is a potential target of IgG, but its uneven distribution suggests that other viral and tissue molecules may be targeted by IgG Factor B deposits were also seen in COVID19 lungs and are consistent with activation of the alternative pathway, whereas MBL and MASP2 were hardly detectable Analysis of kidney and liver specimens mirrored findings observed in the lung Complement deposits were seen on tubules and vessels of the kidney with only mild C5b9 staining in glomeruli, and on hepatic artery and portal vein of the liver Interpretation Complement deposits in different organs of deceased COVID19 patients caused by activation of the classical and alternative pathways support the multiorgan nature of the disease Funding Grants from the Italian Ministry of Health COVID202012371808 to PLM and National Institutes of Health HL150146 to NP are gratefully acknowledged,Background Despite the fastgrowing understanding of the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19, patient management remains largely empirical or based on retrospective studies In this complex scenario, an important clinical issue appears to be represented by the high prevalence of thromboembolic events, but the data regarding highrisk pulmonary embolism PE is still not available Case summary A patient with COVID19 developed sudden shortness of breath and hypoxia Early echocardiographic diagnosis of highrisk PE related to right heart thrombus was performed Systemic thrombolysis was administered with excellent clinical and haemodynamic response Discussion Pulmonary thromboembolism is a common occurrence in severe COVID19 infection In our experience, systemic thrombolysis proved to be effective and for this reason may be considered for lifethreatening PE in COVID19 patients,Airway examination procedures can potentially transmit infectious diseases to patients and to the health care professionals who perform them via various mechanisms The COVID19 pandemic has halted most of the activity of the clinics and laboratories involved in assessment of lung and nasal function, and clear recommendations in this regard have been made Today, we still do not know for sure what its consequences will be in the short or long term, since important gaps remain in our knowledge of aspects as fundamental as virus transmission mechanisms, pathophysiology, immune response, and diagnosis In this review, we study the examination techniques used to assess patients with respiratory allergy, asthma, and associated diseases during this period and highlight their possible advantages and disadvantages Therefore, we focus on exploring the entire upper and lower airways, from the perspective of the safety of both health professionals and patients and their specific characteristics We also analyze the intrinsic value of these interventions in terms of diagnosis and patient management The changing situation of COVID19 may mean that some of the assertions presented in this review will have to be modified in the future While we seek to ensure a consistently broad approach, some differences in operational details may apply owing to local regulations,While mesenchymal stromal cells are an appealing therapeutic option for a range of clinical applications, their potential to induce clotting when used systemically remains a safety concern, particularly in hypercoagulable conditions, such as in patients with severe COVID19, trauma, or cancers Here, we tested a novel preclinical approach aimed at improving the safety of mesenchymal stromal cell MSC systemic administration by use of a bioreactor In this system, MSCs are seeded on the exterior of a hollowfiber filter, sequestering them behind a hemocompatible semipermeable membrane with defined poresize and permeability to allow for a molecularly defined cross talk between the therapeutic cells and the whole blood environment, including blood cells and signaling molecules The potential for these bioreactor MSCs to induce clots in coagulable plasma was compared against directly injected free MSCs, a model of systemic administration Our results showed that restricting MSCs exposure to plasma via a bioreactor extends the time necessary for clot formation to occur when compared with free MSCs Measurement of cell surface data indicates the presence of known clot inducing factors, namely tissue factor and phosphatidylserine Results also showed that recovering cells and flushing the bioreactor prior to use further prolonged clot formation time Furthermore, application of this technology in two in vivo models did not require additional heparin in fully anticoagulated experimental animals to maintain target activated clotting time levels relative to heparin anticoagulated controls Taken together the clinical use of bioreactor housed MSCs could offer a novel method to control systemic MSC exposure and prolong clot formation time,Advances in bronchoscopic and other interventional pulmonology technologies have expanded the sampling procedures pulmonologist can use to diagnose lung cancer and accurately stage the mediastinum Among the modalities available to the interventional pulmonologist are endobronchial ultrasoundguided transbronchial needles aspiration EBUSTBNA and transoesophageal bronchoscopic ultrasoundguided fineneedle aspiration EUSBFNA for sampling peribronchialperioesophageal central lesions and for mediastinal lymph node staging, as well as navigational bronchoscopy and radial probe endobronchial ultrasound RPEBUS for the diagnosis of peripheral lung cancer The role of the interventional pulmonologist in this setting is to apply these procedures based on the correct interpretation of clinical and radiological findings in order to maximise the chances of achieving the diagnosis and obtaining sufficient tissue for molecular biomarker testing to guide targeted therapies for advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer The safest and the highest diagnosisyielding modality should be chosen to avoid a repeat sampling procedure if the first one is nondiagnostic The choice of site and biopsy modality are influenced by tumour location, patient comorbidities, availability of equipment and local expertise This review provides a concise stateofthe art account of the interventional pulmonology procedures in the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer,,This position paper has been drafted by experts from the Czech national board of diseases with bronchial obstruction, of the Czech Pneumological and Phthisiological Society The statements and recommendations are based on both the results of randomized controlled trials and data from crosssectional and prospective reallife studies to ensure they are as close as possible to the context of daily clinical practice and the current health care system of the Czech Republic Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease COPD is a preventable and treatable heterogeneous syndrome with a number of pulmonary and extrapulmonary clinical features and concomitant chronic diseases The disease is associated with significant mortality, morbidity and reduced quality of life The main characteristics include persistent respiratory symptoms and only partially reversible airflow obstruction developing due to an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles and gases Oxidative stress, proteaseantiprotease imbalance and increased numbers of proinflammatory cells mainly neutrophils are the main drivers of primarily noninfectious inflammation in COPD Besides smoking, household air pollution, occupational exposure, low birth weight, frequent respiratory infections during childhood and also genetic factors are important risk factors of COPD development Progressive airflow limitation and airway remodelling leads to air trapping, static and dynamic hyperinflation, gas exchange abnormalities and decreased exercise capacity Various features of the disease are expressed unequally in individual patients, resulting in various types of disease presentation, emerging as the clinical phenotypes for specific clinical characteristics and treatable traits for treatable characteristics concept The estimated prevalence of COPD in Czechia is around 67 with 3,2003,500 deaths reported annually The elementary requirements for diagnosis of COPD are spirometric confirmation of postbronchodilator airflow obstruction postBD FEV1VCmax 70 and respiratory symptoms assessement dyspnoea, exercise limitation, cough andor sputum production In order to establish definite COPD diagnosis, a fivestep evaluation should be performed, including 1 inhalation risk assessment, 2 symptoms evaluation, 3 lung function tests, 4 laboratory tests and 5 imaging At the same time, all alternative diagnoses should be excluded For disease classification, this position paper uses both GOLD stages 1 to 4, GOLD groups A to D and evaluation of clinical phenotypes Prognosis assessment should be done in each patient For this purpose, we recommend the use of the BODE or the CADOT index Six elementary clinical phenotypes are recognized, including chronic bronchitis, frequent exacerbator, emphysematous, asthmaCOPD overlap ACO, bronchiectases with COPD overlap BCO and pulmonary cachexia In our concept, all of these clinical phenotypes are also considered independent treatable traits For each treatable trait, specific pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies are defined in this document The coincidence of two or more clinical phenotypes ie, treatable traits may occur in a single individual, giving the opportunity of fully individualized, phenotypespecific treatment Treatment of COPD should reflect the complexity and heterogeneity of the disease and be tailored to individual patients Major goals of COPD treatment are symptom reduction and decreased exacerbation risk Treatment strategy is divided into five strata risk elimination, basic treatment, phenotypespecific treatment, treatment of respiratory failure and palliative care, and treatment of comorbidities Risk elimination includes interventions against tobacco smoking and environmentaloccupational exposures Basic treatment is based on bronchodilator therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation, vaccination, care for appropriate nutrition, inhalation training, education and psychosocial support Adequate phenotypespecific treatment varies phenotype by phenotype, including more than ten different pharmacological and nonpharmacological strategies If more than one clinical phenotype is present, treatment strategy should follow the expression of each phenotypic label separately In such patients, multicomponental therapeutic regimens are needed, resulting in fully individualized care In the future, stronger measures against smoking, improvements in occupational and environmental health, early diagnosis strategies, as well as biomarker identification for patients responsive to specific treatments are warranted New classes of treatment inhaled PDE34 inhibitors, single molecule dual bronchodilators, antiinflammatory drugs, gene editing molecules or new bronchoscopic procedures are expected to enter the clinical practice in a very few years,This collaborative statement from the International Society for Holter and Noninvasive ElectrocardiologyHeart Rhythm SocietyEuropean Heart Rhythm AssociationAsiaPacific Heart Rhythm Society describes the current status of mobile health technologies in arrhythmia management The range of digital medical tools and heart rhythm disorders that they may be applied to and clinical decisions that may be enabled are discussed The facilitation of comorbidity and lifestyle management increasingly recognized to play a role in heart rhythm disorders and patient selfmanagement are novel aspects of mobile health The promises of predictive analytics but also operational challenges in embedding mobile health into routine clinical care are explored,,Objective As COVID19 spreads across the world, there are concerns that people with asthma are at a higher risk of acquiring the disease, or of poorer outcomes This systematic review aimed to summarise evidence on the risk of infection, severe illness and death from COVID19 in people with asthma Data Sources and Study Selection A comprehensive search of electronic databases including preprint repositories and WHO COVID19 database was conducted until 26 May 2020 Studies reporting COVID19 in people with asthma were included For binary outcomes, we performed SidikJonkman random effects metaanalysis We explored quantitative heterogeneity by subgroup analyses, meta regression and evaluating the I2 statistic Results Fiftyseven studies with an overall sample size of 587,280 were included The prevalence of asthma among those infected with COVID19 was 746 95 CI 625867 Nonsevere asthma was more common than severe asthma 961 vs 413 Pooled analysis showed a 14 risk ratio reduction in acquiring COVID19 95 CI 080094 pu2009u200900001 and 13 reduction in hospitalisation with COVID19 95 CI 077099, pu2009u2009003 for people with asthma compared with those without There was no significant difference in the combined risk of requiring admission to ICU andor receiving mechanical ventilation for people with asthma RR 087 95 CI 094137 pu2009u2009019 and risk of death from COVID19 RR 087 95 CI 068110 pu2009u2009025 Conclusion The findings from this study suggest that the prevalence of people with asthma among COVID19 patients is similar to the global prevalence of asthma The overall findings suggest that people with asthma have a lower risk than those without asthma for acquiring COVID19 and have similar clinical outcomes,Given the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic, investigations into host susceptibility to infectious diseases and downstream sequelae have never been more relevant Pneumonia is a lung disease that can cause respiratory failure and hypoxia and is a common complication of infectious diseases, including COVID19 Few genomewide association studies GWASs of host susceptibility and severity of pneumonia have been conducted We performed GWASs of pneumonia susceptibility and severity in the Vanderbilt University biobank BioVU with linked electronic health records EHRs, including Illumina Expanded MultiEthnic Global Array MEGAEXgenotyped European ancestry EA, n 69,819 and African ancestry AA, n  15,603 individuals Two regions of large effect were identified the CFTR locus in EA rs113827944 OR  184, p value  12xa0× 1036 and HBB in AA rs334 pGlu7Val OR  163, p value  35xa0× 1013 Mutations in these genes cause cystic fibrosis CF and sickle cell disease SCD, respectively After removing individuals diagnosed with CF and SCD, we assessed heterozygosity effects at our lead variants Further GWASs after removing individuals with CF uncovered an additional association in R3HCC1L rs10786398 OR  122, p value  35xa0× 108, which was replicated in two independent datasets UK Biobank n  459,741 and 7,985 nonoverlapping BioVU subjects, who are genotyped on arrays other than MEGAEX This variant was also validated in GWASs of COVID19 hospitalization and lung function Our results highlight the importance of the host genome in infectious disease susceptibility and severity and offer crucial insight into genetic effects that could potentially influence severity of COVID19 sequelae,BACKGROUND Several studies have recently addressed factors associated with severe Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 however, some medications and comorbidities have yet to be evaluated in a large matched cohort We therefore explored the role of relevant comorbidities and medications in relation to the risk of intensive care unit ICU admission and mortality METHODS All ICU COVID19 patients in Sweden until 27 May 2020 were matched to population controls on age and gender to assess the risk of ICU admission Cases were identified, comorbidities and medications were retrieved from highquality registries Three conditional logistic regression models were used for risk of ICU admission and three Cox proportional hazards models for risk of ICU mortality, one with comorbidities, one with medications and finally with both models combined, respectively RESULTS We included 1981 patients and 7924 controls Hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, asthma, obesity, being a solid organ transplant recipient and immunosuppressant medications were independent risk factors of ICU admission and oral anticoagulants were protective Stroke, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and treatment with reninangiotensinaldosterone inhibitors RAASi were independent risk factors of ICU mortality in the prespecified primary analyses treatment with statins was protective However, after adjusting for the use of continuous renal replacement therapy, RAASi were no longer an independent risk factor CONCLUSION In our cohort oral anticoagulants were protective of ICU admission and statins was protective of ICU death Several comorbidities and ongoing RAASi treatment were independent risk factors of ICU admission and ICU mortality,The recent emergence of coronavirus disease2019 COVID19 as a pandemic affecting millions of individuals has raised great concern throughout the world, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 SARSCoV2 was identified as the causative agent for COVID19 The multifunctional protein angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ACE2 is accepted as its primary target for entry into host cells In its enzymatic function, ACE2, like its homologue ACE, regulates the reninangiotensin system RAS critical for cardiovascular and renal homeostasis in mammals Unlike ACE, however, ACE2 drives an alternative RAS pathway by degrading AngII and thus operates to balance RAS homeostasis in the context of hypertension, heart failure, and cardiovascular as well as renal complications of diabetes Outside the RAS, ACE2 hydrolyzes key peptides, such as amyloidβ, apelin, and desArg9bradykinin In addition to its enzymatic functions, ACE2 is found to regulate intestinal amino acid homeostasis and the gut microbiome Although the nonenzymatic function of ACE2 as the entry receptor for SARSCoV2 has been well established, the contribution of enzymatic functions of ACE2 to the pathogenesis of COVID19related lung injury has been a matter of debate A complete understanding of this central enzyme may begin to explain the various symptoms and pathologies seen in SARSCoV2 infected individuals, and may aid in the development of novel treatments for COVID19,Physiological fibrinolysis under normal conditions progresses slowly, in contrast to coagulation which is triggered rapidly to stop bleeding and defend against microbial invasion Methods to detect fibrinolysis abnormalities are less simple and poorly standardized compared with common coagulation tests Fibrinolysis can be accelerated by preparing euglobulin from plasma to reduce endogenous inhibitors, or by adding plasminogen activators to normal plasma However, these manipulations complicate interpretation of results and diagnosis of a fibrinolysis deficit Many observational studies on antigen levels of fibrinolysis inhibitors, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 or thrombinactivatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, zymogen or active enzyme have been published However, conclusions are mixed and there are clear problems with harmonization of results Viscoelastic methods have the advantage of being rapid and are used as pointofcare tests They also work with whole blood, allowing the contribution of platelets to be explored However, there are no agreed protocols for applying viscoelastic methods in acute care for the diagnosis of hyperfibrinolysis or to direct therapy The emergence of SARSCoV2 and the dangers of associated coagulopathy provide new challenges A common finding in hospitalized patients is high levels of Ddimer fibrin breakdown products, indicative of ongoing fibrinolysis Wellestablished problems with Ddimer testing standardization signal that we should be cautious in using results from such tests as prognostic indicators or to target therapies,,Due to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 pandemic, the world is currently facing high morbidity and mortality rates as well as severe disruption to normal societal and social structures SARSCoV2 uses the ACE2 receptor for cellular entry In a recent publication of The Journal of Pathology, Liu and coworkers highlight the effects of cigarette smoking on ACE2 expression in the respiratory epithelium The authors studied the effects of acute cigarette smoke exposure in a murine model and confirmed their findings in human lung tissues and gene expression datasets Their findings demonstrate that cigarette smoking increases ACE2 expression specifically at the apical surface of the airway epithelium Smoking cessation resulted in lower ACE2 expression, with implications for attenuating the risk of transmission of the virus The role of ACE2 expression in the development of COVID19 symptoms is still under investigation, with conflicting results from experimental models on the role of ACE2 expression in SARSCoV2induced lung injury In this commentary, we highlight the implications and limitations of the study of Liu et al as well as future therapeutic strategies directed

stress cardiomyopathy with a relatively benign longterm course, but may lead to arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock in the acute setting Despite a recent rise in suspected stressinduced cardiomyopathy, the relationship between the novel coronavirus disease 19 COVID19 and TTS is not fully understood Early recognition of TTS in these patients is important to guide management and treatment We present 2 cases of TTS arising in the setting of COVID19 with rapid progression to biventricular heart failure and cardiogenic shock,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement TAVR remains a complex procedure with the potential for lifethreatening complications including heart block, bleeding from vascular access sites, and peric,,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 induces coronavirus19 disease COVID19 and is a major health concern Following two SARSCoV2 pandemic waves, intensive care unit ICU specialists are treating a large number of COVID19associated acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS patients From a pathophysiological perspective, prominent mechanisms of COVID19associated ARDS CARDS include severe pulmonary infiltrationoedema and inflammation leading to impaired alveolar homeostasis, alteration of pulmonary physiology resulting in pulmonary fibrosis, endothelial inflammation endotheliitis, vascular thrombosis, and immune cell activation Although the syndrome ARDS serves as umbrella term, distinct, ie CARDSspecific pathomechanisms and comorbidities can be noted eg virusinduced endotheliitis associated with thromboembolism and some aspects of CARDS can be considered ARDS atypical Importantly, specific evidencebased medical interventions for CARDS with the potential exception of corticosteroid use are currently unavailable, limiting treatment efforts to mostly supportive ICU care In this article, we will discuss the underlying pulmonary pathophysiology and the clinical management of CARDS In addition, we will outline current and potential future treatment approaches,Objective Since December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID 19 has been experienced from Wuhan, China to the world A retrospective cohort study was conducted to summarize the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID19 and to explore the risk factors affecting the disease duration in Jiangan Fangcang shelter hospital, Wuhan, China Methods Clinical characteristics of 409 patients with COVID19 were retrospectively analyzed We describe the clinical characteristics and distribution of discharge time or transfer time for each patient Then we performed univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis to identify potential risk factors for progression from nonsevere to severe COVID19 or death Results The median disease duration of all patients was 23 days IQR 1928 The main symptoms of the patient were fever 956, cough 743, tiredness 215, and so on Comorbidities mainly included hypertension 306 diabetes 176 and heart disease 125 The univariate Cox regression analysis showed that old age, number of symptoms, the combination of hypertension, heart disease and pulmonary disease were associated with the progression of disease The multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that old age HR 7294 95 CI 144236888 P  0016, the combination of hypertension HR 2230 95 CI 10904562 P  0028 and heart disease HR 2650 95 CI 10796510 P  0034 were independent risk factors for progression of COVID19 Conclusions The age of the patient, the combination of hypertension and heart disease were independent risk factors for the progression of COVID19 Cautions should be raised for patients with these risk factors,,,BACKGROUND Studies of patients admitted to hospital with COVID19 have found varying mortality outcomes associated with underlying respiratory conditions and inhaled corticosteroid use Using data from a national, multicentre, prospective cohort, we aimed to characterise people with COVID19 admitted to hospital with underlying respiratory disease, assess the level of care received, measure inhospital mortality, and examine the effect of inhaled corticosteroid use METHODS We analysed data from the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium ISARIC WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK CCPUK study All patients admitted to hospital with COVID19 across England, Scotland, and Wales between Jan 17 and Aug 3, 2020, were eligible for inclusion in this analysis Patients with asthma, chronic pulmonary disease, or both, were identified and stratified by age 16 years, 1649 years, and 50 years Inhospital mortality was measured by use of multilevel Cox proportional hazards, adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and medications inhaled corticosteroids, shortacting βagonists SABAs, and longacting βagonists LABAs Patients with asthma who were taking an inhaled corticosteroid plus LABA plus another maintenance asthma medication were considered to have severe asthma FINDINGS 75u2009463 patients from 258 participating healthcare facilities were included in this analysis 860 patients younger than 16 years 74 8·6 with asthma, 8950 patients aged 1649 years 1867 20·9 with asthma, and 65u2009653 patients aged 50 years and older 5918 9·0 with asthma, 10u2009266 15·6 with chronic pulmonary disease, and 2071 3·2 with both asthma and chronic pulmonary disease Patients with asthma were significantly more likely than those without asthma to receive critical care patients aged 1649 years adjusted odds ratio OR 1·20 95 CI 1·051·37 p0·0080 patients aged 50 years adjusted OR 1·17 1·081·27 p0·0001, and patients aged 50 years and older with chronic pulmonary disease with or without asthma were significantly less likely than those without a respiratory condition to receive critical care adjusted OR 0·66 0·600·72 for those without asthma and 0·74 0·620·87 for those with asthma p0·0001 for both In patients aged 1649 years, only those with severe asthma had a significant increase in mortality compared to those with no asthma adjusted hazard ratio HR 1·17 95 CI 0·731·86 for those on no asthma therapy, 0·99 0·611·58 for those on SABAs only, 0·94 0·621·43 for those on inhaled corticosteroids only, 1·02 0·671·54 for those on inhaled corticosteroids plus LABAs, and 1·96 1·253·08 for those with severe asthma Among patients aged 50 years and older, those with chronic pulmonary disease had a significantly increased mortality risk, regardless of inhaled corticosteroid use, compared to patients without an underlying respiratory condition adjusted HR 1·16 95 CI 1·121·22 for those not on inhaled corticosteroids, and 1·10 1·041·16 for those on inhaled corticosteroids p0·0001 Patients aged 50 years and older with severe asthma also had an increased mortality risk compared to those not on asthma therapy adjusted HR 1·24 95 CI 1·041·49 In patients aged 50 years and older, inhaled corticosteroid use within 2 weeks of hospital admission was associated with decreased mortality in those with asthma, compared to those without an underlying respiratory condition adjusted HR 0·86 95 CI 0·800·92 INTERPRETATION Underlying respiratory conditions are common in patients admitted to hospital with COVID19 Regardless of the severity of symptoms at admission and comorbidities, patients with asthma were more likely, and those with chronic pulmonary disease less likely, to receive critical care than patients without an underlying respiratory condition In patients aged 16 years and older, severe asthma was associated with increased mortality compared to nonsevere asthma In patients aged 50 years and older, inhaled corticosteroid use in those with asthma was associated with lower mortality than in patients without an underlying respiratory condition patients with chronic pulmonary disease had significantly increased mortality compared to those with no underlying respiratory condition, regardless of inhaled corticosteroid use Our results suggest that the use of inhaled corticosteroids, within 2 weeks of admission, improves survival for patients aged 50 years and older with asthma, but not for those with chronic pulmonary disease FUNDING

effects, the most serious of which is pulmonary toxicity A 79yearold man presented with respiratory failure due to interstitial pneumonia during coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic The viral etiology was nevertheless excluded by repeated nasopharyngeal swabs and serological tests and the final diagnosis was amiodarone induced organizing pneumonia The clinical and computed tomography findings improved after amiodarone interruption and steroid therapy Even during a pandemic, differential diagnosis should always be consideredxa0and pulmonary toxicity has to be taken into account in any patient taking amiodarone and who has new respiratory symptoms,SARSCoV2 infection or COVID19 has become a worldwide pandemic however, effective treatment for COVID19 remains to be established Along with acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS, new and old cardiovascular injuries are important causes of significant morbidity and mortality in COVID19 Exploring new approaches managing cardiovascular complications is essential in controlling the disease progression and preventing longterm complications Oxytocin OXT, an immuneregulating neuropeptide, has recently emerged as a strong candidate for treatment and prevention of COVID19 pandemic OXT carries special functions in immunologic defense, homeostasis and surveillance It suppresses neutrophil infiltration and inflammatory cytokine release, activates Tlymphocytes, and antagonizes negative effects of angiotensin II and other key pathological events of COVID19 Additionally, OXT can promote γinterferon expression to inhibit cathepsin L and increases superoxide dismutase expression to reduce heparin and heparan sulphate fragmentation Through these mechanisms, OXT can block viral invasion, suppress cytokine storm, reverse lymphocytopenia, and prevent progression to ARDS and multiple organ failures Importantly, besides prevention of metabolic disorders associated with atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus, OXT can protect the heart and vasculature through suppressing hypertension and brainheart syndrome, and promoting regeneration of injured cardiomyocytes Unlike other therapeutic agents, exogenous OXT can be used safely without the sideeffects seen in remdesivir and corticosteroid Importantly, OXT can be mobilized endogenously to prevent pathogenesis of COVID19 This article summarizes our current understandings of cardiovascular pathogenesis caused by COVID19, explores the protective potentials of OXT against COVID19associated cardiovascular diseases, and discusses challenges in applying OXT in treatment and prevention of COVID19 CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2 atrial natriuretic peptide ANP cathepsin L heparan sulphate proteoglycans HSPGs interferon interleukin

singlestranded RNA, enveloped virus from the beta Coronavirus family Intraoperative management of patients with COVID19 is a highrisk procedure An international attention has raised to develop recommendations for the management strategies This review article was designed to synthesize the existing evidence and experience related to intraoperative management of COVID19 This review provides a summary of clinical guidance and addresses six domains principles of intraoperative monitoring, airway management and related difficulties, ventilation, type of anesthesia, medications and side effects, and intraoperative fluid management,Antiplatelet medications comprise the cornerstone of treatment for diseases that involve arterial thrombosis, including acute coronary syndromes ACS, stroke and peripheral arterial disease However, antiplatelet medications may cause bleeding and, furthermore, thrombotic events may still recur despite treatment The interaction of collagen with GPVI receptors on the surface of platelets has been identified as one of the major players in the pathophysiology of arterial thrombosis that occurs following atherosclerotic plaque rupture Promisingly, GPVI deficiency in humans appears to have a minimal impact on bleeding These findings together suggest that targeting platelet GPVI may provide a novel treatment strategy that provides additional antithrombotic efficacy with minimal disruption of normal hemostasis compared to conventional antiplatelet medications CLEC2 is gaining interest as a therapeutic target for a variety of thromboinflammatory disorders including deep vein thrombosis DVT with treatment also predicted to cause minimal disruption to hemostasis GPVI and CLEC2 signal through Src, Syk and Tec family tyrosine kinases, providing additional strategies for inhibiting both receptors In this review, we summarize the evidence regarding GPVI and CLEC2 and strategies for inhibiting these receptors to inhibit platelet recruitment and activation in thrombotic diseases,Although COVID19 is viewed primarily as a respiratory disease, cardiovascular risk factors and disease are prevalent among infected patients and are associated with worse outcomes In addition, among multiple extrapulmonary manifestations, there has been an increasing recognition of specific cardiovascular complications of COVID19 Despite this, in the initial stages of the pandemic there was evidence of a reduction in patients presenting to acute cardiovascular services In this masterclass review, with the aid of 2 exemplar cases, we will focus on the important therapeutic implications of COVID19 for interventional cardiologists We summarize the existing evidence base regarding the varied cardiovascular presentations seen in COVID19 positive patients and the prognostic importance and potential mechanisms of acute myocardial injury in this setting Importantly, through the use of a systematic review of the literature, we focus our discussion on the observed higher rates of coronary thrombus burden in patients with COVID19 and acute coronary syndromes,Thrombosis has emerged as an important complication of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19, particularly among individuals with severe illness However, the precise incidence of thrombotic events remains uncertain due to differences in study design, patient populations, outcome ascertainment, event definitions, and reporting In an effort to overcome some of these challenges and promote standardized data collection and reporting in clinical studies, the American Society of Hematology Research Collaborative COVID19 NonMalignant Hematology Task Force, in collaboration with the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis COVID19 Task Force, developed sets of data elements in the following domains venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, stroketransient ischemic attack, peripheral arterial thrombosis, bleeding, laboratory investigations, and antithrombotic therapy Data elements in each of these domains were developed with 3 levels of detail to facilitate their incorporation into studies evaluating a range of interventions and outcomes Previously published data elements were included where possible The use of standardized variables in a range of clinical studies can enhance the quality of data collection, create efficiency, enhance comparison of results across studies, and facilitate future pooling of data sets,Objective To describe the characteristics and prognosis of patients with COPD admitted to the hospital due to SARSCoV2 infection Methods The SEMICOVID registry is an ongoing retrospective cohort comprising consecutive COVID19 patients hospitalized in Spain since the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020 Data on demographics, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, laboratory tests, radiology, treatment, and progress are collected Patients with COPD were selected and compared to patients without COPD Factors associated with a poor prognosis were analyzed Results Of the 10,420 patients included in the SEMICOVID registry as of May 21, 2020, 746 716 had a diagnosis of COPD Patients with COPD are older than those without COPD 77 years vs 68 years and more frequently male They have more comorbidities hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, kidney failure and a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index 2 vs 1, p0001 The mortality rate in COPD patients was 383 compared to 192 in patients without COPD p0001 Male sex, a history of hypertension, heart failure, moderatesevere chronic kidney disease, presence of cerebrovascular disease with sequelae, degenerative neurological disease, dementia, functional dependence, and a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index have been associated with increased mortality due to COVID19 in COPD patients Survival was higher among patients with COPD who were treated with hydroxychloroquine 871 vs 749, p0001 and with macrolides 579 vs 50, p0037 Neither prone positioning nor noninvasive mechanical ventilation, highflow nasal cannula, or invasive mechanical ventilation were associated with a better prognosis Conclusion COPD patients admitted to the hospital with SARSCoV2 infection have more severe disease and a worse prognosis than nonCOPD patients,AIMS AND OBJECTIVES To investigate the factors associated with the exacerbations of COVID19 BACKGROUND At present, COVID19 is prevalent in the world, seriously endangering the property and life safety of people around the world Currently, there are many reports on the clinical features, complications and risk factors of death of COVID19, but there are few reports on the factors associated with the exacerbation of COVID19 DESIGN Casecontrol Study METHODS Patients with COVID19 were recruited from four designated hospitals for novel coronavirus pneumonia in Xiangyang City, Hubei Province from January to April 2020 The patients were divided into disease exacerbation group nxa0xa053 and disease stabilisation group nxa0xa0265 according to the disease progression during hospitalisation Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were used to identify the factors associated with the exacerbation of COVID19 The research was reported according to STROBE statement RESULTS Univariate analysis showed there were significant differences in gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, kidney disease, white blood cell count, percentage of neutrophil, percentage of lymphocyte, Creactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, total protein, albumin, creatinine, calcium ion, rate of erythrocyte sedimentation, cough, expectoration, chest tightness, gastrointestinal discomfort and dyspnoea between the two groups The variables with p,Extracellular vesicles EVs have emerged as a potential therapy for several diseases These plasma membranederived fragments are released constitutively by virtually all cell typesincluding mesenchymal stromal cells MSCsunder stimulation or following celltocell interaction, which leads to activation or inhibition of distinct signaling pathways Based on their size, intracellular origin, and secretion pathway, EVs have been grouped into three main populations exosomes, microvesicles or microparticles, and apoptotic bodies Several molecules can be found inside MSCderived EVs, including proteins, lipids, mRNA, microRNAs, DNAs, as well as organelles that can be transferred to damaged recipient cells, thus contributing to the reparative process and promoting relevant antiinflammatoryresolutive actions Indeed, the paracrineendocrine actions induced by MSCderived EVs have demonstrated therapeutic potential to mitigate or even reverse tissue damage, thus raising interest in the regenerative medicine field, particularly for lung diseases In this review, we summarize the main features of EVs and the current understanding of the mechanisms of action of MSCderived EVs in several lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD, pulmonary infections including coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19, asthma, acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis IPF, and cystic fibrosis CF, among others Finally, we list a number of limitations associated with this therapeutic strategy that must be overcome in order to translate effective EVbased therapies into clinical practice,We proposed a combined cardiothoracicMRI CaThMRI protocol for the comprehensive assessment of cardiovascular structures, lung parenchyma, and pulmonary arterial tree, in COVID19 patients with progressive worsening of clinical conditions andor suspicion of acuteonset myocardial inflammation A 25minutes fast protocol was also conceived for unstable or uncooperative patients by restricting the number of sequences to those necessary to rule out myocardial and to assess pulmonary involvement In patients requiring CMR characterization of myocardial damage, the addition of lung and thoracic vessel evaluation is of clinical benefit at a minimal time expense,Endothelial injury by toxins, drugs, immune complexes leads to activation of coagulation cascade and thrombosis, which result in platelet consumption and red blood cell injury These thrombotic microangiopathies can potentially injure numerous organs and result in organ dysfunction In this case, we present the fourth reported patient with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura associated with COVID19,PURPOSE To investigate whether minimum intensity projection MinIP reconstructions enable more accurate depiction of pulmonary groundglass opacity GGO compared to standard transverse sections and multiplanar reformat MPR series in patients with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 METHOD In this multinational study, chest CT scans of 185 patients were retrospectively analyzed Diagnostic accuracy, diagnostic confidence, image quality regarding the assessment of GGO, as well as subjective timeefficiency of MinIP and standard MPR series were analyzed based on the assessment of six radiologists In addition, the suitability for COVID19 evaluation, image quality regarding GGO and subjective timeefficiency in clinical routine was assessed by five clinicians RESULTS The reference standard revealed a total of 149 CT scans with pulmonary GGO MinIP reconstructions yielded significantly higher sensitivity 999  vs 956 , specificity 958  vs 861  and accuracy 991  vs 938  for assessing of GGO compared with standard MPR series MinIP reconstructions achieved significantly higher ratings by radiologists concerning diagnostic confidence medians, 500 vs 400, image quality medians, 400 vs 400, contrast between GGO and unaffected lung parenchyma medians, 500 vs 400 as well as subjective timeefficiency medians, 500 vs 400 compared with MPRseries all P  001 Clinicians preferred MinIP reconstructions for COVID19 assessment medians, 500 vs 300, image quality regarding GGO medians, 500 vs 300 and subjective timeefficiency in clinical routine medians, 500 vs 300 CONCLUSIONS MinIP reconstructions improve the assessment of COVID19 in chest CT compared to standard images and may be suitable for routine application,During the COVID19 pandemic, the emergence of a new condition with hyperinflammatory shock, resembling Kawasaki disease KD, was reported in children from Western countries strongly affected by SARSCoV2 This syndrome was termed paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARSCoV2 infection PIMSTS Despite displaying features similar to KD, studies demonstrated a new and more severe disease entity with multiorgan involvement, in particular gastrointestinal symptoms and heart failure, with blood tests consistent with a postinfectious inflammatory condition as summarised in this review,We present a case of a fatal cerebral haemorrhage in an 82yearold male patient with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19, who was taking prophylactic oral anticoagulation because of atrial fibrillation rivaroxaban 20 mg qd for two years On admission, the patient was deeply comatose, mechanically ventilated, with tachycardia up to 150 bpm, high blood pressure 210120 mmHg and a body temperature 39°C A computed tomography scan of the head showed a large intracerebral haemorrhage located in the deep structures of the right hemisphere, with a mass effect and bleeding to the ventricles Rivaroxaban was discontinued at admission The patient tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2, but he did not have typical symptoms of pneumonia In the following days, the patients neurological condition did not improve, and a fever of up to 40°C and abnormal coagulation parameters remained resistant to pharmacotherapy The patient developed multisystem organ failure and died on day 8 Here, we review the recent literature and discuss the possible association of SARSCoV2mediated endothelial injury and cardiovascular disorders with cerebrovascular complications We postulate that antiinflammatory treatment in COVID19 and the stabilisation of endothelium functions can be particularly important in patients with preexisting cardiovascular conditions,,The coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic is axa0challenge for our healthcare system but at the same time is one of the excellent catalyzers and promoters of successful translational research The COVID19 is not only axa0simple viral infection of the bronchial system but is also a pandemic hyperinflammatory multiorgan disease The cardiovascular system plays a causal role in this context, as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 invades host cells via the angiotensinconverting enzymexa02 ACE2, an enzyme in the reninangiotensin system Furthermore, cardiovascular comorbidities and risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity play an important role in the severity of the course of the disease Additional risk factors, such as gender, age, genetics and air pollution modulate both the severity of the SARSCoV‑2 infection as well as cardiovascular diseases As sequelae of COVID19, increased thrombosis, myocardial infarction, myocardial inflammation and vasculitis occur, which directly damage the cardiovascular system and substantially contribute to the high morbidity and mortality Knowledge gained from many studies on the course of the disease in patients infected with SARSCoV‑2 has led to improved treatment possibilities, which now in the second wave are partly standardized and were, and are, in particular adapted to complications of the cardiovascular system In this review we provide axa0short overview on the pathophysiology of the SARSCoV‑2 in general and also specifically on the cardiovascular system Furthermore, we summarize the current treatment approaches and their pathophysiological principles status November 2020,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 is a respiratory tract virus that causes Coronavirus disease COVID19 The virus originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has spread across the globe todate The disease ranges from asymptomatic carriers to symptoms such as fever, sore throat, cough, lung infections, and in severe cases, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and death As many as 50 of patients reported having at least one comorbidities with COVID19 upon hospital admission Hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases are among the most commonly reported Comorbidities are contributing to acute disease prognosis and increased risk of severe symptoms Around 70 of patients who require ICU care have been observed to have comorbidities This review intends to understand how some of these comorbidities affect the diseases prognosis and how severe the outcome can be expected,OBJECTIVE This study investigated the impact of the Webinar on deep human learning of CHD MATERIALS AND METHODS This crosssectional survey design study used an open and closedended questionnaire to assess the impact of the Webinar on deep learning of topical areas within the management of the postoperative tetralogy of Fallot patients This was a quantitative research methodology using descriptive statistical analyses with a sequential explanatory design RESULTS One thousandthreehundred and seventyfour participants from 100 countries on 6 continents joined the Webinar, 557 40 of whom completed the questionnaire Over 70 of participants reported that they agreed or strongly agreed that the Webinar format promoted deep learning for each of the topics compared to other standard learning methods textbook and journal learning Twothirds expressed a preference for attending a Webinar rather than an international conference Over 80 of participants highlighted significant barriers to attending conferences including cost 79, distance to travel 49, time commitment 51, and family commitments 35 Strengths of the Webinar included expertise, concise highquality presentations often discussing contentious issues, and the platform quality The main weakness was a limited time for questions Just over 53 expressed a concern for the carbon footprint involved in attending conferences and preferred to attend a Webinar CONCLUSION Elearning Webinars represent a disruptive innovation, which promotes deep learning, greater multidisciplinary participation, and greater attendee satisfaction with fewer barriers to participation Although Webinars will never fully replace conferences, a hybrid approach may reduce the need for conferencing, reduce carbon footprint and promote a sustainable academia,,COVID19 patients often develop severe cardiovascular complications, but it remains unclear if these are caused directly by viral infection or are secondary to a systemic response Here, we examine the cardiac tropism of SARSCoV2 in human pluripotent stem cellderived cardiomyocytes hPSCCMs and smooth muscle cells hPSCSMCs We find that that SARSCoV2 selectively infects hPSCCMs through the viral receptor ACE2, whereas in hPSCSMCs there is minimal viral entry or replication After entry into cardiomyocytes, SARSCoV2 is assembled in lysosomelike vesicles and egresses via bulk exocytosis The viral transcripts become a large fraction of cellular mRNA while host gene expression shifts from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism and upregulates chromatin modification and RNA splicing pathways Most importantly, viral infection of hPSCCMs progressively impairs both their electrophysiological and contractile function, and causes widespread cell death These data support the hypothesis that COVID19related cardiac symptoms can result from a direct cardiotoxic effect of SARSCoV2,AIMS The aim of the present paper was to provide an uptodate view on epidemiology and risk factors of heart failure HF development after myocardial infarction METHODS AND RESULTS Based on literature review, several clinical risk factors and biochemical, genetic, and imaging biomarkers were identified to predict the risk of HF development after myocardial infarction CONCLUSIONS Heart failure is still a frequent complication of myocardial infarction Timely identification of subjects at risk for HF development using a multimodality approach, and early initiation of guidelinedirected HF therapy in these patients, can decrease the HF burden,,The genetic factors that determine a patients risk for developing the acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS remain understudied In this issue of the JCI, Reilly and colleagues analyzed data from three cohorts of critically ill patients and observed an association between the ABO allele A1 and the onset of moderatesevere ARDS This association was most notable in patients with nonpulmonary sepsis an indirect, vasculaturetargeted mechanism of lung injury and persisted in patients who lacked epithelial expression of the A antigen, suggesting an endothelial mechanism of A1associated ARDS susceptibility Critically ill patients with blood type A had increased circulating concentrations of endotheliumderived glycoproteins such as von Willebrand factor and soluble thrombomodulin, and marginal lungs from blood type A donors were less likely to recover function during ex vivo perfusion These findings implicate A antigen glycosylation of endothelial cells as a critical, genetically determined risk factor for indirect lung injury that may contribute to the mechanistic heterogeneity of ARDS,Our aim was to assess the prevalence of unknown atrial fibrillation AF among adults during singletime point rhythm screening performed during meetings or social recreational activities organized by patient groups or volunteers A total of 2814 subjects median age 68 years underwent AF screening by a handheld singlelead ECG device MyDiagnostick Overall, 56 subjects 20 were diagnosed with AF, as a result of 12lead ECG following a positivesuspected recording Screening identified AF in 29 of the subjects  65 years None of the 265 subjects aged below 50 years was found positive at AF screening Risk stratification for unknown AF based on a CHA2DS2VASc  0 in males and 1 in females or CHA2DS2VA  0 had a high sensitivity 982 and a high negative predictive value 998 for AF detection A slightly lower sensitivity 964 was achieved by using age  65 years as a risk stratifier Conversely, raising the threshold at 75 years showed a low sensitivity Within the subset of subjects aged  65 a CHA2DS2VASc  1 in males and 2 in females, or a CHA2DS2VA  1 had a high sensitivity 944 and negative predictive value 993, while age  75 was associated with a marked drop in sensitivity for AF detection,Cognitive bias consists of systematic errors in thinking due to human processing limitations or inappropriate mental models Cognitive bias occurs when intuitive thinking is used to reach conclusions about information rather than analyticxa0mindful thinking Scientific progress is delayed when bias influences the dissemination of new scientific knowledge, as it has with the role of human leucocyte antigen antibodies and antibodymediated rejection in cardiac transplantation Mitigating strategies can be successful but involve concerted action by investigators, peer reviewers, andxa0editors to consider how we think as well as what we think,OBJECTIVES Groundglass opacity and consolidation are recognized typical features of Coronavirus disease19 COVID19 pneumonia on Chest CT, yet ancillary findings have not been fully described We aimed to describe ancillary findings of COVID19 pneumonia on CT, to define their prevalence, and investigate their association with clinical data METHODS We retrospectively reviewed our CT chest cases with coupled reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rtPCR Patients with negative rtPCR or without admission chest CT were excluded Ancillary findings included vessel enlargement, subpleural curvilinear lines, dependent subpleural atelectasis, centrilobular solid nodules, pleural andor pericardial effusions, enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes Continuous data were expressed as median and 95 confidence interval 95u2009CI and tested by MannWhitney U test RESULTS Ancillary findings were represented by 106252 421, 361 to 482 vessel enlargement, 50252 198, 154 to 252 subpleural curvilinear lines, 26252 101, 71 to 147 dependent subpleural atelectasis, 15252 59, 36 to 96 pleural effusion, 15252 59, 36 to 96 mediastinal lymph nodes enlargement, 13252 52, 3 to 86 centrilobular solid nodules, and 6252 24, 11 to 51 pericardial effusion Air space disease was more extensive in patients with vessel enlargement or centrilobular solid nodules p  0001 Vessel enlargement was associated with longer history of fever p  0035 and lower admission oxygen saturation p  0014 dependent subpleural atelectasis with lower oxygen saturation p  0001 and higher respiratory rate p  0001 mediastinal lymph nodes with shorter history of cough p  0046 centrilobular solid nodules with lower prevalence of cough p  0023, lower oxygen saturation p  0001, and higher respiratory rate p  0032, and pericardial effusion with shorter history of cough p  0015 Ancillary findings associated with longer hospital stay were subpleural curvilinear lines p  002, whereas centrilobular solid nodules were associated with higher rate of intensive care unit admission p  001 CONCLUSION Typical highresolution CT findings of COVID19 pneumonia are frequently associated with ancillary findings that variably associate with disease extent, clinical parameters, and disease severity ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE Ancillary findings might reflect the broad range of heterogeneous mechanisms in severe acute respiratory syndrome from viral pneumonia, and potentially help disease phenotyping,Clinical syndrome coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 is characterized by rapid spreading and high mortality worldwide While the pathology is not yet fully understood, hyperinflammatory response and coagulation disorders leading to congestions of microvessels are considered to be key drivers of the still increasing death toll Until now, physical changes of blood cells have not been considered to play a role in COVID19 related vascular occlusion and organ damage Here we report an evaluation of multiple physical parameters including the mechanical features of five frequent blood cell types, namely erythrocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils More than 4 million blood cells of 17 COVID19 patients at different levels of severity, 24 volunteers free from infectious or inflammatory diseases, and 14 recovered COVID19 patients were analyzed We found significant changes in erythrocyte deformability, lymphocyte stiffness, monocyte size, and neutrophil size and deformability While some of these changes recovered to normal values after hospitalization, others persisted for months after hospital discharge, evidencing the longterm imprint of COVID19 on the body,COVID19 related Acute Respiratory Failure, may be successfully treated with Conventional Oxygen therapy, High Flow Nasal Cannula, Continuous Positive Airway Pressure or Bilevel PositivePressure ventilation Despite the accumulated data in favor of the use of different Noninvasive Respiratory therapies in COVID19 related Acute Respiratory Failure, it is not fully understood when start, escalate and deescalate the best respiratory supportive option for the different timing of the disease Based on the current published experience with Noninvasive Respiratory therapies in COVID19 related Acute Respiratory Failure, we propose an algorithm in deciding when to start, when to stop and when to wean different NIRT This strategy may help clinicians in better choosing NIRT during this second COVID19 wave and beyond,Importance Influenza is temporally associated with cardiopulmonary morbidity and mortality among those with cardiovascular disease who may mount a less vigorous immune response to vaccination Higher influenza vaccine dose has been associated with reduced risk of influenza illness Objective To evaluate whether highdose trivalent influenza vaccine compared with standarddose quadrivalent influenza vaccine would reduce allcause death or cardiopulmonary hospitalization in highrisk patients with cardiovascular disease Design, Setting, and Participants Pragmatic multicenter, doubleblind, active comparator randomized clinical trial conducted in 5260 participants vaccinated for up to 3 influenza seasons in 157 sites in the US and Canada between September 21, 2016, and January 31, 2019 Patients with a recent acute myocardial infarction or heart failure hospitalization and at least 1 additional risk factor were eligible Interventions Participants were randomly assigned to receive highdose trivalent nu2009u20092630 or standarddose quadrivalent nu2009u20092630 inactivated influenza vaccine and could be revaccinated for up to 3 seasons Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the time to the composite of allcause death or cardiopulmonary hospitalization during each enrolling season The final date of followup was July 31, 2019 Vaccinerelated adverse events were also assessed Results Among 5260 randomized participants mean SD age, 655 126 years 3787 72 men 3289 63 with heart failure over 3 influenza seasons, there were 7154 total vaccinations administered and 5226 994 participants completed the trial In the highdose trivalent vaccine group, there were 975 primary outcome events 883 hospitalizations for cardiovascular or pulmonary causes and 92 deaths from any cause among 884 participants during 3577 participantseasons event rate, 45 per 100 patientyears, whereas in the standarddose quadrivalent vaccine group, there were 924 primary outcome events 846 hospitalizations for cardiovascular or pulmonary causes and 78 deaths from any cause among 837 participants during 3577 participantseasons event rate, 42 per 100 patientyears hazard ratio, 106 95 CI, 097117 Pu2009u200921 In the highdose vs standarddose groups, vaccinerelated adverse reactions occurred in 1449 405 vs 1229 344 participants and severe adverse reactions occurred in 55 21 vs 44 17 participants Conclusions and Relevance In patients with highrisk cardiovascular disease, highdose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, compared with standarddose quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, did not significantly reduce allcause mortality or cardiopulmonary hospitalizations Influenza vaccination remains strongly recommended in this population Trial Registration ClinicalTrialsgov Identifier NCT02787044,The development of an obstructive luminal thrombus is pathological and considered a failure of endogenous fibrinolysis The consequences may be fatal, or result in lasting downstream organ damage Therefore, assessment of endogenous fibrinolytic status in an individual may identify those at risk of occlusive thrombus formation and provide prognostic information Arterial thrombi are more platelet rich and more resistant to fibrinolysis than venous thrombi Several recent studies using global tests of fibrinolysis in patients with acute coronary syndromes ACS have shown that despite dual antiplatelet therapy, patients with impaired fibrinolytic status have an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events, compared with those with effective fibrinolytic function Such data add significantly to the predictive value of established cardiovascular risk factors and conventional biomarkers Most data reported have been obtained with the Global Thrombosis Test and the turbidimetric plasma clot lysis assay A few small studies in patients with ischaemic stroke suggest a similar predictive role of fibrinolytic status assessment in these patients Studies reporting an association between impaired fibrinolysis and future venous thrombotic events are limited, and in the form of casecontrol studies Viscoelastic assays may have a role in the prediction of venous thromboembolic risk Assays of fibrinolytic function should be used to obtain a more accurate risk of future thrombotic events, particularly in the setting of ACS The availability of pointofcare tests helps facilitate this and should encourage future studies to assess personalised antithrombotic treatment combinations to optimise fibrinolytic status and reduce thrombosis risk,SARSCoV2 infection of the respiratory system can evolve to a multisystem disease Excessive levels of proinflammatory cytokines, known as a cytokine storm are associated with high mortality rates especially in the elderly and in patients with agerelated morbidities Senescent cells, characterized by secretion of such cytokines Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype  SASP, are known to occur in this context as well as upon a variety of stressogenic insults Applying both i a novel in house antibody against the spike protein of SARSCoV2 and ii a unique senescence detecting methodology, we identified for the first time in lung tissue from COVID19 patients alveolar cells acquiring senescent features harboring also SARSCoV2 Moreover, using the same detection workflow we demonstrated the inflammatory properties of these cells Our findings justify the application of senotherapeutics for the treatment or prevention of COVID19 patients,RATIONALE Health outcomes of people with COVID19 range from no symptoms to severe illness and death Asthma, a common chronic lung disease, has been considered likely to increase the severity of COVID19, although data addressing this hypothesis have been scarce until very recently OBJECTIVES To review the epidemiologic literature related to asthmas potential role in COVID19 severity METHODS Studies were identified through the PubMed and medRxiv databases using the searchterms asthma, SARSCov2, and COVID19, and by crossreferencing citations in identified studies that were available in print or online before December 22, 2020 MEASUREMENTS Asthma prevalence data were obtained from studies of people with COVID19 and regional health statistics MAIN RESULTS We identified 147 studies worldwide that allowed us to compare the prevalence of asthma in patients with COVID19 by region, disease severity and mortality The results of our analyses do not provide clear evidence of increased risk of COVID19 diagnosis, hospitalization or severity, due to asthma CONCLUSIONS These findings could provide some reassurance to people with asthma regarding its potential to increase their risk of severe morbidity from COVID19 This article is open access and

of disease severity, and current treatment regimens The clinical perspective was analyzed in light of potential immunopathogenesis and compared to other postinfectious and inflammatory illnesses of children affecting the heart In this paradigm, the evidence supports the importance of endothelial injury and activation of the IL1 pathway as a common determinant among MISC, Kawasaki disease, and Acute Rheumatic fever,BACKGROUND Efficacy of COVID19 convalescent plasma CCP is hypothesized to be associated with the concentration of neutralizing antibodies nAb to SARSCoV2 High capacity serologic assays detecting binding antibodies bAb have been developed nAb assays are not adaptable to highthroughput testing We sought to determine the effectiveness of using surrogate bAb signaltocutoff ratios SCo in predicting nAb titers using a pseudovirus reporter viral particle neutralization RVPN assay METHODS CCP donor serum collected by three US blood collectors was tested with a bAb assay Ortho Clinical Diagnostics VITROS AntiSARSCoV2 Total, CoV2T and a nAb RVPN assay Prediction effectiveness of various CoV2T SCo criteria was evaluated for RVPN nAb NT50 titers using receiver operating characteristics RESULTS Seven hundred and fiftythree CCPs were tested with median CoV2T SCo and NT50 of 712 of 5275 Proportions of donors with NT50 over target nAb titers were 86 180, 76 1160, and 62 1320 Increasing CoV2T SCo criterion reduced the sensitivity to predict NT50 titers, while specificity to identify those below increased As target NT50 titers increase, the CoV2T assay becomes less accurate as a predictor with a decline in positive predictive value and rise in negative predictive value CONCLUSION Selection of a clinically effective nAb titer will impact availability of CCP Product release with CoV2T assay SCo criterion must balance the risk of releasing products below target nAb titers with the cost of false negatives A twostep testing scheme may be optimal, with nAb testing on CoV2T samples with SCos below criterion,The increasing incidence of coronavirus disease 19 COVID19 and its polymorphic clinical manifestations due to local and systemic inflammation represent a high burden for many public health systems Multiple evidence revealed the interdependence between the presence of cardiovascular comorbidities and a severe course of COVID19, with heart failure HF being incriminated as an independent predictor of mortality Suppression of tumorigenicity2 ST2 has emerged as one of the most promising biomarkers in assessing the evolution and prognosis of patients with HF The uniqueness of ST2 is determined by its structural particularities Its transmembrane isoform exerts cardioprotective effects, while the soluble isoform sST2, which is detectable in serum, is associated with myocardial fibrosis and poor outcome in patients with HF Some recent data also suggested the potential role of sST2 as a marker of inflammation, while other studies highlighted it as a valuable prognostic factor in patients with COVID19 In this review, we summarized the pathways by which sST2 is related to myocardial injury and its connection to the severity of inflammation in patients with COVID19 Also, we reviewed possible perspectives of using it as a dual cardioinflammatory biomarker, for both early diagnosis, risk stratification and prognosis assessment of patients with concomitant HF and COVID19,OBJECTIVES Current knowledge of the pulmonary pathology of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is based largely on postmortem studies In most, the interval between disease onset and death is relatively short 1 month Information regarding lung pathology in patients who survive for longer periods is scant We describe the pathology in three patients with severe COVID19 who underwent antemortem examination of lung tissue at least 8 weeks after initial diagnosis METHODS We conducted a retrospective case series RESULTS The first patient developed acute respiratory failure and was started on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ECMO on day 21, with subsequent hemothorax Debridement day 38 showed extensive lung infarction with diffuse alveolar damage and Candida overgrowth The second patient developed acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation that did not improve despite ECMO Surgical lung biopsy on day 74 showed diffuse interstitial fibrosis with focal microscopic honeycomb change The third patient also required ECMO and underwent bilateral lung transplantation on day 126 The explanted lungs showed diffuse interstitial fibrosis with focal microscopic honeycomb change CONCLUSIONS This series provides histologic confirmation that complications of COVID19 after 8 weeks to 4 months of severe disease include lung infarction and diffuse interstitial fibrosis,OBJECTIVES Management of the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARSCoV2 challenges both scientists and physicians to rapidly develop, and urgently assess, effective diagnostic tests and therapeutic interventions The initial presentation of the disease in symptomatic patients is invariably respiratory, with dry cough being the main symptom, but an increasing number of reports reveal multiple organ involvement The aim of this review is to summarise the potential role of the reninangiotensin system activated phagocytes in the pathogenesis of COVID19 disease METHODS Data for this review were identified by searches of PubMed, and references from relevant articles using the search terms SARS, COVID19, reninangiotensinsystem, phagocyte, reactive free radical, antioxidant, ARDS, thrombosis, myocardial, ischaemia, reperfusion, microvascular, and ACE2 Abstracts and reports from meetings were not included in this work Only articles published in English between 1976 and 2020 were reviewed RESULTS The cellular target of SARS viruses is the angiotensin converting enzyme 2, a critical regulating protein in the reninangiotensin system The elimination of this enzyme by the viral spike protein results in excessive activation of phagocytes, migration into the tissues via the high endothelial venules, and an oxidative burst In the case of an overstimulated host immune response, not only devastating respiratory symptoms, but even systemic or multiorgan involvement may be observed CONCLUSION Earlystage medical interventions may assist in returning the exaggerated immune response to a normal range however, some therapeutic delay might result in excessive tissue damages, occasionally mimicking a systemic disease with a detrimental outcome,The coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19, due to SARSCoV2, is primarily a respiratory disease, causing in most severe cases lifethreatening acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS Cardiovascular involvement can also occur, such as thrombosis or myocarditis, generally associated with pulmonary lesions Little is known about SARSCoV2induced myocarditis We report the case of a 69yearold man suffering from a refractory cardiogenic shock, without significant lung involvement Prior to death, several nasopharyngeal swabs and distal bronchoalveolar lavage were sampled in order to perform RTPCR analyses for SARSCoV2RNA, which all gave negative results Autopsy showed coronary atherosclerosis, without acute complication Microscopic examination of the heart revealed the existence of an intense multifocal inflammatory infiltration, in both ventricles and septum, composed in its majority of macrophages and CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes CD4CD8 ratio 011 Immunohistochemistry for antiSARS nucleocapsid protein antibody was strongly positive in myocardial cells, but not in lung tissue RTPCR was realized on formalinfixed paraffinembedded lung and heart tissue blocks only heart tissue was positive for SARSCoV2 RNA In conclusion, this exhaustive postmortem pathological case study of fulminant myocarditis demonstrates the presence of SARSCoV2 RNA in heart tissue, without significant lung involvement Immunohistochemistry showed that the virus was specifically localized in cardiomyocytes and induced a strong cytotoxic T cells inflammatory response This case report thus gives new insight in the pathogenesis of SARSCoV2induced myocarditis and emphasizes on the importance and reliability of postmortem analyses in order to better understand the physiopathology of this worldwide spreading new viral disease,The exponential growth of commercial flights has resulted in an explosion of air travelers over the last few decades, including passengers with a wide range of cardiovascular conditions Notwithstanding the ongoing COVID19 pandemic that had set back the aviation industry for the next 12 years, air travel is expected to rebound fully by 2024 Guidelines and evidencebased recommendations for safe air travel in this group vary, and physicians often encounter situations where opinions and assessments on fitness for flights are sought This article aims to provide an updated suite of recommendations for the aeromedical disposition of passenger with common cardiovascular conditions, such as ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and common arrhythmias,of the progress in arrhythmias in 2020 RACE4 and ALLIN indicated that integrated nurseled care improves outcomes in AF patients3,4 The same was reported for early rhythm control therapy15 and cryoablation as initial AF treatment25,26 Subcutaneous ICD was noninferior to classical transvenous ICD therapy in PRAETORIAN54 One mechanistic study showed that autoantibodies against misexpressed actin, keratin, and connexin43 proteins create a bloodborne biomarker profile enhancing diagnosis of Brugada syndrome50 Another mechanistic study indicated that transseptal LV pacing yields similar improvement in contractility as His bundle pacing whilst being more easy to execute44 In PREDETERMINE a simpletouse ECG risk score

caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 COVID19 pneumonia has characteristic radiological features Recent evidence indicates usefulness of chest Xray and lung ultrasound LUS in detecting COVID19 pneumonia Materials and methods In this prospective observational study, chest Xray and LUS features of 50 adults with COVID19 pneumonia at the time of presentation were described Results Chest Xray findings were present in 96 of patients, whereas all patients have ultrasound finding Proportion 95 CI of patients having bilateral opacities in chest Xray was 96 865989, ground glass opacity 74 605841, and consolidation 50 367634 In LUS, shred sign and thickened pleura was present in all patients recruited in this study Air bronchogram was present in at least one area in 80 of all patients and Blines score of more than 2 was present in at least one lung area in 84 patients Number of lung areas with shred sign were higher in hypoxemic p  0005 and tachypneic p  0006 patients and pleura line abnormalities were present in more lung areas in hypoxemic patients p  003 Conclusion According to our study, LUS is a useful tool not only in diagnosing, but it also

kidney and neurological complications as well as thromboembolic phenomena of unclear pathogenesis 1 SARSCoV2 utilises the catalytic site of fulllength membranebound angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ACE2 for host cell entry 2, which is thought to downregulate membranebound ACE2, and thus contribute to ongoing inflammation due to loss of a degradative pathway for angiotensin II In healthy individuals, ACE2 exists primarily in its membranebound form with very low levels of the catalytically active ectodomain of ACE2 present in the circulation 3 However, in patients with cardiovascular disease, there is increased shedding of ACE2, and higher circulating levels are associated with downregulation of membranebound ACE2 4,AIMS This metaanalysis provides summary odds ratio OR estimates

hyperreactivity is important, as it is responsible for surging antiviral responses and the possible initiation of an amplified cytokine storm This biological condition is attributed to immune regulators encoded in chromosome 21 Moreover, DS is also characterized by the coexistence of obesity and cardiovascular and respiratory anomalies, which are risk factors for coronavirus disease COVID19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2Case presentationA total of 55 children were admitted to the pediatric ward in Bergamo, between February and May 2020 for COVID19 Here, we describe the cases of two children with DS and a confirmed COVID19 diagnosis who had a severe course In addition, both cases involved one or more comorbidities, including cardiovascular anomalies, obesity, andor obstructive sleep apneaConclusionsOur observations indicate that children with DS are at risk for severe COVID19 disease course,,Aims To assess cardiac safety in COVID19 patients treated with the combination of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin using arrhythmia risk management plan Methods and results We retrospectively examined arrhythmia safety of treatment with Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin in the setting of predefined arrhythmia risk management plan The data was analyzed using R statistical package version 400 A twotailed pvalue005 was considered significant 81 patients were included from March 23rd to May 10th 2020 The median age was 59xa0years, 580 were female The majority of the study population 827 had comorbidities, 988 had

health issue with suboptimal blood pressure BP control rates The aim of the trial is to evaluate the effectiveness and costeffectiveness of a multicomponent intervention MCI versus usual care on lowering BP among adults with uncontrolled hypertension visiting primary care clinics in Singapore This article describes the statistical analysis plan for the primary and secondary objectives related to intervention effectivenessMethodsThe study is a cluster randomized trial enrolling 1000 participants with uncontrolled hypertension aged u200940u2009years from eight primary care clinics in Singapore The unit of randomization is the clinic, with eight clusters clinics randomized in a 11 ratio to either MCI or usual care All participants will be assessed at baseline, 12u2009months, and 24u2009months with measurements of systolic and diastolic BP, antihypertensive and statin medication use, medication adherence, physical activity level, anthropometric parameters, smoking status, and dietary habitsThe primary objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of MCI versus usual care on mean SBP at the 2year followup The primary outcome is SBP at 24u2009monthsSBP at baseline, 12, and 24u2009months will be modeled at the subject level using a likelihoodbased, linear mixedeffects model repeated measures MMRM analysis with treatment group and followup as fixed effects, random

incorporating generalized techniques appropriate for the type of outcomeDiscussionThe trial will allow us to determine whether the MCI has an impact on BP and cardiovascular risk factors over a 2year followup period and inform recommendations for health planners in scaling up these strategies for the benefit of society at large A prespecified and prepublished statistical analysis plan mitigates reporting bias and data driven approachesTrial registrationClinicalTrialsgov NCT02972619 Registered on 23 November 2016,,Inorganic polyphosphate polyP is a widely distributed polymer found from bacteria to animals, including marine species This polymer exhibits morphogenetic as well as antiviral activity and releases metabolic energy after enzymatic hydrolysis also in human cells In the pathogenesis of the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19, the platelets are at the frontline of this syndrome Platelets release a set of molecules, among them polyP In addition, the production of airway mucus, the first line of body defense, is impaired in those patients Therefore, in this study, amorphous nanoparticles of the magnesium salt of polyP MgpolyPNP, matching the size of the coronavirus SARSCoV2, were prepared and loaded with the secondary plant metabolite quercetin or with dexamethasone to study their effects on the respiratory epithelium using human alveolar basal epithelial A549 cells as a model The results revealed that both compounds embedded into the polyP nanoparticles significantly increased the steadystateexpression of the MUC5AC gene This mucin species is the major mucus glycoprotein present in the secreted gelforming mucus The level of gene expression caused by quercetin or with dexamethasone, if caged into polyP NP, is significantly higher compared to the individual drugs alone Both quercetin and dexamethasone did not impair the growthsupporting effect of polyP on A549 cells even at concentrations of quercetin which are cytotoxic for the cells A possible mechanism of the effects of the two drugs together with polyP on mucin expression is proposed based on the scavenging of free oxygen species and the generation of ADPATP from the polyP, which is needed for the organization of the protective mucinbased mucus layer,BackgroundWe describe a frugal approach focusing on needs, performance, and costs to manage a massive influx of COVID19 patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure AHRF using the Boussignac valve protected by a filter Filter Frugal CPAP, FFCPAP in and out the ICUMethods1 A bench study measured the impact of two filters with different mechanical properties on CPAP performances, and pressures were also measured in patients 2 NonICU healthcare staff working in COVID19 intermediate care units were trained with a video tutorial posted on a massive open online course 3 A clinical study assessed the feasibility and safety of using FFCPAP to maintain oxygenation and manage patients out of the ICU during a massive outbreakResultsBench assessments showed that adding a filter did not affect the effective pressure delivered to the patient The resistive load induced by the filter variably increased the simulated patients work of breathing 634 needed to sustain the tidal volume, depending on the filters resistance, respiratory mechanics and basal inspiratory effort In patients, FFCPAP achieved pressures similar to those obtained on the bench The massive training tool provided precious information on the use of Boussignac FFCPAP on COVID19 patients Then 85 COVID19 patients with ICU admission criteria over a 1month period were studied upon FFCPAP initiation for AHRF FFCPAP significantly decreased respiratory rate and increased SpO2 Thirtysix 43 patients presented with respiratory indications for intubation prior to FFCPAP initiation, and 13 36 of them improved without intubation Overall, 31 patients 36 improved with FFCPAP alone and 17 patients 20 did not require ICU admission Patients with a respiratory rateu2009u200932 breathsmin upon FFCPAP initiation had a higher cumulative probability of intubation p,PurposeThis study was designed to evaluate the usefulness of lung ultrasound LUS imaging to characterize the progression and severity of lung damage in cases of COVID19MethodsWe employed a set of combined ultrasound parameters and histopathological images obtained simultaneously in 28 patients 15 women, 0683xa0years with fatal COVID19 submitted to minimally invasive autopsies, with different times of disease evolution from initial symptoms to death 337xa0days, median 18xa0days For each patient, we analysed eight postmortem LUS parameters and the proportion of three histological patterns normal lung, exudative diffuse alveolar damage DAD and fibroproliferative DAD in eight different lung regions The relationship between histopathological and postmortem ultrasonographic findings was assessed using various statistical approachesResultsStatistically significant positive correlations were observed between fibroproliferative DAD and peripheral consolidation coefficient 043, pu2009u2009002 and pulmonary consolidation coefficient 051, pu2009u20090005 A model combining age, time of evolution, sex and ultrasound score predicted reasonably well ru2009u2009066 the proportion of pulmonary parenchyma with fibroproliferative DADConclusionThe present study adds information to previous studies related to the use of LUS as a tool to assess the severity of acute pulmonary damage We provide a histological background that supports the concept that LUS can be used to characterize the progression and severity of lung damage in severe COVID19,Abstract Virus propagation methods generally use transformed cell lines to grow viruses from clinical specimens, which may force viruses to rapidly adapt to cell culture conditions, a process facilitated by high viral mutation rates Upon propagation in VeroE6 cells, SARSCoV2 may mutate or delete the multibasic cleavage site MBCS in the spike protein that facilitates serine proteasemediated entry into human airway cells We report that propagating SARSCoV2 on the human airway cell line Calu3  that expresses serine proteases  prevents MBCS mutations Similar results were obtained using a human airway organoidbased culture system for SARSCoV2 propagation Thus, indepth knowledge on the biology of a virus can be used to establish methods to prevent cell culture adaptation,BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is the current pandemic disease without any vaccine or efficient treatment to rescue the patients Underlying diseases predispose the patients to a more severe disease and to a higher mortality rate However, little evidence exists about COVID19 outcomes in the pediatric population with congenital heart disease CHD Here, we report nine children with COVID19 and concomitant CHDMethodsOur study included nine children with COVID19 and concomitant CHD who were admitted to Children Medical Center Hospital during March and April 2020 The patients were classified based on the final outcome death, and their clinical sign and symptoms, type of CHD, and drugs administered were comparedResultsAmong the nine patients, two died and we compared different characteristics, laboratory results and clinical findings of these cases based on the mortality The deceased patients had severe types of CHD, worse arterial blood gases, severe clinical symptoms, higher mean level of partial thromboplastin time and Creactive protein, and required more medicationsConclusionsThe present study showed that the general consideration of mild COVID19 in children does not include patients with CHD and that it is necessary to pay greater attention to children with CHD to determine guidelines for treatment of COVID19 in these children Owing to the scarcity of CHD and COVID19, we reported only nine cases However, further studies are highly required in this regard,The coronavirus

functional receptor on cell surfaces through which SARSCoV2 enters the host cells and is highly expressed in the heart, kidneys, and lungs and shed into the plasma ACE2 is a key regulator of the reninangiotensinaldosterone system RAAS SARSCoV2 causes ACEACE2 balance disruption and RAAS activation, which leads ultimately to COVID19 progression, especially in patients with comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease Therefore, ACE2 expression may have paradoxical effects, aiding SARSCoV2 pathogenicity, yet conversely limiting viral infection This article reviews the existing literature and knowledge of ACE2 in COVID19 setting and focuses on its pathophysiologic involvement in disease progression, clinical outcomes, and therapeutic potential,We

United States US and has recently become the leading cause of death amongst adults over 45 years of age Much of its clinical presentation is already known, and there have been advances in its successful treatment with axa0food and drug administration FDA approved antiviral medication called remdesivir,xa0and other proven investigational methods with clinical benefits includingxa0dexamethasone and COVID19 antibody transfusion called convalescent plasma therapy However, the recommendations for their usexa0include COVID19 confirmed patients requiring supplemental oxygen or other forms of respiratory support In this case report, we describe in detail a unique case of severe COVID19 infection that did not require any form of oxygen support but wasxa0treated successfully with antiviral medications and steroids The purpose of this report is to highlight in detail an unusual COVID19 presentationxa0with rhabdomyolysis, myocarditis, and pancytopeniaxa0severe enough to require hospitalization and treatment with proven COVID19 therapy to achieve clinical resolution,,The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2, has brought into focus the key role of angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2, which serves as a cell surface receptor required for the virus to enter cells SARSCoV2 can decrease cell surface ACE2 directly by internalization of ACE2 bound to the virus and indirectly by increased ADAM17 a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17mediated shedding of ACE2 ACE2 is widely expressed in the heart, lungs, vasculature, kidney and the gastrointestinal GI tract, where it counteracts the deleterious effects of angiotensin II AngII by catalyzing the conversion of AngII into the vasodilator peptide angiotensin17 Ang17 The downregulation of ACE2 by SARSCoV2 can be detrimental to the cardiovascular system and kidneys Further, decreased ACE2 can cause gut dysbiosis, inflammation and potentially worsen the systemic inflammatory response and coagulopathy associated with SARSCoV2 This review aims to elucidate the crucial role of ACE2 both as a regulator of the reninangiotensin system and a receptor for SARSCoV2 as well as the implications for Coronavirus disease 19 and its associated cardiovascular and renal complications,,Creactive protein CRP is the bestknown acute phase protein In humans, almost every type of inflammation is accompanied by an increase of CRP concentration Until recently, the only known physiological function of CRP was the marking of cells to initiate their phagocytosis This triggers the classical complement pathway up to C4, which helps to eliminate pathogens and dead cells However, vital cells with reduced energy supply are also marked, which is useful in the case of a classical external wound because an important substrate for pathogens is disposed of, but is counterproductive at internal wounds eg, heart attack or stroke This mechanism negatively affects clinical outcomes since it is established that CRP levels correlate with the prognosis of these indications Here, we summarize what we can learn from a clinical study in which CRP was adsorbed from the bloodstream by CRPapheresis Recently, it was shown that CRP can have a direct effect on blood pressure in rabbits This is interesting in regard to patients with high inflammation, as they often become tachycardic and need catecholamines These two physiological effects of CRP apparently also occur in COVID19 Parts of the lung become ischemic due to intraalveolar edema and hemorrhage and in parallel CRP increases dramatically, hence it is assumed that CRP is also involved in this ischemic condition It is meanwhile considered that most of the damage in COVID19 is caused by the immune system The high amounts of CRP could have an additional influence on blood pressure in severe COVID19,BACKGROUND Cardiac manifestation of COVID19 has been reported during the COVID pandemic The role of cardiac arrhythmias in COVID19 is insufficiently understood This study assesses the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias and their prognostic implications in hospitalized COVID19patients METHODS A total of 166 patients from eight centers who were hospitalized for COVID19 from 032020062020 were included Medical records were systematically analyzed for baseline characteristics, biomarkers, cardiac arrhythmias and clinical outcome parameters related to the index hospitalization Predisposing risk factors for arrhythmias were identified Furthermore, the influence of arrhythmia on the course of disease and related outcomes was assessed using univariate and multiple regression analyses RESULTS Arrhythmias were detected in 205 of patients Atrial fibrillation was the most common arrhythmia Age and cardiovascular disease were predictors for newonset arrhythmia Arrhythmia was associated with a pronounced increase in cardiac biomarkers, prolonged hospitalization, and admission to intensive or intermediatecareunits, mechanical ventilation and inhospital mortality In multiple regression analyses, incident arrhythmia was strongly associated with duration of hospitalization and mechanical ventilation Cardiovascular disease was associated with increased mortality CONCLUSIONS Arrhythmia was the most common cardiac event in association with hospitalization for COVID19 Older age and cardiovascular disease predisposed for arrhythmia during hospitalization Whereas inhospital mortality is affected by underlying cardiovascular conditions, arrhythmia during hospitalization for COVID19 is independently associated with prolonged hospitalization and mechanical ventilation Thus, incident arrhythmia may indicate a patient subgroup at risk for a severe course of disease,Spontaneous pneumomediastinum SPM and pneumothorax PNX unrelated to positive pressure ventilation has been recently reported as an unusual complication in cases of severe COVID19 pneumonia The presumed pathophysiological mechanism is diffuse alveolar injury leading to alveolar rupture and air leak We present a case of COVID19 pneumonia complicated on day 13 post admission by SPM, PNX and subcutaneous emphysema in a patient with no identifiable risk factors for such complication The patient received medical treatment for his COVID19 infection without the use of an invasive or noninvasive ventilator Moreover, he is a nonsmoker with no lung comorbidities and never reported a cough He was eventually discharged home in stable condition A comprehensive literature review revealed 15 cases of SPM developing in patients with COVID19 pneumonia,,Purpose of ReviewWireless hemodynamic monitoring in heart failure patients allows for volume assessment without the need for physical exam Data obtained from these devices is used to assist patient management and avoid heart failure hospitalizations In this review, we outline the various devices, mechanisms they utilize, and effects on heart failure patientsRecent FindingsNew applications of these devices to specific populations may expand the pool of patients that may benefit In the COVID19 pandemic with a growing emphasis on virtual visits, remote monitoring can add vital ancillary dataSummaryWireless hemodynamic monitoring with a pulmonary artery pressure sensor is a highly effective and safe method to assess for worsening intracardiac pressures that may predict heart failure events, giving lead time that is valuable to keep patients optimized Implantation of this device has been found to improve outcomes in heart failure patients regardless of preserved or reduced ejection fraction,Coronavirus disease Covid19 is caused by infection from the novel SARS CoV2 The higher potential of this virus to spread has caused a worldwide pandemic situation and a serious public health crisis 1  This case report aims to highlight the responses and benefits attained from physiotherapy management in COVID 19 patients at a dedicated tertiary care hospital with distinct characteristics and age group Today, India is in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic wherein all its healthcare workers are relentlessly fighting against the unseen enemy SARS CoV2 which was identified in the Wuhan city of China in December 2019 primarily affects the respiratory system causing abnormal pulmonary mechanics due to ventilation perfusion mismatch and  or intrapulmonary shunting This case series is an attempt to discuss various physiotherapeutic interventions administered to patients admitted in the wards of a government tertiary care hospital dedicated for Covid19 management and its benefits in enhancing recovery and function A written informed consent along with due consent of the patient for his pictorial representation was obtained This series describes the cases of four patients with varied characteristics and age who presented with complains of fever, dry cough and breathlessness in our COVID dedicated tertiary care hospital After ensuring stability in the overall health condition of the patients, physiotherapy intervention was planned for these patients with emphasis on patient education and positioning strategies All the four patients presented with symptoms of fever, dry cough and breathlessness in common leading to a clinical diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infection LRTI Case 2 also complained of fatigue and weakness On observation, the patients had increased work of breathing with abnormal breathing pattern which led to breathlessness Patients showed decreased oxygen saturation when measured with pulse oximeter indicative of ventilationperfusion mismatch,,The subpleural sparing pattern is a common finding on computed tomography CT of the lungs It comprises of pulmonary opacities sparing the lung peripheries, typically 1cm and less from the pleural surface This finding has a variety of causes, including idiopathic, inflammatory, infectious, inhalational, cardiac, traumatic, and bleeding disorders Specific disorders that can cause subpleural sparing patterns include nonspecific interstitial pneumonia NSIP, organizing pneumonia OP, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis PAP, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage DAH, vapingassociated lung injury VALI, cracked lung, pulmonary edema, pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia PJP, pulmonary contusion, and more recently, Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pneumonia Knowledge of the many etiologies of this pattern can be useful in preventing diagnostic errors In addition, although the etiology of subpleural sparing pattern is frequently indistinguishable during an initial radiologic evaluation, the differences in location of opacities in the lungs, as well as the presence of additional radiologic findings, patient history, and clinical presentation, can often be useful to suggest the appropriate diagnosis We did a comprehensive search on Pubmed and Google Scholar database using keywords of subpleural sparing, peripheral sparing, sparing of peripheries, CT chest, chest imaging, and pulmonary disease This review aims to describe the primary differential diagnosis of subpleural sparing pattern seen on chest imaging with a strong emphasis on clinical and radiographic findings We also discuss the pathogenesis and essential clues that are crucial to narrow the differential diagnosis,A 34yearold woman was seen in the emergency department for shortness of breath and chest pain During a pandemic, it is easy to think horses and not zebras, and with a patient presenting with the classic coronavirus symptoms it would have been easy to jump to that as her diagnosis After a careful history and examination, it became clear that there was another underlying diagnosis Chest Xray, echocardiogram and CT scan revealed marked right ventricular dilatation and pulmonary hypertension, alongside a persistent left superior vena cava PLSVC Further investigation with cardiac MRI and coronary angiography at a tertiary centre demonstrated that she not only have a PLSVC but also a partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage and sinus venosus atrial septal defect This case highlights the importance of considering all differentials and approaching investigations in a logical manner,A 58‐day‐old female infant reported with complaints of fever, difficult breathing, loose stool, vomiting and refusal to feed for 4 days Laboratory work showed anaemia, leucocytosis with elevated neutrophils and thrombocytopenia along with high C‐reactive protein and D‐dimer with bilateral patchy infiltrate on X‐ray and positivity for COVID‐19 Her blood culture was also positive for Gram‐negative bacilli acinetobacter lwoffii Along with antibiotics, she was given 50 ml convalescent plasma She was off oxygen within 2 days and showed improvement in lung lesions, and RT‐PCR was negative by day 7 and discharged by day 10 of transfusion,ABSTRACT We aimed to investigate the prevalence of pulmonary thromboembolism PTE and its association with clinical variables in a cohort of hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 patients receiving lowmolecularweight heparin LMWH at prophylactic dosageIn this retrospective observational study we included COVID19 patients receiving prophylactic LMWH from admission but still referred for lowerlimbs venous Doppler ultrasound LLUS and computed tomography pulmonary angiography CTPA for clinical PTE suspicion A dedicated radiologist reviewed CTPA images to assess PTE presenceextensionFrom March 1 to April 30, 2020, 45 patients were included 34 men, median age 67 years, interquartile range IQR 6076 Twentyseven 60 had PTE signs at CTPA, 1727 63 with bilateral involvement, none with main branch PTE In 3345 patients 73 patients LLUS was performed before CTPA, with 3 patients having superficial vein thrombosis 9, none with CTPAconfirmed PTE and 1 patient having deep vein thrombosis 3, with CTPAconfirmed PTE Thirtythree patients 73 had at least one comorbidity, mainly hypertension 2345, 51 and cardiovascular disease 1545, 33 Before CTPA, 5 patients had high Ddimer 1121u200aμgmL, IQR 9101302, 19 high fibrinogen 550u200amgdL, IQR 476590, 26 high interleukin6 79u200apgmL, IQR 31282, and 11 high Creactive protein 960u200amgdL, IQR 6751065, Creactive protein being the only laboratory parameter significantly differing between patients with and without PTE Pu200au200a002High PTE incidence 60 in COVID19 hospitalized patients under prophylactic LMWH could substantiate further tailoring of anticoagulation therapy,In COVID‐19 patients receiving enoxaparin and antiplatelets therapy, aggregometry and thromboelastography might be considered an adjunctive tool to identify the time to perform procedures at risk of bleeding, such as tracheostomy In COVID‐19 patients receiving enoxaparin and antiplatelets therapy, aggregometry and thromboelastography might be considered an adjunctive tool to identify the time to perform procedures at risk of bleeding, such as tracheostomy,In their lettertotheeditor entitled Misconceptions of pathophysiology of happy hypoxemia and implications for management of COVID19, Tobin et al Respir Res 21249, 2020 debated our views on happy hypoxemia in COVID19 Respir Res 21198, 2020 We thank the authors for their interesting comments and alternative viewpoints, and we would like to clarify several important aspects raised,Abstract  Rationale Triage is crucial for patients management and estimation of the required Intensive Care Unit ICU beds is fundamental for Health Systems during the COVID19 pandemic   Objective To assess whether chest Computed Tomography CT of COVID19 pneumonia has an incremental role in predicting patients admission to ICU   Methods We performed volumetric and texture analysis of the areas of the affected lung in CT of 115 outpatients with COVID19 infection presenting to the Emergency Room with dyspnea and unresponsive hypoxyemia Admission blood laboratory including lymphocyte count, serum lactate dehydrogenase, Ddimer and CReactive Protein and the ratio between the arterial partial pressure of oxygen and inspired oxygen were collected By calculating the areas under the receiveroperating characteristic curves AUC, we compared the performance of blood laboratoryarterial gas analyses features alone and combined with the CT features in two hybrid models Hybrid radiological and Hybrid radiomicsfor predicting ICU admission Following a machine learning approach, 63 patients were allocated to the training and 52 to the validation set   Measurements and Main Results  Twentynine 25 of patients were admitted to ICU The Hybrid radiological model comprising the lung consolidation performed significantly p004 better in predicting ICU admission in the validation AUC082 95Confidence Interval 068095 set than the blood laboratoryarterial gas analyses features alone AUC071 95Confidence Interval 056086 A risk calculator for ICU admission was derived and is available at httpsgithubcomcgplabcovidapp    Conclusions The volume of the consolidated lung in CT of patients with COVID19 pneumonia has a mild but significant incremental value in predicting ICU admission,We are focusing on three things for every patient in the hospital with COVID19, namely dexamethasone, remdesivir and enhanced anticoagulation protocols as this had shown improved mortality However, the bleedingxa0risk in these patients has not been taken into consideration In our ICU setting at Rochester General hospital, we have seen too many cases with gastrointestinal bleeding andxa0hemoptysis in COVID19 patients In this case, we report bleeding related to central access removal related to coagulation inhibitors that lead to airway compression The aim of this case is to keep bleeding tendency of COVID19 patients on the radar and to delineate that it has clear severe consequences just as clotting,BackgroundThis study aimed to analyze the rates of tracheobronchitis signs observed on the ventilation scans of COVID19 patients with shortness of breath, with comparisons to a nonCOVID populationMethodsLung scintigraphy was collected in 10 such COVID patients, as well as from a nonCOVID population investigated outside the epidemic wave period, on a CZTSPECTCT system, with ventilation images recorded with 99mTclabeled Technegas and perfusion images with 99mTclabeled albumin macroaggregatesResultsA diffuse tracheobronchial uptake was observed on the ventilation scans from 3 COVID patients 30, whereas this rate was 3 390 in the nonCOVID group Pu2009u20090013 These 3 patients had no laryngeal extension of Technegas uptake and limited parenchymal lung abnormalities Followup scintigraphy demonstrated the withdrawal of tracheobronchitis signs in two cases, and the advent of a severe pulmonary embolism in oneConclusionSigns of tracheobronchitis may constitute the principal finding on lung SPECTCT images of COVID19 patients with shortness of breath,,,This corrects the article DOI 101016jrecesp202004002,Evidence supports the link between air pollution and coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 Therefore, exposure to indoor pollution IDP is likely to be associated with the disease The poor, refugees, and migrant workers who live in feeble conditions are the most vulnerable The pandemic has caused many people to remain indoors, especially atrisk individuals eg, the elderly, diabetics, obese, cardiac, and chronic lung disease patients Home isolation may be an underlying factor to other health problems among these populations if the place where they are socially isolating is not adequately ventilated Therefore, understanding the consequences of the relationship between IDP and the COVID19 pandemic is essential,Background Due to the increasing prevalence of covid19, the World Health Organization declared on 30 January 2020, the spread of the new coronavirus as a 6th public health emergency of international concern Objectives To assess the extent of the disease in the pediatric population in our region, we conducted a clinical pediatric screening for Covid19 and evaluated factors that affected its manifestation in children Methods In this study, 474761 children under 19 years of age were screened in two phases In the first phase, 680 cases were considered as suspect and referred to the health centers, where the second phase of screening took place Finally, 230 probable cases were referred to specialized centers for further investigation Results Almost all of the cases had pneumonia and symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and fever over 38°C 567 Other clinical symptoms included hypotension 174, Hemoptysis 161, sore throat 116 and difficult breathing 67 26 of patients had a history of chronic disease mainly pulmonary and cardiac There was a statistically significant relationship between the probable causes and the symptoms of the disease P  005, between age and probable cases P  005, and between death and underlying disease P  005 However, of all the cases, only 15 65 had a positive PCR test, 39 patients were hospitalized 17, 173 cases 75 received outpatient treatment and 18 cases 78 died Conclusions Children with shortness of breath, cough, pneumonia, fever over 38 and underlying disease are suspicious for Covid19 and should be hospitalized to be evaluated with laboratory tests,,,COVID19 public health policy has focused on the SARSCoV2 virus and its effects on human health while environmental factors have been largely ignored In considering the epidemiological triad agenthostenvironment applicable to all disease, we investigated a possible environmental factor in the COVID19 pandemic ambient radiofrequency radiation from wireless communication systems including microwaves and millimeter waves COVID19 surfaced in Wuhan, China shortly after the implementation of citywide 5G fifth generation of wireless radiation, and spread globally, demonstrating a statistical correlation to international communities with 5G antennas installed In this study, we examined the peerreviewed scientific literature on the detrimental bioeffects of radiofrequency radiation RFR and identified several ways in which RFR may be contributing to COVID19 as a toxic environmental cofactor We conclude that RFR and, in particular, 5G, which involves 4G infrastructure densification, has exacerbated COVID19 prevalence and severity by weakening host immunity and increasing SARSCoV2 virulence by 1 causing morphologic changes in erythrocytes including echinocyte and rouleaux formation that may be contributing to hypercoagulation 2 impairing microcirculation and reducing erythrocyte and hemoglobin levels exacerbating hypoxia 3 amplifying immune system dysfunction, including immunosuppression, autoimmunity, and hyperinflammation 4 increasing cellular oxidative stress and the production of free radicals exacerbating vascular injury and organ damage 5 augmenting intracellular Ca2 essential for viral entry, replication, and release, in addition to promoting proinflammatory pathways and 6 worsening heart arrhythmias and cardiac disorders In short, RFR is a ubiquitous environmental stressor that contributes to adverse health outcomes of COVID19 We invoke the Precautionary Principle and strongly recommend a moratorium on 5G wireless infrastructure at this crucial time to help mitigate the pandemic, and to preserve public health until governmental safety standards for RFR exposure based on current and future research are defined and employed,,Pulse oximetry is routinely used to noninvasively monitor oxygen saturation levels A low oxygen level in the blood means low oxygen in the tissues, which can ultimately lead to organ failure Yet, contrary to heart rate variability measures, a field which has seen the development of stable standards and advanced toolboxes and software, no such standards and open tools exist for continuous oxygen saturation time series variability analysis The primary objective of this research was to identify, implement and validate key digital oximetry biomarkers OBMs for the purpose of creating a standard and associated reference toolbox for continuous oximetry time series analysis We review the sleep medicine literature to identify clinically relevant OBMs We implement these biomarkers and demonstrate their clinical value within the context of obstructive sleep apnea OSA diagnosis on a total of nu2009u20093806 individual polysomnography recordings totaling 26,686u2009h of continuous data A total of 44 digital oximetry biomarkers were implemented Reference ranges for each biomarker are provided for individuals with mild, moderate, and severe OSA and for nonOSA

using pbom may provide information on the underlying physiological control systems and enhance our understanding of the manifestations and etiology of diseases, with emphasis on respiratory diseases,BACKGROUND As the use of left atrial appendage closure LAAC becomes more widespread, improvements in resource utilization and costeffectiveness are necessary Currently, there are limited data on sameday discharge SDD after LAAC We aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of SDD versus nonSDD in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who underwent LAAC METHODS We retrospectively studied 211 patients who underwent the WATCHMAN procedure in a tertiary hospital June 2016 to June 2019 The primary safety outcome was the composite of stroke, systemic embolism, major bleeding requiring transfusion, vascular complications requiring endovascular intervention, or death through 7 days periprocedural and 45 days postprocedure The secondary outcomes were the individual components of the primary outcome and allcause readmission We compared the clinical outcomes of patients who had SDD and nonSDD postprocedure RESULTS Patients with procedurerelated complications on the day of LAAC and patients who were admitted for acute clinical events before LAAC were excluded One hundred ninety patients were included in the final analysis Seventytwo of 190 38 patients had SDD, and 118 of 190 62 had nonSDD There were no statistically significant differences in the primary safety outcome through 7 days 14 versus 59 P026 and 45 days postprocedure 28 versus 93 P014 between the two groups The secondary outcomes were similar in both groups No patients had devicerelated thrombus on transesophageal echocardiography at 45 days Only 1 patient from the nonSDD group had clinically significant peridevice flow 5 mm at 45 days CONCLUSIONS In a selected cohort of patients who underwent successful elective LAAC with WATCHMAN without sameday procedurerelated complications, the primary safety outcome and secondary outcomes through 7 and 45 days postprocedure were similar in the SDD and nonSDD groups Our findings are hypothesis generating and warrant further investigation in prospective trials,Abstract  Importance Although several biomarkers have shown correlation to prognosis in COVID19 patients, their clinical value is limited because of lack of specificity, suboptimal sensibility, or poor dynamic behavior   Objective In search of better prognostic markers in COVID19, we hypothesized that circulating soluble ST2 sST2 could be associated to a worse outcome, prompted by our previous knowledge of sST2 involvement in heart failureassociated lung deterioration, and by mounting evidence favoring a role of IL33ST2 axis in the disease   Design, Setting and participants One hundred and fiftytwo patients admitted for confirmed COVID19 infection were included in a prospective noninterventional, observational study carried out in a tertiary teaching center Blood samples were drawn at admission, 4872 hours later and at discharge sST2 concentrations, and routine blood laboratory were analyzed   Main outcomes Primary endpoints were admission at intensive care unit ICU and, mortality Other outcomes were a need for high oxygen flow therapy HOF or increasing treatment at 4872 hours   Results Median age was 575 years SD 128, 604 males Ten per cent of patients n15 were derived to ICU andor died during admission The rest stayed hospitalized 8IQR6 days on average About 34 n47, 38 n53 and 485 n66 needed HOF, uptitrate therapy or both, respectively Median IQR sST2 serum concentration ngmL rose to 531309 at admission, peaked at 4872h 79564 and returned to admission levels at discharge 449367, remaining significantly elevated above healthy donor values 186151 A concentration of sST2 above 589 ngmL identified patients progressing to ICU admission or death These results remained significant after multivariable analysis The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve AUC of sST2 for the occurrence of endpoints was 0776 p0001 Admission sST2 was higher in patients who needed uptritate therapy   Conclusions and relevance In patients admitted for COVID19 infection, measurement of sST2 measurement early within 24h after at admission was able to identify patients at risk of severe complications or death,BackgroundBedside measurement of lung volume may provide guidance in the personalised setting of respiratory support, especially in patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome at risk of ventilatorinduced lung injury We propose here a novel operatorindependent technique, enabled by a fibre optic oxygen sensor, to quantify the lung volume available for gas exchange We hypothesised that the continuous measurement of arterial partial pressure of oxygen PaO2 decline during a breathholding manoeuvre could be used to estimate lung volume in a singlecompartment physiological model of the respiratory systemMethodsThirteen pigs with a saline lavage lung injury model and six control pigs were studied under general anaesthesia during mechanical ventilation Lung volumes were measured by simultaneous PaO2 rate of decline VPaO2 and wholelung computed tomography scan VCT during apnoea at different positive endexpiratory and endinspiratory pressuresResultsA total of 146 volume measurements was completed range 134 to 1869xa0mL A linear correlation between VCT and VPaO2 was found both in control slopeu2009u200909, R2u2009u2009088 and in salinelavaged pigs slopeu2009u2009064, R2u2009u2009070 The bias from BlandAltman analysis for the agreement between the VCT and VPaO2 was u200984xa0mL limits of agreementu2009u2009301xa0mL in control andu2009u20092xa0mL LoAu2009u2009406xa0mL in salinelavaged pigs The concordance for changes in lung volume, quantified with polar plot analysis, was u20094º LoAu2009u200919° in control and u20099° LoAu2009u200933° in salinelavaged pigsConclusionBedside measurement of PaO2 rate of decline during apnoea is a potential approach for estimation of lung volume changes associated with different levels of airway pressure,Caffeoylquinic acids, coumarins and dicaffeoyl derivatives are considered to be three kinds of the most abundant bioactive components in Sarcandra glabra, an antiinflammatory herb mainly found in Southern Asia The combined antiinflammatory effect of three typical constituents C  R  I chlorogenic acid  rosmarinic acid  isofraxidin from this plant has been investigated The result implies that targeting the MAPKNFκB pathway would be one of the major mechanisms involved, using LPS stimulated RAW 2647 cells as in vitro model and LPSinduced acute lung injury in mice as in vivo model C  R  I can significantly suppress the levels of nitric oxide NO, proinflammatory cytokines, and inhibit iNOS and COX2 expression in LPStreated RAW2647 macrophage cells Western blot analysis showed that C  R  I suppressed phosphorylation of NFκB and MAPK, including phosphorylation of p65NFκB, IKB, ERK, JNK and P38 Besides, C  R  I suppressed MPO protein expression, but promoted SOD and HO1 expression, and the related targets for C, R, and I were also predicted by molecular docking This indicated that C  R  I could alleviate oxidative stress induced by LPS, which were further verified in the in vivo model of mice with acute lung injury through the measurement of corresponding inflammatory mediators and the analysis of immunehistochemistry,The management of emergency cardiovascular events and especially cardiac arrest, which is occurring more and more often globally, requires the establishment of special interdisciplinary teams blue code, RRT, both to prevent its occurrence and to increase survival rates Special communication and organization tools of these groups SBAR, RSVP have been established worldwide and attention has been given to the development of nontechnical skills of their members ANTS The aim of this review was to examine the current literature on the function and effectiveness of interdisciplinary teams in the treatment of inhospital cardiovascular emergencies during the Covid19 pandemic Studies from USA, Sweden, Brazil and S Korea showed a reduction of mortality and numbers of inhospital cardiac arrests after RRT teams implementation and interventions Covid19 pandemic is resulting in delaying in CPR implementation to emergency incidents as these teams are required to use special both personal and general protective equipment while managing these incidents Despite differentiations among countries and health systems globally, its comprehensible that interdisciplinary teams have to be reinforced by the setup and implementation of programs and training courses both to improve survival and save heath recourses Keywords Emergency cardiac diseases, Cardiac arrest, Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, Interdisciplinary teams, Pandemic, Coronaviruscovid19,,,WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE Direct oral anticoagulants DOACs are increasingly prescribed instead of warfarin for chronic anticoagulation for ease of dosing, fewer interactions, and less stringent monitoring However, it is important to consider indications and comorbidities for which warfarin is still the preferred anticoagulant This review aims to capture these clinical scenarios in which warfarin may still be preferred over DOACs METHODS We undertook a comprehensive literature search using the PubMed database Key search terms were based on DOAC clinical trial exclusion criteria, as well as indications and conditions in which the use of DOACs for anticoagulation has suggested harm Society guidelines and tertiary literature were used to inform expert opinion where necessary Studies were included if they investigated the use of DOACs or warfarin in the identified indications or conditions RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Currently, evidence for the use of warfarin over DOACs for anticoagulation is strongest for patients with prosthetic valves, antiphospholipid syndrome, or a high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding For several clinical situations, including mitral stenosis, obesity, altered gastrointestinal anatomy, pulmonary arterial hypertension, renal or hepatic impairment, and left ventricular thrombus, evidence is lacking but may eventually support the use of DOACs Depending on indication and condition, appropriateness of DOAC use may vary by agent WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION New evidence continues to support new indications and conditions in which DOACs may be appropriate to use for anticoagulation There are key clinical scenarios, however, in which emerging literature continues to support warfarin as the preferred anticoagulant,Background Recent studies have shown that patients diagnosed with coronarivus disease 2019 COVID19 and also with previous cardiovascular diseases have a higher mortality due to worsening heart disease At the same time, patients without previous cardiovascular disease may also have cardiac complications The aim of this multicenter study was to assess high sensitivity cardiac troponin T hscTnT in patients with COVID19 and to evaluate the incidence of myocardial injury Methods In this multicenter study we enrolled 543 patients, 578 males, median age 63xa0years range 1899 from three selected hospitals University Hospital Tor Vergata in Rome, Fondazione IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, in Milan, S Chiara Hospital in Trento We measured hscTnT in all patients to assess myocardial injury and correlations with patients age, symptoms and disease course Results The data showed that, among the 543 patients studied, 257 patients 473 had hscTnT values higher than the upper reference limit URL of 14xa0ngL Patients with high hscTnT had more frequently fever p,AIMS Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is a still growing pandemic, causing many deaths and socioeconomic damage Elevated expression of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 entry receptor angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 on cardiac cells of patients with heart diseases may be related to cardiovascular burden We have thus analysed cardiovascular and inflammatory microRNAs miRs, sensitive markers of cardiovascular damage, in critically ill, ventilated patients with COVID19 or influenzaassociated acute respiratory distress syndrome InfluenzaARDS admitted to the intensive care unit and healthy controls METHODS AND RESULTS Circulating miRs miR21, miR126, miR155, miR208a, and miR499 were analysed in a discovery cohort consisting of patients with mechanicallyventilated COVID19 nxa0xa018 and healthy controls nxa0xa015 A validation study was performed in an independent cohort of mechanicallyventilated COVID19 patients nxa0xa020, InfluenzaARDS patients nxa0xa013 and healthy controls nxa0xa032 In both cohorts, RNA was isolated from serum and cardiovascular diseaseinflammatoryrelevant miR concentrations were measured by miRspecific TaqMan PCR analyses In both the discovery and the validation cohort, serum concentration of miR21, miR155, miR208a and miR499 were significantly increased in COVID19 patients compared to healthy controls Calculating the area under the curve using receiver operating characteristic analysis miR155, miR208a and miR499 showed a clear distinction between COVID19 and InfluenzaARDS patients CONCLUSION In this exploratory study, inflammation and cardiac myocytespecific miRs were upregulated in critically ill COVID19 patients Importantly, miR profiles were able to differentiate between severely ill, mechanicallyventilated InfluenzaARDS and COVID19 patients, indicating a rather specific response and cardiac involvement of COVID19,ObjectiveWe aimed to characterize the effects of prone positioning on respiratory mechanics and oxygenation in invasively ventilated patients with SARSCoV2 ARDSResultsThis was a prospective cohort study in the Intensive Care Unit ICU of a tertiary referral centre We included 20 consecutive, invasively ventilated patients with laboratory confirmedxa0SARSCoV2 related ARDS who underwent prone positioning in ICU as part of their management The main outcome was the effect of prone positioning on gas exchange and respiratory mechanics There was a median improvement in the PaO2FiO2 ratio of 132 in the prone position compared to the supine position IQR 67228 We observed lower PaO2FiO2 ratios in those with low u2009median static compliance P,BACKGROUND Steroidresistant asthma is often characterized by high levels of neutrophils and mixed TH2TH17 immune profiles Indeed, neutrophils are key drivers of chronic lung inflammation in multiple respiratory diseases Their numbers correlate strongly with disease severity, and their presence is often associated with exacerbation of chronic lung inflammation OBJECTIVE What factors drive development of neutrophilmediated chronic lung disease remains largely unknown, and we sought to study the role of GMCSF as a potential regulator in chronic asthma METHODS Different experimental animal models of chronic asthma were used in combination with alveolar macrophagereconstitution of global GMCSF receptor knockout mice as well as celltypespecific knockout animals to elucidate the role of GMCSF signaling in chronic airway inflammation RESULTS We identify GMCSF signaling as a critical factor regulating pulmonary accumulation of neutrophils We show that although being not required for intrinsically regulating neutrophil migration, GMCSF controls lung dendritic cell function, which in turn promotes Tcelldependent recruitment of neutrophils to the airways We demonstrate that GMCSF regulates lung dendritic cell antigen uptake, transport, and TH2TH17 cell priming in an intrinsic fashion, which in turn drives pulmonary granulocyte recruitment and contributes to development of airway hyperresponsiveness in chronic disease CONCLUSIONS We identify GMCSF as a potentially novel therapeutic target in chronic lung inflammation, describing a GMCSFdependent lung conventional dendritic cellTcellneutrophil axis that drives chronic lung disease,,The high risk of heart failure in aging adults with congenital heart diseases is based on anatomical, hemodynamic and myocardial residual conditions and sequelae of the congenital disease however, acquired diseases with their additive heart failure risk become important with increasing age In view of the relatively young age of the patients, preventive treatment strategies are becoming increasingly important In contrast to drug treatment of heart failure in acquired cardiac diseases, only few and insufficiently powered randomized studies are available, which, with one exception, have so far delivered no evidence of improvement in the prognosis by drug treatment strategies The recommendations for drug treatment strategies are currently based on the guidelines for the treatment of heart failure of acquired cardiac diseases The anatomical and hemodynamic heterogeneity of congenital heart diseases represent a special challenge,See article on page 2934, in this issue,,Highlights    • ACC Scientific Sessions 2020 shared the latest research in cardiology   • We highlight results from 14 latebreaking trials   • Areas covered include TAVR, coronary, and peripheral artery disease,Background Data from the 2009 influenza pandemic suggested asthma might protect from severe disease in hospitalized patients Asthma does not appear to increase risk for hospitalization or mortality with COVID19 Objective This study was undertaken to see if atopy actually protected those hospitalized with COVID19 Methods Retrospective chart review on all patients testing positive for SARSCoV2 over 2xa0monthsxa0at a major adult and pediatric tertiary referral center hospital Charts were evaluated for history of atopic disease, as were the need for ICU admission, requirement for supplemental oxygen andor intubation, and in hospital mortality Results No significant differences in outcomes for patients nxa0xa0275 based on atopic disease were noted ICU admission, 43 versus 447 atopic versus no atopic disease, respectively pxa0xa0084 supplemental oxygen use, 791 versus 736 pxa0xa0036 intubation rate, 358 versus 365 pxa0xa0092 and mortality rate, 134 versus 207 pxa0xa0019 More patients with atopic disease had COPD listed as a diagnosis in their chart 388 versus 173, pxa0xa002 Conclusion Severity of COVID19 in hospitalized patients does not differ based on atopic status However, adjusting for presence of COPD led to a suggestion of possible reduced severity in patients with atopy but not asthma,,,,INTRODUCTION The new coronavirus pandemic has led to scarcity of invasive ventilation resources in hospitals in several countries In this context, the Portuguese Medical Association invited intensive care physicians who, in collaboration with SYSADVANCE SA, developed SYSVENT OM1, a ventilator capable of operating in controlled and assisted modes volume and pressure and able to treat patients admitted to intensive care units In this study we do the proof of concept comparing programmed tidal volume, inspiratory pressure and positive endexpiratory pressure with those measured by the ventilator and an external measuring equipment MATERIAL AND METHODS We set up the ventilator in tandem with an artificial lung and a flow analyzer We measured expiratory tidal volume, and inspiratory pressure against three levels of compliance, each with six steps of tidal volume Positive endexpiratory pressure was measured at 2 cmH2O incremental along eight steps For each measurement, we performed three readings RESULTS Considering each of the three single variables, the mean value of the highest difference between programmed values and measured values is, for all of them, within what we considered to be acceptable for a prototype model tidal volume  281 mL, inspiratory pressure  08 cmH2O and positive endexpiratory pressure  11 cmH2O This difference is greater when evaluated with the external measuring equipment in comparison with the ventilator DISCUSSION The results showed a good monitoring and accuracy performance Technical limitations related with the artificial lung and the flow analyzer have been documented, which do not compromise the results, but limit their amplitude CONCLUSION For tested parameters, the ventilator has a good operating performance, is in accordance with the initial premises and has potential for clinical use,,,Hopelessness is associated with decreased physical activity PA and increased adverse events and death in patients with ischemic heart disease IHD Rates of PA in patients with IHD continue to be low in both hospitalbased cardiac rehabilitation and home settings While researchers have investigated strategies to increase PA among patients with IHD, interventions to promote PA specifically in IHD patients who report hopelessness are lacking We describe the protocol for a NIHfunded randomized controlled trial designed to establish the effectiveness of a 6week intervention Heart Up to promote increased PA in IHD patients who report hopelessness Participants nu2009u2009225 are randomized to one of three groups 1 motivational social support MSS from a nurse, 2 MSS from a nurse plus significant other support SOS, or 3 attention control Aims are to 1 test the effectiveness of 6 weeks of MSS and MSS with SOS on increasing mean minutes per day of moderate to vigorous PA 2 determine the effects of change in moderate to vigorous PA on hopelessness and 3 determine if perceived social support and motivation exercise selfregulation mediate the effects of the intervention on PA A total of 69 participants have been enrolled to date The protocol has been consistently and accurately used by research personnel We address the protocol challenges presented by the COVID19 pandemic and steps taken to maintain fidelity to the intervention Findings from this study could transform care for IHD patients who report hopelessness by promoting selfmanagement of important PA goals that can contribute to better health outcomes,,,Coronavirus disease COVID19, caused by a highly contagious novel coronavirus, has seen a rapid surge of cases over the past 6 months spreading to more than 215 countries and posing a global threat to mankind Reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction RTPCR from pharyngeal swabs is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of this disease Portable chest radiography CXR, point of care ultrasound, and computed tomography CT are crucial modalities in diagnosis and followup Portable CXR can help in patients who are clinically unstable, and also to prevent the cumbersome process of steriliastion after every CT scan However, chest CT is useful as a problemsolving tool, to look for progression and complications associated with the disease In a few cases, in our experience as has also been documented by others, RTPCR was negative in early disease, and CT chest was able to detect the radiological findings raising suspicion of COVID19 With this pictorial review, we aim to describe and illustrate the typical, and a few atypical, radiological findings of this disease,BACKGROUND The utility of longterm intermittent heart rhythm monitoring after atrial fibrillation AF ablation remains unclear Therefore, we compared the efficacy and usability of longterm intermittent AliveCor Kardia ACK versus short continuous Holter heart rhythm monitoring for the detection of AF recurrences after AF ablation and evaluated ACK accuracy to detect AF METHODS Patients were provided with Holter for 24xa0h simultaneously with an ACK 4 weeks used three times a day and in case of symptoms The primary endpoint was the difference in proportion of patients diagnosed with recurrent AF by ACK as compared to Holter monitoring Secondary endpoints were the usability System Usability Scale and a fouritem questionnaire of ACK and Holter monitoring and the accuracy of the ACK algorithm for AF detection RESULTS Out of 126 postablation patients, 115 913 35 females, median age 640 580680 years transmitted overall 7838 ACK ECG recordings ACK and Holter monitoring detected 29 252 and 17 148 patients with AF recurrences, respectively p,,,Summary  Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARSCoV2 infection in golden Syrian hamster GSH causes lung pathology and resembles human coronavirus disease Covid19 However, extrapulmonary pathologies of SARSCoV2 infection that result in long Covid remains undefined in GSH Here, using in silico modelling we show that hamster angiotensinconverting enzyme2 ACE2 and neuropilin1 NRP1 interaction with SARSCoV2 is similar to human Intranasal SARSCoV2 infection in GSH resulted in early onset of lung pathologies marked by aggressive inflammatory response Remarkably, late phase of SARSCoV2 infection in GSH showed cardiovascular complications CVC characterized by ventricular hypertrophy, ventricular wall thickening, interstitial coronary fibrosis and altered lipidomics with elevated cholesterol, lowdensity lipoprotein and long chain fatty acid triglycerides Moreover, serum metabolomics profile of infected GSH correlated with Covid19 patients Together, we propose GSH as a suitable animal model to study immediate and long Covid19 pathologies that could be extended to therapeutics against Covid19 related CVC,The expression rate of SARSCoV2 entry genes, angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2, the main viral receptor and the proteases, furin and transmembrane serine protease 2 TMPRSS2 in cystic fibrosis CF individuals is poorly known Hence, we examined their levels in upper respiratory samples of CF patients n  46 and healthy controls n  45 Moreover, we sought to understand the interplay of type I interferon IFNI with ACE2, furin and TMPRSS2 by evaluating their gene expression with respect to ISG15, a wellknown marker of IFN activation, in upper respiratory samples and after ex vivo IFNβ exposure Lower ACE2 levels and trends toward the reduction of furin and TMPRSS2 were found in CF patients compared with the healthy controls decreased ACE2 amounts were also detected in CF individuals with pancreatic insufficiency and in those receiving inhaled antibiotics Moreover, there was a strong positive correlation between ISG15 and ACE2 levels However, after ex vivo IFNβ stimulation of nasopharyngeal cells, the truncated isoform dACE2, recently demonstrated as the IFN stimulated one with respect to the fulllength isoform flACE2, slightly augmented in cells from CF patients whereas in those from healthy donors, dACE2 levels showed variable levels of upregulation An altered expression of SARSCOV2 entry genes and a poor responsiveness of dACE2 to IFNI stimulation might be crucial in the diffusion of SARSCoV2 infection in CF,BackgroundCoronary artery abnormalities in Kawasaki disease KD are assessed using echocardiographic zscores We hypothesized that changing the coronary artery CA zscore model would alter diagnosis and management of children with KDMethodsIn this retrospective singlecenter study of children treated for KD 9200712020, we collected echocardiographic measurements for the left anterior descending LAD, right RCA, and left main LMCA coronary arteries during 3 illness phases and calculated Boston and Pediatric Heart Network PHN zscores Agreement between Boston and PHN zscores was assessed using Kappa κ and Lins Concordance Correlation Coefficients CCC and BlandAltman analysisResultsFor 904 echocardiograms from 357 children, the median Boston LAD zscore was lower than the PHN 03 IQRu2009u200906, 15 vs 16 IQR 07, 28, CCC 094 95 CI 093, 095, moderate agreement, aggregated across all illness phases RCA and LMCA zscores showed substantial agreement With conversion from Boston to PHN models, the percentage of individual LAD zscoresu2009u200925 increased 146 to 321 At least one CA zscore classification changed in 213 children 597 across all phases, and 48 children 134 had a change that altered recommended antithrombotic strategy Agreement between models differed by age, sex, and raceConclusionsConversion from Boston to PHN zscores changed at least 1 CA zscore classification in over half of KD patients and changed recommended antithrombotic management in 13, largely driven by LAD measurements Since diagnosis and management of KD and KDlike diseases rely upon CA zscores, the clinical and research implications of these findings merit further exploration,,Background Since the first documented outbreak of a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome inducing Coronavirus in China at the end of 2019 the virus has spread to all continents, leading the WHO to declare a pandemic in March 2020 While this virus primarily targets the alveoli in the lungs, multiple authors have described an increased rate of thromboembolic events in affected patients We present this case of a myocardial infarction with no obstructive coronary atherosclerosis in an otherwise healthy 48yearold patient Case summary A 48yearold female, presenting with chest pain radiating to her left shoulder with no cardiovascular risk factors other than genetic predisposition, was screened for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 and tested positive Although computed tomography angiography excluded obstructive coronary heart disease, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed an acute myocardial infarction with no obstructive coronary arteries of the inferior wall The patient was treated with dual antiplatelet therapy, an angiotensinconvertingenzyme inhibitor and a statin, and assigned to a cardiac rehabilitation program Conclusion We report a serious thromboembolic event during an oligosymptomatic SARSCoV2 infection in a healthy, young patient While these two diseases may have occurred simultaneously, by chance, it is possible that the prothrombotic effects of the SARSCoV2 infection facilitated the infarction This case further demonstrates the significant cardiovascular morbidity potentially caused by SARSCoV2,COVID19 patients typically present with lower airway disease, although involvement of other organ systems is usually the rule Hematological manifestations such as thrombocytopenia and reduced lymphocyte and eosinophil numbers are highly prevalent in COVID19 and have prognostic significance Few data, however, are available about the prevalence and significance of anemia in COVID19 In an observational study, we investigated the prevalence, pathogenesis and clinical significance of anemia among 206 patients with COVID19 at the time of their hospitalization in an Internal Medicine unit The prevalence of anemia was 61 in COVID19, compared with 45 in a control group of 71 patients with clinical and laboratory findings suggestive of COVID19, but nasopharyngeal swab tests negative for SARSCoV2 RNA pu2009u20090022 Mortality was higher in SARSCoV2 positive patients In COVID19, females had lower hemoglobin concentration than males and a higher prevalence of moderatesevere anemia 25 versus 13, pu2009u20090032 In most cases, anemia was mild and due to inflammation, sometimes associated with iron andor vitamin deficiencies Determinants of hemoglobin concentration included erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum cholinesterase, ferritin and protein concentrations and number of chronic diseases affecting each patient Hemoglobin concentration was not related to overall survival that was, on the contrary, influenced by red blood cell distribution width, age, lactate dehydrogenase and the ratio of arterial partial oxygen pressure to inspired oxygen fraction In conclusion, our results highlight anemia as a common manifestation in COVID19 Although anemia does not directly influence mortality, it usually affects elderly, frail patients and can negatively influence their quality of life,Exhaled breath analysis has the potential to provide valuable insight on the status of various metabolic pathways taking place in the lungs locally and other vital organs, via systemic circulation For years, volatile organic compounds VOCs have been proposed as feasible alternative diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for different respiratory pathologiesWe reviewed the currently published literature on the discovery of exhaled breath VOCs and their utilisation in various respiratory diseasesKey barriers in the development of clinical breath tests include the lack of unified consensus for breath collection and analysis and the complexity of understanding the relationship between the exhaled VOCs and the underlying metabolic pathways We present a comprehensive overview, in light of published literature and our experience from coordinating a national breathomics centre, of the progress made to date and some of the key challenges in the field and ways to overcome them We particularly focus on the relevance of breathomics to clinicians and the valuable insights it adds to diagnostics and disease monitoringBreathomics holds great promise and our findings merit further largescale multicentre diagnostic studies using standardised protocols to help position this novel technology at the centre of respiratory disease diagnostics,BACKGROUND Lung ultrasound LU is becoming an increasingly important diagnostic tool in detecting lung involvement in Corona Virus Disease 2019 COVID19 The aim of this study was to ascertain the likelihood of finding LU abnormalities mimicking lung involvement in COVID19 negative healthy individuals METHODS We performed LU on 265 healthcare workers not presenting COVID19 major symptoms and in good health during the course of a serological screening program for COVID19 in our General Hospital LU results were reported as total Lung Ultrasound Score LUS using a 12zone method of reporting RESULTS 250265 subjects were included in the COVID19 negative group LU was not completely normal LUS ≠ 0 in 65250 COVID19 negative subjects 26 and in 1215 80 poorly symptomatic COVID19 positive subjects with a multifocal pattern in 127 vs 667 of cases respectively Age and COVID19 positivity were independent predictors of total LUS A total LUS  2 had a sensitivity of 6667 and a specificity of 8560 in detecting COVID19 positivity CONCLUSIONS A slightly altered LU can be quite frequent in healthy COVID19 negative subjects LU can have a role in confirming but not screening COVID19 poorly symptomatic cases,Interstitial lung diseases ILDs are chronic irreversible pulmonary conditions with significant morbidity and mortality Diagnostic approaches to ILDs are complex and multifactorial Effective therapeutic interventions are continuously investigated and explored with substantial progress, thanks to advances in basic understanding and translational efforts Extracellular vesicles EVs offer a new paradigm in diagnosis and treatment This leads to two significant implications new disease biomarker discovery that enables reliable diagnosis and disease assessment and the development of regenerative medicine therapeutics that target fibroproliferative processes in diseased lung tissue In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the role of diseased tissuederived EVs in the development of interstitial lung diseases, the utility of these EVs as diagnostic and prognostic tools, and the existing therapeutic utility of EVs Furthermore, we review the potential therapeutic application of EVs derived from various cellular sources,,Cardiovascular disease CVD continues to be the number one killer in the aging population Heart failure HF is also an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with congenital heart disease CHD Novel therapeutic approaches that could restore stable heart function are much needed in both paediatric and adult patients Regenerative medicine holds promises to provide definitive solutions for correction of congenital and acquired cardiac defects In this review article, we recap some important aspects of cardiovascular cell therapy First, we report quantifiable data regarding the scientific advancements in the field and how this has been translated into tangible outcomes according clinical studies and related metaanalyses We then comment on emerging trends and technologies, such as the use of secondgeneration cell products, including pericytelike vascular progenitors, and reprogramming of cells by different approaches including modulation of oxidative stress The more affordable and feasible strategy of repurposing clinically available drugs to awaken the intrinsic healing potential of the heart will be discussed in the light of current social, financial, and ethical context Cell therapy remains a work in progress field Uncertainty in the ability of the experts and policy makers to solve urgent medical problems is growing in a world that is significantly influenced by them This is particularly true in the field of regenerative medicine, due to great public expectations, polarization of leadership and funding, and insufficient translational vision Cardiovascular regenerative medicine should be contextualized in a holistic program with defined priorities to allow a complete realization Reshaping the notion of medical expertise is fundamental to fill the current gap in translation,,Despite the expansion of the understanding in asthma pathophysiology and the continual advances in disease management, a small subgroup of patients remains partially controlled or refractory to standard treatments Upon the identification of immunoglobulin E IgE and other inflammatory mediators, investigations and developments of targeted agents have thrived Omalizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the circulating IgE, which in turn impedes and reduces subsequent releases of the proinflammatory mediators In the past decade, omalizumab has been proven to be efficacious and welltolerated in the treatment of moderatetosevere asthma in both trials and reallife studies, most notably in reducing exacerbation rates and corticosteroid use While growing evidence has demonstrated that omalizumab may be potentially beneficial in treating other allergic diseases, its indication remains confined to treating severe allergic asthma and chronic idiopathic urticaria Future efforts may be bestowed on determining the optimal length of omalizumab treatment, seeking biomarkers that could better predict treatment response and as well as extending its indications,,,Background Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ECMO research using large animals requires a significant amount of resources, slowing down the development of new means of ECMO anticoagulation Therefore, this study developed and evaluated a new rat ECMO model using a 3Dprinted mock oxygenatorMethods The circuit consisted of tubing, a 3Dprinted mock oxygenator, and a roller pump The mock oxygenator was designed to simulate the geometry and blood flow patterns of the fiber bundle in fullscale oxygenators but with a low 25 mL priming volume Rats were placed on arteriovenous ECMO at a 19 mLmin flow rate at two different heparin doses n  3 each low 15 IUkgh for eight hours versus high 50 IUkgh for one hour followed by 25 IUkgh for seven hours The experiment continued for eight hours or until the mock oxygenator failed The mock oxygenator was considered to have failed when its blood flow resistance reached three times its baseline resistanceResults During ECMO, rats maintained nearnormal mean arterial pressure and arterial blood gases with minimal hemodilution The mock oxygenator thrombus weight was significantly different p  005 between the low 002  0006 g and high 0003  0001 g heparin delivery groups, and blood flow resistance was also larger in the low anticoagulation groupConclusions This model is a simple, inexpensive system for investigating new anticoagulation agents for ECMO and provides low and high levels of anticoagulation that can serve as control groups for future studies,Most patients with aortic stenosis AS can be treated with either traditional surgical aortic valve replacement or newly emerged transcatheter aortic valve implantation Therefore, the early and appropriate detection of significant AS has become more important for avoiding overlooking patients who require treatment AS is initially detected by the presence of a systolic ejection murmur SEM However, it is timeconsuming and expensive for all subjects presenting with SEM to undergo comprehensive standard echocardiography using highend ultrasound machines since the SEM is audible in a large proportion of elderly patients and is not specific for significant AS Therefore, further physical examination andor focused cardiac ultrasound FoCUS is required to determine whether patients with a SEM should be referred for standard echocardiography One or more abnormal physical findings in addition to a SEM can rule out a certain proportion of normal cases without overlooking severe AS Most of the previous studies suggesting the usefulness of FoCUS in screening for valvular heart disease only used visual impressions in their assessment of AS By contrast, visual AS and calcification scores are good objective parameters in screening for AS with FoCUS Patients with severe AS and patients with a high probability of ASrelated events are rarely overlooked even if comprehensive standard echocardiography is performed only when either or both of the FoCUS scores is 3 or more The appropriate combination of physical examinations and FoCUS to screen for AS is discussed in this review article,Background Several mechanisms allow humans to resist the extreme conditions encountered during breathhold diving Available nitric oxide NO is one of the major contributors to such complex adaptations at depth and oxidative stress is one of the major collateral effects of diving Due to technical difficulties, these biomarkers have not so far been studied in vivo while at depth The aim of this study is to investigate nitrate and nitrite NOx concentration, total antioxidant capacity TAC and lipid peroxidation TBARS before, during, and after repetitive breathhold dives in healthy volunteers Materials and Methods Blood plasma, obtained from 14 expert breathhold divers, was tested for differences in NOx, TAC, and TBARS between predive, bottom, surface, 30 and 60 min postdive samples Results We observed a statistically significant increase of NOx plasma concentration in the bottom blood draw as compared to the predive condition while we did not find any difference in the following samples We found a statistically significant decrease in TAC at the bottom but the value returned to normality immediately after reaching the surface We did not find any statistically significant difference in TBARS Discussion The increased plasma NOx values found at the bottom were not observed at surface and post dive sampling T0, T30, T60, showing a very rapid return to the predive values Also TAC values returned to pre diving levels immediately after the end of hyperbaric exposure, probably as a consequence of the activation of endogenous antioxidant defenses TBARS did not show any difference during the protocol,It remains unclear if intubation and ventilation earlier in the disease course confers a survival advantage in acute respiratory distress syndrome Our objective was to determine whether patients with COVID19 who died following mechanical ventilation were more advanced in their disease compared to survivors Fortyseven patients admitted directly to our centre received ventilation, of who 26 57 patients died The rate of fall in SpO2FiO2 ratio pxa0xa00478 and increasing respiratory rate pxa0xa00948 prior to IMV were similar between survivors and nonsurvivors Our data support a trial of continuous positive airway pressure prior to IMV in patients with moderatetosevere COVID19 ARDS,INTRODUCTION In Tunisia, as elsewhere in the world, severe forms of acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS related to SARSCovid19 have been observed When the usual means of resuscitation were no longer sufficient, the implementation of the Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or ECMO was needed AIM The whole problem of the management of these patients in this pandemic period has been to manage the operation of the ECMO machine, usually reserved for expert and specialized centers in the field METHODS The cardiovascular surgery department of La Rabta teaching hospital of Tunis has tried the experience of management of ECMO implanted in the different reanimations of Tunis, remotely, using telemedicine and social networks Thus, a FacebookMessenger discussion group was created and enabled the management of patients under ECMO via video conferencing in real time involving all stakeholders RESULTS A call was made whenever the physician needed it The video provided an opportunity to discuss with surgeons and perfusionists in real time the complications or problems of these patients Their clinical status was continuously shared on the focus group Following the instructions of the expert surgeons and the exchanges made on the group, the reanimator could then intervene on this or that parameter CONCLUSION Social media have invaded everyones daily lives and health professionals are not exception to this trend The Covid19 pandemic has only strengthened this digital alternative with the goal of efficiency and patient interest While their use in a professional setting offers many advantages, it must nevertheless be done in compliance with the rules of ethics and bring real added value,OBJECTIVES Heart Failure is a chronic syndrome affecting over 57 million in the US and 26 million adults worldwide with nearly 50 experiencing depressive symptoms The objective of the study is to compare the effects of two evidencebased treatment options for adult patients with depression and advanced heart failure, on depressive symptom severity, physical and mental health related quality of life HRQoL, heartfailure specific quality of life, caregiver burden, morbidity, and mortality at 3, 6 and 12months METHODS Trial design Pragmatic, randomized, comparative effectiveness trial Interventions The treatment interventions are 1 Behavioral Activation BA, a patientcentered psychotherapy which emphasizes engagement in enjoyable and valued personalized activities as selected by the patient or 2 Antidepressant Medication Management administered using the collaborative care model MEDS Participants Adults aged 18 and over with advanced heart failure defined as New York Heart Association NYHA Class II, III, and IV and depression defined as a score of 10 or above on the PHQ9 and confirmed by the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview for the DSM5 selected from all patients at CedarsSinai Medical Center who are admitted with heart failure and all patients presenting to the outpatient programs of the Smidt Heart Institute at CedarsSinai Medical Center We plan to randomize 416 patients to BA or MEDS, with an estimated 28 loss to followupinability to collect followup data Thus, we plan to include 150 in each group for a total of 300 participants from which data after randomization will be collected and analyzed CONCLUSIONS The current trial is the first to compare the impact of BA and MEDS on depressive symptoms, quality of life, caregiver burden, morbidity, and mortality in patients with depression and advanced heart failure The trial will provide novel results that will be disseminated and implemented into a wide range of current practice settings REGISTRATION ClinicalTrialsGov Identifier NCT03688100,BACKGROUND Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 commonly present with fever, constitutional symptoms, and respiratory symptoms However, atypical presentations are also well known Though isolated mesenteric arterial occlusion associated with COVID19 has been reported in literature, combined superior mesenteric arterial and venous thrombosis is rare We report a case of combined superior mesenteric arterial and venous occlusion associated with COVID19 infection CASE REPORT We report a case of a 45yearold man who was a health care worker who presented to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain The clinical examination was unremarkable, but imaging revealed acute mesenteric ischemia caused by superior mesenteric artery and superior mesenteric vein occlusion Imaging of the chest was suggestive of COVID19 infection, which was later confirmed with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of his nasopharyngeal swab To date, only 1 case of combined superior mesenteric artery and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis caused by COVID19 has been reported WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS During the COVID19 pandemic it is important to keep mesenteric ischemia in the differential diagnosis of unexplained abdominal pain Routinely adding highresolution computed tomography of the chest to abdominal imaging should be considered in patients with acute abdomen because it can help to identify COVID19 immediately © 2020 Elsevier Inc,ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE TADIOS is an herbal formulation prepared from a mixture of Taraxacum officinale L Weber ex FHWigg, Dioscorea batatas Decaisne and Schizonepeta tenuifolia Benth Briquet These plants have traditionally been used in Asia to treat a variety of respiratory diseases A bulk of literature on traditional Korean medicine describe their activities and functions for respiratory problems Therefore, we hypothesized that the combination of these plants might be effective in alleviating respiratory symptoms AIM OF THE STUDY In this study, we investigated whether TADIOS ameliorates LPSinduced acute lung injury via regulation of the Nrf2HO1 signaling pathway MATERIALS AND METHODS The LPSinduced acute lung injury mouse model was used to determine the antiinflammatory and antioxidative stress effects of TADIOS The amount of marker compounds contained in TADIOS was quantified using highperformance liquid chromatography HPLC analysis The protein level of proinflammatory cytokines in culture supernatant was measured by ELISA Changes in the RNA level of proinflammatory cytokines in mice lungs and RAW2647xa0cells were measured by quantitative RTPCR The relative amounts of reactive oxygen species ROS were measured by DCFDA assay Western blot analysis was used to evaluate expression of cellular proteins Effects of TADIOS on antioxidant responsive elements AREs were determined by luciferase assay The severity of acute lung injury was evaluated by Hematoxylin  Eosin HE staining To test the effects of TADIOS on LPSinduced oxidative stress, myeloperoxidase MPO activity and the total antioxidant capacity were measured RESULTS TADIOS was prepared by extraction of a blend of these three plants by ethanol, and quality control was performed through quantification of marker compounds by HPLC and measurement of bioactivities using cellbased bioassays In the murine macrophage cell line RAW2647, TADIOS effectively suppressed the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL6 and IL1β, and also ROS induced by LPS When RAW2647xa0cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid containing nucleotide sequences for AREs, TADIOS treatment increased the level of relative luciferase units in a dosedependent manner In the LPSinduced acute lung injury mouse model, orally administered TADIOS alleviated lung damage and neutrophil infiltration induced by LPS Consistent with the in vitro data, treatment with TADIOS inhibited the LPSmediated expression of proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress, and activated the Nrf2HO1 axis CONCLUSION Our data suggest the potential for TADIOS to be developed as a safe and effective therapeutics for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome,Women remain largely underrepresented in cardiology worldwide This is especially reflected in scientific sessions where panelists have a male preponderant representation The amount of gender equity in cardiology during scientific activities in the American continent is unknown The objective was to compare gender distribution of invited panelists in cardiology scientific sessions across the Americas during the period 20192020 A retrospective analysis of the cardiology scientific sessions held in North, Central, and South America was conducted Sessions published on the official site and social networks of the national cardiology societies from January 1, 2019 to August 10, 2020 were included Gender distribution and allmale panels were compared according to geographic regions, year, roles in the panel, and the main topics of the session Seven hundred fiftytwo scientific sessions were analyzed, with 3786 participants The median participation of women was 20 IQR 0375 Specifically, the statistics reflected a female participation of 25 IQR 0436 in North America, 125 IQR 043 in Central America and 10 IQR 0333 in South America P  00001 Women participation in the panels was different according to the main topic of the session P  00001, with higher proportions in topics such as cardiovascular diseases in women, congenital heart disease and cardio oncology The frequency of allmale panels was 368 CI95 333401, and it increased over time 2019 309 vs 2020 403 Pu202fu202f0012 There is gender inequity in cardiology scientific sessions held in different regions of the Americas, with low participation of women especially in interventionist panels and leadership roles,Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation ECPR is a salvage procedure in which extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ECMO is initiated emergently on patients who have had cardiac arrest CA and on whom the conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation CCPR has failed Awareness and usage of ECPR are increasing all over the world Significant advancements have taken place in the ECPR initiation techniques, in its device and in its postprocedure care ECPR is a team work requiring multidisciplinary experts, highly skilled health care workers and adequate infrastructure with appropriate devices Perfect coordination and communication among team members play a vital role in the outcome of the ECPR patients Ethical, legal and financial issues need to be considered before initiation of ECPR and while withdrawing the support when the ECPR is futile Numerous studies about ECPR are being published more frequently in the last few years Hence, keeping updated about the ECPR is very important for proper selection of cases and its management This article reviews various aspects of ECPR and relevant literature to date,,Natriuretic peptides are biomarkers of myocardial stress and are frequently elevated among patients with severe respiratory illnesses, typically in the absence of elevated cardiacfilling pressures or clinical heart failure Elevation of brain natriuretic peptide BNP or NTproBNP is associated with worse outcomes among patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ARDS We conducted a retrospective cohort study based on a comprehensive review of Electronic Medical Records EMRs of patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID19 to evaluate whether BNP on admission has prognostic value on mortality and hospital length of stay LOS among patients admitted with confirmed COVID19 along with the inclusion of additional prognostic variables Overall, 146 patients were included after analyzing 230 patients EMR and excluding potential confounding factors for abnormal BNP Our statistical analysis did not show a statistically significant association between BNP level and mortality rate P  0722 or ICU LOS  P  0741 A remarkable secondary outcome to our study was that impaired renal function GFR60 on admission was significantly associated with an increased mortality rate P  0026 and an increased ICU LOS P  0022 Although various studies have presented the predictive role of proBNP among patients with respiratory distress in the past years, our study did not find BNP to be an accurate predictive and prognostic factor among patients with COVID19 in our study population Renal impairment and high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation APACHE II scores on admission, on the other hand, have demonstrated to be strong predictors for COVID19 morbidity and mortality This study could represent an introduction to more prominent multicenter studies to evaluate additional prognostic factors and minimize the ordering of nonspecific testing,,Hypertension represents one of the most common preexisting conditions and comorbidities in Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 patients To explore whether hypertension serves as a risk factor for disease severity, a multicentre, retrospective study was conducted in COVID19 patients A total of 498 consecutively hospitalised patients with labconfirmed COVID19 in China were enrolled in this cohort Using logistic regression, we assessed the association between hypertension and the likelihood of severe illness with adjustment for confounders We observed that more than 16 of the enrolled patients exhibited preexisting hypertension on admission More severe COVID19 cases occurred in individuals with hypertension than those without hypertension 21 vs 10, P  0007 Hypertension associated with the increased risk of severe illness, which was not modified by other demographic factors, such as age, sex, hospital geological location and blood pressure levels on admission More attention and treatment should be offered to patients with underlying hypertension, who usually are older, have more comorbidities and more susceptible to cardiac complications,BackgroundThe impact of underlying chronic respiratory diseases CRDs on the risk and mortality of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 remains controversial We aimed to investigate the effects of CRDs on the risk of COVID19 and mortality among the population in South Korea MethodsThe NHISCOVID19 database in South Korea was used for data extraction for this populationbased cohort study Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD, asthma, interstitial lung disease ILD, lung cancer, lung disease due to external agents, obstructive sleep apnea OSA, and tuberculosis of the lungs TB were considered CRDs The primary endpoint was a diagnosis of COVID19 between January 1st and June 4th, 2020 the secondary endpoint was hospital mortality of patients with COVID19 Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used for statistical analysisResultsThe final analysis included 122,040 individuals, 7669 63 were confirmed as COVID19 until 4 June 2020, and 251 patients with COVID19 32 passed away during hospitalization Among total 122,040 individuals, 36,365 individuals were diagnosed with CRD between 2015 and 2019 COPD 4488, 36, asthma 33,858, 272, ILD 421, 03, lung cancer 769, 06, lung disease due to external agents 437, 04, OSA 550, 04, and TB 608, 05 Among the CRDs, patients either with ILD or OSA had 163fold odds ratio OR 163, 95 confidence interval CI 117226 Pu2009u20090004 and 165fold higher OR 165, 95 CI 123216 P,Observational studies suggest that a heart failure HF diagnosis carries a poor prognosis in subjects with severe SARSCoV2 COVID19 infection, but it is unknown whether this association reflects direct myocardial damage due to COVID19 or the consequence of preexisting cardiac defects and related cardiovascular disease CVD risk burden Although the close relation between CVD and COVID19 outcomes is well established, contrasting data exists about the occurrence of HF complications during COVID19 infection Therefore, a specific algorithm focused on diagnostic differentiation in acute patients distinguishing between acute HF and acute respiratory distress syndrome related to COVID19 is needed Further, several concerns exist for the management of patients with an uncertain diagnosis and acute dyspnea, the exact relationship existing between COVID19 and HF Therefore, the treatment for subjects with both COVID19 and HF and which criteria may be defined for domiciliary or hospital management, remain poorly defined Herein, we describe practices to be adopted in order to address these concerns and avoid further virus spread among patients, l and their familiars involved in such patients care,Computed tomography CT of the chest plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19, but it should not be used indiscriminately This review provides indications of CT chest in COVID19 suspect, positive and recovered patients based on the current scientific evidence and our personal experience CT chest is not indicated as a routine screening modality due to its poor sensitivity and specificity However, it is useful in a small subset of COVID19 suspects who test negative on reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction RTPCR with normalindeterminate chest Xray CXR but have moderatetosevere respiratory symptoms and high index of clinical suspicion CT chest is not indicated in every RTPCRpositive patient and should be done only in specific clinical scenarios, where it is expected to significantly contribute in the clinical management such as COVID19 patients showing unexplained clinical deterioration andor where other concurrent lung pathology or pulmonary thromboembolism needs exclusion Serial CXR and pointofcare ultrasound are usually sufficient to evaluate the progression of COVID19 pneumonia CT chest is also indicated in COVID19positive patients with associated comorbidities age 65 yr, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, immunecompromise, etc who, despite having mild symptoms and normalindeterminate CXR, record oxygen saturation of  93 per cent at rest while breathing room air or desaturate on sixminute walk test Finally, CT chest plays a crucial role to rule out lung fibrosis in patients recovered from COVID19 infection who present with hypoxiaimpaired lung function on follow up In conclusion, though CT chest is an indispensable diagnostic tool in COVID19, it should be used judiciously and only when specifically indicated,,,Acute respiratory distress syndrome and subsequent respiratory failure remains the leading cause of death 80 in patients severely impacted by COVID19 The lack of clinically effective therapies for COVID19 calls for the consideration of novel adjunct therapeutic approaches Though novel antiviral treatments and vaccination hold promise in control and prevention of early disease, it is noteworthy that in severe cases of COVID19, addressing runaway inflammatory cascades are likely more relevant for improvement of clinical outcomes Viral loads may decrease in severe, endstage coronavirus cases, but a systemically damaging cytokine storm persists and mediates multiple organ injury Remote ischemic conditioning RIC of the limbs has shown potential in recent years to protect the lungs and other organs against pathological conditions similar to that observed in COVID19 We review the efficacy of RIC in protecting the lungs against acute injury and current points of consideration The beneficial effects of RIC on lung injury along with other related cardiovascular complications are discussed, as are the limitations presented by sex and aging This adjunct therapy is highly feasible, noninvasive, and proven to be safe in clinical conditions If proven effective in clinical trials for acute respiratory distress syndrome and COVID19, application in the clinical setting could be immediately implemented to improve outcomes,BACKGROUND Recent studies have revealed that sustained ingestion of angiotensin converting enzymes inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers ACEIsARBs had no harmful effects on coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 patients complicated with hypertension AIM To investigate the impact on COVID19 patients complicated with hypertension who discontinued using ACEIsARBs METHODS All COVID19 patients complicated with hypertension admitted to our isolated unit were consecutively recruited in this study Some patients switched from ACEIsARBs to calcium channel blocker CCBs after admission, while others continued using nonACEIsARBs We compared characteristics and clinical outcomes between these two groups of patients RESULTS A total of 53 patients were enrolled, 27 patients switched from ACEIsARBs to CCBs while 26 patients continued with nonACEIsARBs After controlling potential confounding factors using the Cox proportional hazards model, hospital stay was longer in patients who discontinued ACEIsARBs, with a hazard ratio of 0424 95 confidence interval 01870962 P  0040, upon discharge than patients using other antihypertensive drugs A subgroup analysis showed that the effect of discontinuing use of ACEIsARBs was stronger in moderate cases hazard ratio  0224 95 confidence interval 00050998 P  00497 CONCLUSION Patients in the discontinued ACEIsARBs group had longer hospital stays Our findings suggest that COVID19 patients complicated with hypertension should continue to use ACEIsARBs,,Purpose Our aim is to correlate the clinical condition of patients with COVID19 infection with the 25point CT severity score by Chang et al devised for assessment of ARDS in patients with SARS in 2005 Materials and Methods Data of consecutive symptomatic patients who were suspected to have COVID19 infection and presented to our hospital were collected from March to April 2020 All patients underwent two consecutive RTPCR tests and had a noncontrast HRCT scan done at presentation From the original cohort of 1062 patients, 160 patients were excluded leaving a total number of 902 patients Results The mean age was 442u2009u2009119 years 853 males, 147 females CT severity score was found to be positively correlated with lymphopenia, increased serum CRP, ddimer, and ferritin levels p  00001 The oxygen requirements and length of hospital stay were increasing with the increase in scan severity Conclusion The 25point CT severity score correlates well with the COVID19 clinical severity Our data suggest that chest CT scoring system can aid in predicting COVID19 disease outcome and significantly correlates with lab tests and oxygen requirements,BackgroundA considerable number of SARSCoV2 infected individuals could be asymptomatic and dont need medical treatment The clinical spectrum of SARSCoV2 infection ranges from asymptomatic cases, mediumintensity forms with mild to moderate symptoms, to severe ones with bilateral pneumonia and respiratory distress In cases with severe presentation of SARSCoV2 infection, the induction of hypercoagulability is one of the pathophysiological mechanism that can contribute to deathCase presentationHere, we reported autoptic evidences of thrombotic pulmonary arterial fatal lesions in an asymptomatic COVID19 patient, after swab negativization Whole body complete postmortem examination was performed, showing the presence of a large thrombus occluding the main pulmonary artery that was the cause of death Histopathological analysis showed heterogeneous pattern of pathological changes in the lung tissue with numerous vascular thrombi, inflammatory cardiomyopathy and other histopathological modifications in kidneys, spleen and liverConclusionsThis study provides evidences that also asymptomatic patients may be at risk to develop thrombotic complications An appropriate diagnostic screening for thrombotic complications and the early treatment recommendations of antithrombotic drugs could represent an important topic even in asymptomatic individuals,,The angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2 is a type I integral membrane that was discovered two decades ago The ACE2 exists as a transmembrane protein and as a soluble catalytic ectodomain of ACE2, also known as the soluble ACE2 that can be found in plasma and other body fluids ACE2 regulates the local actions of the reninangiotensin system in cardiovascular tissues, and the ACE2Angiotensin 17 axis exerts protective actions in cardiovascular disease Increasing soluble ACE2 has been associated with heart failure, cardiovascular disease, and cardiac remodelling This is a review of the molecular structure and biochemical functions of the ACE2, as well we provided an updated on the evidence, clinical applications, and emerging potential therapies with the ACE2 in heart failure, cardiovascular disease, lung injury, and COVID19 infection,The correlation of clinical, radiological and laboratory findings of patients at admission in the Emergency Department ED with clinical severity and risk of mortality was investigated Adult coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 patients hospitalized in March 2020 in Desio Hospital, Lombardy, were retrospectively included in the study, and categorized in terms of disease severity and adverse outcome Out of the 175 patients enrolled, 79 presented one or more comorbidities, with cardiovascular disease being the most frequent 62 More than half of the patients showed lymphocytopenia and 20 thrombocytopenia The patients in the severe group presented higher absolute neutrophil count ANC, Creactive protein CRP, AST, LDH, procalcitonin PCT and BUN values compared to the nonsevere group pu2009u200905 Increased odds of mortality associated with older age OR  2243 95 CI 5229627, partial pressure of oxygen PaO2fraction of inspired oxygen FIO2 ratio  200 OR  497 95 CI 1551584, clinical severity OR  2132 95 CI 22720013, creatinine  10608u2009µmolL OR  287 95 CI 104792 and creatine kinase  290 µkatL OR  380 95 CI 131109 were observed on admission pu2009u200905 The above findings may contribute to identify early risk factors of poor prognosis, and to select the most appropriate management for patients,The risk of fatal arrhythmias is the major concern for using chloroquine CQ or hydroxychloroquine HCQ to treat coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19, but the reported number of lifethreatening arrhythmic events or deaths is relatively small The objective of this study was to assess the arrhythmogenic risk of these two drugs using a multiscale heart simulation, which allows testing even at high concentrations, including those that cause fatal arrhythmias We measured the inhibitory action of CQ, HCQ, and HCQ with 30xa0μM azithromycin AZ on six ion currents fast INa and late INa,L components of the sodium current, Ltype calcium current ICa,L, rapid IKrhERG, and slow IKs components of delayed rectifier potassium, and inward rectifier potassium IK1 over a wide range of concentrations using the automated patchclamp system Using the concentrationinhibition relationship that was thus obtained, we simulated the drug effects while increasing the concentration until the lifethreatening arrhythmia, torsade de pointes TdP, was observed The obtained threshold concentrations for TdP were 125, 35, and 225xa0μM for CQ, HCQ, and HCQ with AZ, respectively Adding therapeutic concentrations of mexiletine or verapamil successfully prevented the occurrence of TdP, and verapamil was more effective CQ, HCQ, and HCQ with AZ thresholds for TdP were larger than both antiviral concentrations that were reported by in vitro experiments and free plasma concentrations that were attained by the clinically used dosage The current simulation data provided a safety margin to the currently used clinical dose for CQ and HCQAZ,,Chest imaging, which includes Xray imaging and CT scan, is the main modality for assessing lung involvement in patients affected with the COVID19 virus Although CT is more sensitive, due to ease and affordability issues, Xrays are the preferred firstline study The aim of this article is to familiarize the treating physician with the imaging spectrum of the coronavirus lung infection on Xray and to discuss the frequency of these findings A total of 593 radiographs of admitted COVID19 patients RTPCR proven were retrospectively assessed in the study Demographics of admitted patients and COVID manifestations on chest radiographs were assessed Male to female ratio of patients in our study was 211 The largest number of patients was in the 50 to 60year age bracket 29 Forty percent of the Xrays in our study were negative No Xray showed findings exclusively in the upper zones, and 88 showed findings in the midlower zones Ground glass opacification was the commonest finding 75 of cases in abnormal Xrays The next most common findings were peripheral lung opacities and confluent consolidation Confluent consolidation, which indicates more severe disease, was observed in 15 of the abnormal Xrays The proportion of patients showing confluent consolidation was seen more in the older age groups u200950xa0years old with a peak in the 6070year age bracket Small reticular opacities, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and pleural effusions were uncommon findings in our study,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 is the causative agent of the global COVID19 pandemic and the lack of therapeutics hinders pandemic control 12  Although lung disease is the primary clinical outcome in COVID19 patients 13 , how SARSCoV2 induces tissue pathology in the lung remains elusive Here we describe a highthroughput platform to generate tens of thousands of selforganizing, nearly identical, and genetically matched human lung buds derived from human pluripotent stem cells hPSCs cultured on micropatterned substrates Strikingly, in vitro derived human lung buds resemble fetal human lung tissue and display in vivo like proximodistal coordination of alveolar and airway tissue differentiation whose 3D epithelial selforganization is directed by the levels of KGF Singlecell transcriptomics unveiled the cellular identities of airway and alveolar tissue and the differentiation of WNT hi cycling alveolar stem cells, a humanspecific lung cell type 4  These synthetic human lung buds are susceptible to infection by SARSCoV2 and endemic coronaviruses and can be used to track cell typedependent susceptibilities to infection, intercellular transmission and cytopathology in airway and alveolar tissue in individual lung buds Interestingly, we detected an increased susceptibility to infection in alveolar cells and identified cycling alveolar stem cells as targets of SARSCoV2 We used this platform to test neutralizing antibodies isolated from convalescent plasma that efficiently blocked SARSCoV2 infection and intercellular transmission Our platform offers unlimited, rapid and scalable access to diseaserelevant lung tissue that recapitulate key hallmarks of human lung development and can be used to track SARSCoV2 infection and identify candidate therapeutics for COVID19,,While coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19, caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2, has often been perceived as a predominantly respiratory condition, it is characterized by complications in multiple organ systems Especially the involvement of the cardiovascular system, along with the possibly severe pulmonary injury, is crucial for prognosis We identified three COVID19 patients with takotsubo TT cardiomyopathy at our infectious diseases treatment center and present their clinical, laboratory, echocardiographic, electrocardiographic, and angiographic features All patients were female median age, 67xa0years disease severity regarding COVID19 ranged from asymptomatic to ARDS adult respiratory syndrome necessitating mechanical ventilation for 22xa0days Angiography revealed normal coronary arteries in patient 1, severe threevessel coronary artery disease CAD in patient 2, and insignificant bystander CAD in patient 3 All patients showed classic apical hypokinesia with basal hyperkinesia In patient 3, TT cardiomyopathy resulted in transient cardiogenic shock Twentyeightday mortality was 0 in this case series In conclusion, takotsubo cardiomyopathy may be yet another clinical entity associated with SARSCoV2 infection,OBJECTIVES The study aimed to determine the knowledge and current practices of Nigerian physiotherapists on the physical activity and exercise training in the rehabilitation of patients with asthma and to determine if any difference exists between novice and expert professionals METHODS This was designed as a crosssectional study A total of 311 practicing physiotherapists in Nigeria participated in the study An electronic questionnaire comprising 34 semistructured questions with three domains personal information, knowledge, and current practices, was used to collect data throughout 4months Data were analyzed using a pragmatist paradigm RESULTS Out of the physiotherapists, 518 nu2009u2009161 had postgraduate degrees, 469 nu2009u2009146 had bachelors degrees, and 13 nu2009u20094 had a doctor of physiotherapy degrees The result also indicates that 453 nu2009u2009141 of the physiotherapists had insufficient knowledge about asthma, and 395 nu2009u2009123 were not using current clinical practice in the rehabilitation of patients with asthma The results also indicate that expert physiotherapist has more knowledge and also uses current practices when compared to novice physiotherapist CONCLUSIONS Even though expert physiotherapists have better knowledge and current practices when compared to the novice physiotherapists, the overall outcomes indicate that Nigerian physiotherapists had insufficient knowledge about asthma and were not using current clinical practice in the rehabilitation of patients with asthma,Background A rapid outbreak of novel coronavirus, COVID19, made it a global pandemic This study focused on the possible association between lymphopenia and Computed tomography CT scan features and COVID19 patient mortality Method The clinical data of 596 COVID19 patients were collected from February 2020 to September 2020 The patients serological survey and CT scan features were retrospectively explored Results The median age of the patients was 567164 years old Lung involvement was more than 50 in 214 COVID19 patients 359 The average blood lymphocyte percentage was 2035 1016 The levels of Creactive protein CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate ESR, and platelettolymphocyte ratio PLR may not indicate the severity and prognosis of COVID19 Patients with severe lung involvement and lymphopenia were found to be significantly associated with increased odds of death odds ratio OR, 924 95 confidence interval 95 CI, 432 1978 These results indicated that lymphopenia 20 along with pulmonary involvement 50 impose a multiplicative effect on the risk of mortality The inhospital mortality rate of this group was significantly higher than other COVID19 hospitalized cases Furthermore, they meaningfully experienced a prolonged stay in the hospital P 000 Conclusion The Lymphocyte count less than 20 and chest CT scan findings with more than 50 involvement might be related to the patients mortality It could act as laboratory and clinical indicators of disease severity and mortality,Corresponding Author,Background  The unpredictability of the progression of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 may be attributed to the low precision of the tools used to predict the prognosis of this disease   Objective  To identify the predictors associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients with COVID19   Methods  Relevant articles from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science were searched as of April 5, 2020 The quality of the included papers was appraised using the NewcastleOttawa scale NOS Data of interest were collected and evaluated for their compatibility for the metaanalysis Cumulative calculations to determine the correlation and effect estimates were performed using the Z test   Results  In total, 19 papers recording 1,934 mild and 1,644 severe cases of COVID19 were included Based on the initial evaluation, 62 potential risk factors were identified for the metaanalysis Several comorbidities, including chronic respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension were observed more frequent among patients with severe COVID19 than with the mild ones Compared to the mild form, severe COVID19 was associated with symptoms such as dyspnea, anorexia, fatigue, increased respiratory rate, and high systolic blood pressure Lower levels of lymphocytes and hemoglobin elevated levels of leukocytes, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, blood creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, highsensitivity troponin, creatine kinase, highsensitivity Creactive protein, interleukin 6, Ddimer, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and procalcitonin and a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate were also associated with severe COVID19   Conclusion  More than 30 risk factors are associated with a higher risk of severe COVID19 These may serve as useful baseline parameters in the development of prediction tools for COVID19 prognosis,Abstract  Introduction A significant number of patients continue to recover from COVID19 however, little is known about the lung function capacity among survivors We aim to determine the longterm impact on lung function capacity in patients who have survived moderate or severe COVID19 disease in a resourcepoor setting   Methods and analysis This prospective cohort study will include patients aged 15 years and above and have reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction RTPCR positive for COVID 19 nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal Patients with a preexisting diagnosis of obstructive or interstitial lung disease, lung fibrosis and cancers, connective tissue disorders, autoimmune conditions affecting the lungs, underlying heart disease, history of syncope and refuse to participate will be excluded Pulmonary function will be assessed using spirometry and diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide DLCO at three and sixmonths interval A chest Xray at three and sixmonth followup and CTchest will be performed if clinically indicated after consultation with the study pulmonologist or Infectious Disease ID physician Echocardiogram ECHO to look for pulmonary hypertension at the three months visit and repeated at six months if any abnormality is identified initially Data analysis will be performed using standard statistical software   Ethics and dissemination The proposal was reviewed and approved by ethics review committee ERC of the institution ERC reference number 2020473511311 Informed consent will be obtained from each study participant The results will be disseminated among study participants, institutional, provincial and national level through seminars and presentations Moreover, the scientific findings will be published in highimpact peerreviewed medical journals   Strengths and Limitations of this study    The study has the potential to develop contextspecific evidence on the longterm impact on lung function among COVID19 survivors    Findings will play key role in understanding the impact of the disease on vital functions and help devise rehabilitative strategies to best overcome the effects of disease    This is a singlecenter, study recruiting only a limited number of COVID19 survivors    The study participants may losstofollow up due to uncertain conditions and disease reemergence,The coronavirus disease 19 COVID19 pandemic poses a serious global threat to human health and the economy Based on accumulating evidence, its continuous progression involves not only pulmonary injury but also damage to the cardiovascular system due to intertwined pathophysiological risks As a point of convergence in the pathophysiologic process between COVID19 and heart failure HF, cytokine storm induces the progression of COVID19 in patients presenting preexisting or new onset myocardial damage and even HF Cytokine storm, as a trigger of the progression of HF in patients with COVID19, has become a novel focus to explore therapies for target populations In this review, we briefly introduce the basis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 and illuminate the mechanism and links among COVID19, cytokine storm, and HF Furthermore, we discuss drugs and therapeutic targets for patients with COVID19 and HF,This letter addresses our concerns regarding the paper entitled The risk of induced cancer and ischemic heart disease following low dose lung irradiation for COVID19 estimation based on a virtua,Although SARSCoV2 is considered a lungtropic virus, severe COVID19 is not just a viral pulmonary infection, clinically it is a multiorgan pathology with major coagulation abnormalities and thromboembolism events Recently, antiphospholipid aPL antibodies were found increased in a large number of COVID19 patients Elevated aPL have been well documented in antiphospholipid syndrome APS, a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by recurrent venous or arterial thrombosis andor obstetrical morbidity Among treatment regimen of APS, hydroxychloroquine HCQ is one of the molecules proposed in the primary prevention of thrombosis and obstetrical morbidity in those patients Due to its antithrombotic properties documented in APS therapy, HCQ could be considered a good candidate for the prevention of thrombotic events in COVID19 patients in association with anticoagulant and its repurposing deserves further evaluation,,Secretome derived from human amniotic fluid stem cells AFSCS is rich in soluble bioactive factors SBF and offers untapped therapeutic potential for regenerative medicine while avoiding putative cellrelated complications Characterization and optimal generation of AFSCS remains challenging We hypothesized that modulation of oxygen conditions during AFSCS generation enriches SBF and confers enhanced regenerative and cardioprotective effects on cardiovascular cells We collected secretome at 6hourly intervals up to 30xa0h following incubation of AFSC in normoxic 21O2, nAFSCS and hypoxic 1O2, hAFSCS conditions Proliferation of human adult cardiomyocytes hCM and umbilical cord endothelial cells HUVEC incubated with nAFSCS or hAFSCS were examined following culture in normoxia or hypoxia Lower AFSC counts and richer protein content in AFSCS were observed in hypoxia Characterization of AFSCS by multiplex immunoassay showed higher concentrations of proangiogenic and antiinflammatory SBF hCM demonstrated highest proliferation with 30hhAFSCS in hypoxic culture The cardioprotective potential of concentrated 30hhAFSCS treatment was demonstrated in a myocardial ischemiareperfusion injury mouse model by infarct size and cell apoptosis reduction and cell proliferation increase when compared to saline treatment controls Thus, we project that hypoxicgenerated AFSCS, with higher proangiogenic and antiinflammatory SBF, can be harnessed and refined for tailored regenerative applications in ischemic cardiovascular disease,ABSTRACT  Objectives The risk of myocardial damage after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 infection has been controversial There is an urgent need for data to support the appropriate level of cardiovascular screening for safe returntoplay The purpose of this study is to report the incidence of abnormal cardiovascular findings in National Collegiate Athletic Association NCAA Division I studentathletes with a history of SARSCoV2 infection   Methods This is a case series of studentathletes at a single NCAA Division I institution who tested positive for SARSCoV2 by polymerase chain reaction PCR or antibody testing IgG from 4152020 to 10312020 From 452 athletes who were screened, 5,124 PCR and 452 antibody tests were completed Studentathletes were followed through 12312020 median 104 days, range 64182 days Cardiac workup included clinical evaluation, troponin level, electrocardiogram ECG, and echocardiogram Additional workup was ordered as clinically indicated   Results 55 studentathletes tested positive for SARSCoV2 Of these, 38 69 had symptoms of Coronavirus Disease COVID19, 14 26 had a positive IgG test, and 41 74 had a positive PCR test Eight abnormal cardiovascular screening evaluations necessitated further testing including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging cMRI Two athletes received new cardiac diagnoses, one probable early cardiomyopathy and one pericarditis, while the remaining six had normal cardiac MRIs   Conclusion These data support recent publications which recommend the deescalation of cardiovascular testing for athletes who have recovered from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARSCoV2 infection Continued followup of these athletes for sequelae of SARSCoV2 is critical,Background Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes CFRD is a frequent comorbidity of patients with Cystic Fibrosis CF A worsening of clinical conditions appears before CFRD It has been demonstrated a decline in pulmonary function and nutritional status also in patients with prediabetes Few trials show that insulin may be beneficial in prediabetic CF patients, to date guidelines do not recommended for this condition Case presentation we report a case of a patient treated with insulin glargine at 13, due to glycemic intolerance, and with LumacaftorIvacaftor at 15 A reduction of pulmonary exacerbations was observed after glargine therapy, also confirmed after the starting of Lumacaftor Ivacaftorxa0in this patient Pulmonary function improved only after the first year of glargine therapy, then a deterioration appeared due to the natural history of CF lung damage During the COVID19 lockdown, poor adherence to care contributed to diabetes onset needing high insulin requirements After two weeks the patient returned to prediabetic condition and his previous dose of glargine Conclusions our case highlights firstly that insulin glargine has contributed to preserve him from further clinical worsening due to prediabetes in the years before pandemic, secondly the negative impact of COVID19 lockdown on the clinical course of a chronic disease as CF,Morbidity, mortality and economic burden caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD is a significant global concern Surprisingly, COPD is already the third leading cause of death worldwide, something that WHO had not predicted to occur until 2030 It is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airway limitation due to airway andor alveolar abnormalities usually caused by significant exposure to noxious particles of gases Neutrophil is one of the key infiltrated innate immune cells in the lung during the pathogenesis of COPD Neutrophils during pathogenic attack or injury decide to undergo for a suicidal death by releasing decondensed chromatin entangled with antimicrobial peptides to trap and ensnare pathogens Casting neutrophil extracellular traps NETs has been widely demonstrated to be an effective mechanism against invading microorganisms thus controlling overwhelming infections However, aberrant and massive NETs formation has been reported in several pulmonary diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Moreover, NETs can directly induce epithelial and endothelial cell death resulting in impairing pulmonary function and accelerating the progression of the disease Therefore, understanding the regulatory mechanism of NET formation is the need of the hour in order to use NETs for beneficial purpose and controlling their involvement in disease exacerbation For example, DNA neutralization of NET proteins using protease inhibitors and disintegration with recombinant human DNase would be helpful in controlling excess NETs Targeting CXC chemokine receptor 2 CXCR2 would also reduce neutrophilic inflammation, mucus production and neutrophilproteinase mediated tissue destruction in lung In this review, we discuss the interplay of NETs in the development and pathophysiology of COPD and how these NETs associated therapies could be leveraged to disrupt NETopathic inflammation as observed in COPD, for better management of the disease,Background New coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 has posed a severe threat to human life and caused a global pandemic The current research aimed to explore whether the searchengine query patterns could serve as a potential tool for monitoring the outbreak of COVID19Methods We collected the number of COVID19 confirmed cases between January 11, 2020, and April 22, 2020, from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering CSSE at Johns Hopkins University JHU The search index values of the most common symptoms of COVID19 eg, fever, cough, fatigue were retrieved from the Baidu Index Spearmans correlation analysis was used to analyze the association between the Baidu index values for each COVID19related symptom and the number of confirmed cases Regional distributions among 34 provinces regions in China were also analyzedResults Daily growth of confirmed cases and Baidu index values for each COVID19related symptom presented robust positive correlations during the outbreak fever rs0705, p9623×106 cough rs0592, p4485×104 fatigue rs0629, p1494×104 sputum production rs0648, p8206×105 shortness of breath rs0656, p6182×105 The average searchtoconfirmed interval STCI was 198 days in China The daily Baidu Index values optimal time lags were the four days for cough, two days for fatigue, three days for sputum production, one day for shortness of breath, and 0 days for feverConclusion The searches of COVID19related symptoms on the Baidu search engine were significantly correlated to the number of confirmed cases Since the Baidu search engine could reflect the publics attention to the pandemic and the regional epidemics of viruses, relevant departments need to pay more attention to areas with high searches of COVID19related symptoms and take precautionary measures to prevent these potentially infected persons from further spreading,Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 caused more than 52775271 million confirmed cases, 1293106 deaths, globally, and afflicted 208 countries, areas, or territories and almost three months have passed since the World Health Organisation WHO declared COVID19 as a pandemic Despite the dramatic and global impact of the Coronavirus, the knowledge about the SARSCoV2 infection has been improved remarkably Herein, we provided the rationale for SARSCoV2 infection as endothelial dysfunction rather than respiratory disease Accordingly, we strongly invited the researchers to look beyond pulmonary injury and shift their attention from respiratory disease to endothelial disorder This strategy could be particularly relevant to identifying therapeutic weapons stabilizing the endothelium rather than the lungs,CASE PRESENTATION A 28yearold man presented with shortness of breath, chest pain, and scant hemoptysis Three weeks previously, he was admitted for coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia that had been diagnosed by nasal swab polymerase chain reaction Chest CT imaging demonstrated bilateral groundglass opacities without evidence of VTE He was treated with hydroxychloroquine, up to 7 Lmin oxygen, and selfproning After 8xa0days of hospitalization, he was discharged on 4 Lmin oxygen After discharge, his symptoms and hypoxia resolved,This article presents preliminary results of treatment of 51 patients with COVID 19 Moscow Region, Russia These patients were subjected to various schemes of immune stimulation for the prevention and treatment of this disease Were comparedPercutaneus laser therapy PLT, Intravenous Laser Blood Irradiation ILBI, Drug stimulation and their combination The results showed 1 In the treatment of COVID19, the use of various types of immunomodulation and anticoagulants proved to be most effective 2 The combination of ILBI and TLT with immunomodulators proved to be the most effective in the prevention and treatment of COVID19 3 Immediate use of immunomodulators at the very beginning of COVID19 reduces the severity of the disease, and facilitates its course Background and Aims We started to use laser therapy in 1988 When used in different categories of cancer patients, it was found that various types of laser radiation stimulate the immune system We started to use this peculiarity of laser therapy to boost the immune status of sickly patients with weakened immune systems, as well as for prevention and treatment of respiratory viral infections eg influenza, parainfluenza, acute respiratory infections We performed various types of Immunostimulation in 51 patients from Russia and evaluated its influence both on the morbidity and the course of COVID19 Rationale Laser radiation 890910 nm stimulates cell immunity, increasing the amount of active Tlymphocytes The wavelength of 630640 nm is the most effective for irradiation both the blood and the vascular walls At this wavelength photons are absorbed by oxygen, microcirculation improves, decrease blood viscosity, and direct impact on the nerve and muscle elements of the vascular wall influences the activity of the vascular and nervous systems Conclusion The laser therapy practice we have been exercising for over 30 years has shown that it produces good immunostimulating effects The use of various laser therapy methods combined with immunomodulatory drugs allow to reduce the number of patients infected with COVID19, and reduce the severity of the disease,On page 36, in the fifth sentence of rightside column, where it reads Direct thrombin inhibitors

equipment was used during all the procedures Total 29 Pediatric patients age ranging from 1xa0day to 13xa0years underwent procedures due to history of foreign body inhalation ingestion, insertion and compromised airway in form of immediate endotracheal intubation were included Comprehensively we recommend intervention only in emergency procedures during pandemic, use of personal protective equipment during all procedures, preoperative investigations for diagnosis and modifications in operation theatre, anesthesia and surgical techniques to reduce aerosols generation will minimize risk of infection transmission to health care workers,Posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD has been associated with accelerated progression of coronary heart disease CHD However, the underlying pathophysiological pathway has remained elusive and it is unclear whether there is a direct link between PTSD and CHD risk This paper describes the methods of a randomized controlled trial developed to examine how changes in PTSD symptoms affect CHD disease pathways One hundred twenty participants with current PTSD and who are free of known CHD will be randomized to receive either an evidencebased treatment for PTSD Cognitive Processing Therapy CPT or a waitlist control WL Before and after CPTWL, participants undergo assessment of CHD risk biomarkers reflecting autonomic nervous system dysregulation, systemic inflammation, and vascular endothelial dysfunction The primary hypothesis is that individuals who show improvement in PTSD symptoms will show improvement in CHD risk biomarkers, whereas individuals who fail to improve or show worsening PTSD symptoms will have no change or worsening in CHD biomarkers This study is expected to provide knowledge of the role of both the direct impact of PTSD symptoms on CHD risk pathways and the role of these systems as candidate mechanisms underlying the relationship between PTSD and CHD risk Further, results will provide guidance on the utility of cognitive therapy as a tool to mitigate the accelerated progression of CHD in PTSD Clinical Trials Registration httpsclinicaltrialsgovct2showNCT02736929 Unique identifier NCT02736929,PURPOSE OF REVIEW COVID19 lung injury is a common manifestation of severe illness Lung tissue examination has been largely derived from autopsy  a combination of case reports, small and moderately sized series with international scope Common and uncommon histopathology provides insight into the progression of severe, fatal disease RECENT FINDINGS COVID19 lung histology is most commonly diffuse alveolar damage as part of acute respiratory distress syndrome Lung injury can be temporally heterogeneous, with patterns of healing alongside new injury Viral studies, including immunohistochemistry, RNA insitu hybridization, and tissuebased Polymerase chain reaction PCR assist in discerning complications of therapy eg ventilatorassociated pneumonia from primary viralinduced injury Response to viral infection produces systemic effects, and one major manifestation is thrombosis of microcirculation and larger vessels Less common patterns include neutrophilrich inflammation, raising speculation that neutrophil extracellular traps may play a role in both viral control and exaggerated immune response SUMMARY The heterogeneity of fatal cases persistence of viral infection in lung, clearance of virus but severe lung injury, thrombosis, and exaggerated immune response  suggest that antiviral, antithrombotic, antiinflammatory, and supportive therapy play a role in treatment, but that the patientspecific cause and timing of the lung injury is important in choosing intervention,Introduction SARSCoV2, the virus responsible for the current pandemic, predominantly affects the respiratory tract, and a growing number of publications report the predisposition of patients with COVID19 to develop thrombotic phenomena Objective To determine the prevalence of pulmonary embolism in patients with COVID19 to determine the possible relationship between the severity of pulmonary involvement and ddimer levels to analyze the location of pulmonary embolisms in patients with COVID19 and to compare it with the location in patients without COVID19 Methods This retrospective study analyzed all CT angiograms of the pulmonary arteries done in patients with suspected pulmonary embolisms between March 15 and April 30, 2020 and compared them with studies done in the same period one year earlier Results We included 492 pulmonary CT angiograms 342 699 in patients with COVID19 and 147 301 in patients without COVID19 The prevalence of pulmonary embolisms was higher in patients with COVID19 26 vs 163 in patients without COVID19, pu202fu202f00197 relative risku202fu202f16 The prevalence of pulmonary embolisms in the same period in 2019 was 132, similar to that of the group of COVID19negative patients in 2020 pu202fu202f043 There were no significant differences in ddimer levels or the location of pulmonary embolisms between the two groups CT showed moderate or severe pulmonary involvement in 787 of the patients with COVID19 Conclusions Patients with COVID19 have an increased prevalence of pulmonary embolisms 26, and most 787 have moderate or severe lung involvement on CT studies The location of pulmonary embolisms and the degree of elevation of ddimer levels does not differ between patients with COVID19 and those without,Background Solid data on cardiovascular derangements in critically ill COVID19 patients remain scarce The aim of this study is to describe hemodynamic characteristics in a cohort of COVID19related critically ill patients Methods A retrospective observational cohort study in twentyeight consecutive mechanically ventilated COVID19 patients Pulse contour analysisderived data were obtained from all patients, using the PiCCO system Results The mean arterial pressure increased from 77u2009u200910u2009mmHg on day 1 to 84u2009u20099u2009mmHg on day 21 p004, in combination with the rapid tapering and cessation of norepinephrine and the gradual use of antihypertensive drugs in the vast majority of patients The cardiac index increased significantly from 28u2009u200907u2009Lminm2 on day 1 to 40u2009u200908u2009Lminm2 on day 21 p  0001 Dobutamine was administered in only two patients Mean markers of left ventricular contractility and peripheral perfusion, as well as lactate levels, remained within the normal range Despite a constant fluid balance, extravascular lung water index decreased significantly from 17u2009u20097u2009mLkg on day 1 to 11u2009u20094u2009mLkg on day 21 p  0001 Simultaneously, intrapulmonary righttoleft shunt fraction Q sQ t decreased significantly from 27u2009u200910 in week 1 to 15u2009u20099 in week 3 p0007 PaO2FiO2 ratio improved from 159u2009u200953u2009mmHg to 319u2009u200953u2009mmHg p  0001, but static lung compliance remained unchanged Conclusions In general, this cohort of patients with COVID19 respiratory failure showed a marked rise in blood pressure over time, not accompanied by distinctive markers of circulatory failure Characteristically, increased extravascular lung water, vascular permeability, and intrapulmonary shunt diminished over time, concomitant with an improvement in gas exchange,Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia HHT also known as OslerWeberRendu syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder affecting 1 in 8000 individuals The eponym recognises the 19thcentury physicians William Osler, Henri Jules Louis Marie Rendu and Frederick Parkes Weber who each independently described the disease It is characterised by epistaxis, telangiectasia and visceral arteriovenous malformations Individuals with HHT have been found to have abnormal plasma concentrations of transforming growth factor beta and vascular endothelial growth factor secondary to mutations in ENG, ACVRL1 and MADH4 Pulmonary artery malformations PAVMs are abnormal communications between pulmonary arteries and veins and are found in up to 50 of individuals with HHT The clinical features suggestive of PAVMs are stigmata of right to left shunting such as dyspnoea, hypoxaemia, cyanosis, cerebral embolism and unexplained haemoptysis or haemothorax The authors present the case of a 33yearold woman presenting with progressive dyspnoea during the COVID19 pandemic She had a typical presentation of HHT with recurrent epistaxis, telangiectasia and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations Although rare, PAVM should be considered in individuals presenting to the emergency department with dyspnoea and hypoxaemia Delayed diagnosis can result in fatal embolic and haemorrhagic complications,,PurposeTo analyze pulmonary embolism PE on chest computed tomography pulmonary angiography CTPA in hospitalized patients affected by SARSCoV2, according to the severity of lung disease based both on temporal CT features changes and on CTseverity lung involvement CTseverity score, along with the support of clinical and laboratory findingsMethodsWe retrospectively enrolled a total of 170 patients with confirmed SARSCoV2 infection who underwent CTPA examination for PE suspicion Pulmonary arteries diameters, right ventricleleft ventricle RVLV ratio, presence, absence, and distribution of PE, pulmonary artery obstructive index PAO index, and lobe involvement were recorded All CT scans were reviewed to assess temporal CT changes and the COVID CTseverity scoreResultsA total of 76 out of 170 patients 447 developed PE without having any major risk factors for venous thromboembolism The most severe pulmonary arteries involvement, expressed in terms of PAO Index, occurred in those patients with markedly elevated Ddimer and Creactive protein CRP values and those patients with an advanced temporal stage of lung disease The majority PEpositive patients were hospitalized in nonintensive wards PEpositive patients showed a slightly higher hospitalization time in comparison with PEnegative ones In the three months of study, overall 859 of patients were discharged while 141 died, of whom 13 PEpositive 542ConclusionsPatients hospitalized for SARSCoV2 infection present a higher cumulative incidence of PE compared to the general population of hospitalized patients, regardless of the severity of lung inflammation or the temporal stage of the disease,The aim is to explore the relation between inflammationassociated factors and inhospital mortality and investigate which factor is an independent predictor of inhospital death in patients with coronavirus disease2019 This study included patients with coronavirus disease2019, who were hospitalized between February 9, 2020, and March 30, 2020 Univariate Cox regression analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression LASSO were used to select variables Multivariate Cox regression analysis was applied to identify independent risk factors in coronavirus disease2019 A total of 1135 patients were analyzed during the study period A total of 35 variables were considered to be risk factors after the univariate regression analysis of the clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters p,Patients with COVID19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARSCoV2 demonstrate high rates of coinfection with respiratory viruses, including influenza A IAV, suggesting pathogenic interactions We investigated how IAV may increase the risk for COVID19 lung disease, focusing on the receptor Angiotensin Convertase Enzyme 2 ACE2 and the protease TMPRSS2, which cooperate to uptake SARSCoV2 intracellular We found, using single cell RNA sequencing of distal human nondiseased lung homogenates, that at baseline, ACE2 is minimally expressed in basal, goblet, ciliated, and secretory epithelial cells populating small airways We focused on human small airway epithelial cells SAEC, central to the pathogenesis of lung injury following viral infections Primary SAEC from nondiseased donor lungs apically infected at airliquid interface with IAV up to 3×105u2005pfu ∼1 MOI markedly 8fold boosted the expression of ACE2, paralleling that of STAT1, a transcription factor activated by viruses IAV increased the apparent electrophoretic mobility of intrac¬ellular ACE2 and generated an ACE2 fragment 90u2005kDa in apical secretions, suggesting cleavage of this receptor IAV also increased the expression of two proteases known to cleave ACE2, sheddase ADAM17 TACE and TMPRSS2 and increased the TMPRSS2 zymogen and its mature fragments, implicating proteolytic autoactivation These results indicate that IAV amplifies the expression of molecules necessary for SARSCoV2 infection of the distal lung Further, posttranslational changes in ACE2 by IAV may increase the vulnerability to lung injury such as ARDS during viral coinfections These findings support prevention and treatment efforts of influenza infections during the COVID19 pandemic,BackgroundPneumonia induced by 2019 Coronavirus COVID19 is characterized by hypoxemic respiratory failure that may present with a broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes At the beginning, patients may have normal lung compliance and be responsive to noninvasive ventilatory support, such as CPAP However, the transition to more severe respiratory failure  Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome SARSCoV2, necessitating invasive ventilation is often abrupt and characterized by a severe VQ mismatch that require cycles of prone positioning The aim of this case is to report the effect on gas exchange, respiratory mechanics and hemodynamics of tripod or orthopneic sitting position used as an alternative to prone position in a patient with mild SARSCoV2 pneumonia ventilated with helmet CPAPCase presentationA 77yearold awake and collaborating male patient with mild SARSCoV2 pneumonia and ventilated with Helmet CPAP, showed sudden worsening of gas exchange without dyspnea After an unsuccessful attempt of prone positioning, we alternated threehoursu2009cycles of semirecumbent and tripod position, still keeping him in CPAP Arterial blood gases PaO2FiO2, PaO2, SaO2, PaCO2 and Aa gradient, respiratory VE, VT, RR and hemodynamic parameters HR, MAP were collected in the supine and tripod position Cycles of tripod position were continued for 3 days The patient had a clinically important improvement in arterial blood gases and respiratory parameters, with stable hemodynamic and was successfully weaned and discharged to ward 10 days after pneumonia onsetConclusionsTripod position during Helmet CPAP can be applied safely in patients with mild SARSCoV2 pneumonia, with improvement of oxygenation and VQ matching, thus reducing the need for intubation,,The purpose of this case report is to demonstrate lung perfusion changes on dualenergy CT DECT in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 Since the first case of COVID19 was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province in China, the spectrum of lung parenchymal findings has been well described but the underlying pathophysiology is less well understood DECT imaging contributes to the growing evidence that vascular dysregulation has an important role in the underlying pathophysiology of the disease Three patients with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction RTPCRconfirmed COVID19 underwent DECT scans One patient had a DECT for persistent spikes in temperature while the other two patients underwent dualenergy CT pulmonary angiograms CTPA for worsening shortness of breath, elevated D dimers and suspected pulmonary embolism The perfusion abnormalities include focal areas of both hyperperfusion, hypoperfusion, and areas of hypoperfusion surrounded by hyperemia In addition, dilatation of segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries was seen in relation to the lung parenchymal change DECT has proven useful in supporting the hypothesis that vascular dysregulation plays a significant role in the pulmonary pathophysiology of COVID19 Early identification and axa0high index of suspicion xa0is required in the emergency department setting to identify and isolate cases even prior to the results of RTPCR test being available Vascular changes on DECT may be an additional radiological feature in detecting the presence of and predicting the severity of disease in the emergency department or acute care setting,The persistence of macrophagederived foam cells in the artery wall fuels atherosclerosis development However, the mechanism of foam cell formation regulation remains elusive We are committed to determining the role that CD147 might play in macrophage foam cell formation during atherosclerosis In this study, we found that CD147 expression was primarily increased in mouse and human atherosclerotic lesions that were rich in macrophages and could be upregulated by oxLDL Highthroughput compound screening indicated that oxLDLinduced CD147 upregulation in macrophages was achieved through PI3KAktmTOR signaling Genetic deletion of macrophage CD147 protected against foam cell formation by impeding cholesterol uptake, probably through the scavenger receptor CD36 The opposite effect was observed in primary macrophages isolated from macrophagespecific CD147overexpressing mice Moreover, bioinformatics results indicated that CD147 suppression might exert an atheroprotective effect via various processes, such as cholesterol biosynthetic and metabolic processes, LDL and plasma lipoprotein clearance, and decreased platelet aggregation and collagen degradation Our findings identify CD147 as a potential target for prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis in the future,PurposeThe aims of our study are 1 to estimate admission chest Xray CXR accuracy during the descending phase of pandemic 2 to identify specific CXR findings strictly associated with COVID19 infection and 3 to correlate lung involvement of admission CXR with patients outcomeMaterials and methodsWe prospectively evaluated the admission CXR of 327 patients accessed to our institute during the Italian pandemic descending phase April 2020 For each CXR were searched ground glass opacification GGO, consolidation CO, reticularnodular opacities RNO, nodules, excavations, pneumothorax, pleural effusion, vascular congestion and cardiac enlargement For lung alterations was defined the predominance upper or basal, focal or diffuse, central or peripheric, etc Then radiologists assessed whether CXRs were suggestive or not for COVID19 infection For COVID19 patients, a prognostic score was applied and correlated with the patients outcomeResultsCXR showed 83 of specificity and 60 of sensitivity GGO, CO, RNO and a peripheric, diffuse and basal prevalence showed good correlation with COVID19 diagnosis A logistic regression analysis pointed out GGO and a basal or diffuse distribution as independent predictors of COVID19 diagnosis The prognostic score showed good correlation with the patients outcomeConclusionIn our study, admission CXR showed a fair specificity and a good correlation with patients outcome GGO and others CXR findings showed a good correlation with COVID19 diagnosis besides GGO a diffuse or bibasal distribution resulted in independent variables highly suggestive for COVID19 infection thus enabling radiologists to signal to clinicians radiologically suspect patients during the pandemic descending phase,In the present study, a prediction model with combined laboratory indexes in risk stratification of patients with COVID19 was established and tested The data of 170 patients with COVID19 who were divided into an asymptomaticmoderate group 141 cases and severe or above group 29 cases were retrospectively analyzed The clinical characteristics and laboratory indexes of the two groups were compared Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to construct the prediction model based on laboratory indexes A receiver operating characteristic ROC curve analysis was used to compare the diagnostic efficacy of different indexes Decision curve analysis DCA was performed to quantify and compare the clinical validity of the prediction models There were significant differences in blood cell count, highsensitivity Creactive protein hsCRP and procalcitonin PCT levels between the severe or above group and the asymptomaticmoderate group all P005 Among all individual indexes, hsCRP had the highest diagnostic efficacy area under the curve0870, with a sensitivity and specificity of 0828 and 0802, respectively The red blood cell count, hsCRP and PCT were used to construct the prediction model The AUC of the prediction model was higher than that of hsCRP 0912 vs 0870 but the difference was not significant P0307 DCA suggested that the net benefit of the prediction model was higher than that of hsCRP in most cases and significantly higher than that of PCT, lymphocytes and monocytes The prediction model with combined laboratory indexes was able to more effectively predict the clinical classification of patients with COVID19 and may be used as a tool for risk stratification of patients,Transplantation of solid organs and hematopoietic stem cells represents an important therapeutic option for axa0variety of endstage pulmonary diseases, aggressive hematopoietic neoplasms, or severe immunodeficiencies Although the overall survival following transplantation has generally improved over recent decades, longtime survival of lung and stemcell transplant recipients is still alarmingly low with an average 5‑year survival rate of only 5060 Chronic alloimmunoreactions in general and pulmonary alloimmunoreactions with subsequent fibrosis in particular are major reasons for this poor outcome Comparable patterns of fibrotic lung remodeling are observed following both lung and hematopoietic stemcell transplantation Besides the meanwhile wellestablished obliterative and functionally obstructive remodeling of the small airways  obliterative bronchiolitis  axa0specific restrictive subform of fibrosis, namely alveolar fibroelastosis, has been identified Despite their crucial impact on patient outcome, both entities can be very challenging to detect by conventional histopathological analysis Their underlying mechanisms are considered overreaching aberrant repair attempts to acute lung injuries with overactivation of myo fibroblasts and excessive and irreversible deposition of extracellular matrix Of note, the underlying molecular mechanisms are widely divergent between these two morphological entities and are independent of the underlying clinical settingFurther comprehensive investigations of these fibrotic alterations are key to the development of muchneeded predictive diagnostics and curative concepts, considering the high mortality of pulmonary fibrosis following transplantation,The coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic has affected millions of people worldwide The manifestations of COVID19 infection can range from being asymptomatic to developing severe acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS Here, we present a case series of five patients who were either asymptomatic or had very mild symptoms of COVID19 infection upon diagnosis These patients neither required a visit to the emergency department ED nor did they needxa0to be hospitalized but became symptomatic and were found to have interstitial lung disease four to eight weeks after a COVID19 diagnosis Thus, it is imperative that we routinely follow up patients with a subclinical COVID 19 infection besides those who were symptomatic We may be witnessing a silent surge and newonset interstitial lung disease ILD as sequelae of COVID 19 infection,Majority of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus infection COVID19 exhibit mild symptoms Identification of COVID19 patients with mild symptoms who might develop into severe or critical illness is essential to save lives We conducted an observational study in a dedicated makeshift hospital for adult male COVID19 patients with mild symptoms between February and March 2020 Baseline characteristics, medical history, and clinical presentation were recorded Laboratory tests and chest computed tomography were performed Patients were observed until they were either transferred to a hospital for advanced care owing to disease exacerbation or were discharged after improvement Patients were grouped based on their chest imaging findings or shortterm outcomes A total of 125 COVID19 patients with mild symptoms were enrolled Of these, 7 patients were transferred for advanced care while 118 patients were discharged after improvement and showed no disease recurrence during an additional 28day followup period Eightyfive patients 680 had abnormal chest imaging findings Patients with abnormal chest imaging findings were more likely to have disease deterioration and require advanced care as compared to those with normal chest imaging findings Patients with deteriorated outcomes were more likely to have low peripheral blood oxygen saturation and moderatelyelevated body temperature There were no significant differences between patients with deteriorated or improved outcomes with respect to age, comorbidities, or other clinical symptoms including nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, hemoptysis, sputum production, shortness of breath, fatigue, headache, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea Abnormal chest imaging findings, low peripheral blood oxygen saturation, and elevated temperature were associated with disease deterioration in adult male COVID19 patients with mild clinical symptoms Clinical Trial Registration httpsregisterclinicaltrialsgovprsappactionSelectProtocolsidS0009RA3selectactionEdituidU0003F4Lts2cxajpsbw, identifier NCT04346602,We present results from clinical, radiologic, gas exchange, lung mechanics, and fibreoptic bronchoscopyguided transbronchial biopsies in a case of acute respiratory failure due to SARSCoV2 Covid19 This report highlights the pulmonary, immunological, and inflammatory changes found during acute diffuse alveolar damage and the later organizing phase An early diffuse alveolar damage pattern with predominant epithelial involvement with active recruitment of T cells and monocytes was observed followed by a late organizing pattern with pneumocyte hyperplasia, inflammatory infiltration, prominent endotheliitis, and secondary germinal centers The patients deterioration paralleling the late immunopathological findings based the decision to administer intravenous corticosteroids, resulting in clinical, gasometric, and radiologic improvement We believe that realtime clinicopathological correlation, along with the description of the immunological processes at play, will contribute to the full clinical picture of Covid19 and might lead to a more rational approach in the precise timing of antiinflammatory, anticytokine, or steroid therapies,,The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has impacted millions of people worldwide This novel virus has a variety of presentations and complications Notably, patients with this infection have an associated coagulopathy, presenting with symptoms such as gastrointestinal bleeds, deep vein thrombosis, ischemic cerebrovascular events, and pulmonary embolism Although there are documented cases of venous thromboembolism in patients with coronavirus disease 2019, the authors present an interesting case of upper extremity arterial thromboembolism in a 75yearold patient surgically treated for arterial thrombus removal We also discuss diagnosis, medical management, and surgical approach to an upper extremity arterial thromboembolism in a patient with coronavirus disease 2019, to highlight the challenges of hypercoagulability in such patients,,The new strain of coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 SARSCoV2 emerged in 2019 and hence is often referred to as coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 This disease causes hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS, and is considered as the cause of a global pandemic Very limited reports in addition to ex vivo model systems are available to understand the mechanism of action of this virus, which can be used for testing of any drug efficacy against virus infectivity COVID19 induces tissue stem cell loss, resulting inhibition of epithelial repair followed by inflammatory fibrotic consequences Development of clinically relevant models is important to examine the impact of the COVID19 virus in tissue stem cells among different organs In this review, we discuss ex vivo experimental models available to study the effect of COVID19 on tissue stem cells,,BackgroundTo evaluate the diagnostic performance of chest CT in differentiating coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 and nonCOVID19 causes of groundglass opacities GGOResultsA total of 80 patients 49 males and 31 females, 4648  1609u2009years confirmed with COVID19 by RTPCR and who underwent chest CT scan within 2u2009weeks of symptoms, and 100 patients 55 males and 45 females, 4894  1897u2009years presented with GGO on chest CT were enrolled in the study Three radiologists reviewed all CT chest exams after removal of all identifying data from the images They expressed the result as positive or negative for COVID19 and recorded the other pulmonary CT features with mention of laterality, lobar affection, and distribution pattern The clinical data and laboratory findings were recorded Chest CT offered diagnostic accuracy ranging from 59 to 772 in differentiating COVID19 from nonCOVID19associated GGO with sensitivity from 7625 to 90 and specificity from 45 to 67 The specificity was lower when differentiating COVID19 from nonCOVID19 viral pneumonias 305611 and higher 531703 after exclusion of viral pneumonia from the nonCOVID19 group Patients with COVID19 were more likely to have lesions in lower lobes p  0005, peripheral distribution p  0001, isolated groundglass opacity p  0043, subpleural bands p  0048, reverse halo sign p  0005, and vascular thickening p  0013 but less likely to have pulmonary nodules p  0001, traction bronchiectasis p  0005, pleural effusion p  0001, and lymphadenopathy p  0001ConclusionsChest CT offered reasonable sensitivity when differentiating COVID19 from nonCOVID19associated GGO with low specificity when differentiating COVID19 from other viral pneumonias and moderate specificity when differentiating COVID19 from other causes of GGO,Abstract Cardiovascular CV manifestations of COVID19 infection carry significant morbidity and mortality Current risk prediction for CV complications in COVID19 is limited and existing approaches fail to account for the dynamic course of the disease Here, we develop and validate the COVIDHEART predictor, a novel continuouslyupdating risk prediction technology to forecast CV complications in hospitalized patients with COVID19 The risk predictor is trained and tested with retrospective registry data from 2178 patients to predict two outcomes cardiac arrest and imagingconfirmed thromboembolic events In repeating model validation many times, we show that it predicts cardiac arrest with an average median early warning time of 18 hours IQR 1320 hours and an AUROC of 092 95 CI 091092, and thromboembolic events with a median early warning time of 72 hours IQR 12204 hours and an AUROC of 070 95 CI 067073 The COVIDHEART predictor is anticipated to provide tangible clinical decision support in triaging patients and optimizing resource utilization, with its clinical utility potentially extending well beyond COVID19,ABSTRACT  Background Syncope is not a common manifestation of COVID19, but it may occur in this context and it can be the presenting symptom in some cases Although several mechanisms may explain the pathophysiology behind COVID19 related syncope, a valid relationship has not been established yet In this systematic review, we aimed to examine the current incidence of syncope in COVID19 patients and to explore different patterns observed in this setting   Methods A systematic review across PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge and SCOPUS was performed, according to PRISMA guidelines, in order to identify all relevant articles regarding both COVID19 and syncope   Results We identified 81 publications, of which 62 were excluded The cumulative incidence of syncope and presyncope across the selected studies was 71 2563584 patients Unspecified syncope was the most common type 762 of the reported episodes, followed by reflex syncope 181 of the cases Orthostatic hypotension was responsible for 36 of the cases and syncope of presumable cardiac cause accounted for 20 Arterial hypertension was present in 647 of the patients and either angiotensin receptor blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were used by 395 of hypertensive patients with syncope   Conclusion Syncope, although not considered a typical symptom of the COVID19 disease, can be associated with it, particularly in early stages Different types of syncope were seen in this context, each with different implications requiring distinct approaches A careful reevaluation of blood pressure whenever a patient develops COVID19 is suggested, including reassessment of antihypertensive therapy,,Importance Hypokalemia is a neglected common manifestation in COVID19 patients admitted in hospital though it has serious consequences Coronavirus may cause hypokalemia through disruptions of renninangiotensin system, gastrointestinal loss or other unknown mechanisms Objective To investigate the prevalence of hypokalemia among patients with moderate to severe COVID19 and its association with other clinical and laboratory parameters Design, Setting, and Participants This was cross sectional observational study conducted at Dhaka medical College Hospital of Bangladesh from June, 2020, to August 2020 Participants were included who were positive for rtPCR for COVID19 according to the national guideline The patients were classified as having severe hypokalemia plasma potassium 3 mmolL, hypokalemia plasma potassium 335 mmolL, and normokalemia plasma potassium 35

included The mean SD age of these 134 patients according to different potassium levels appear to be  68 283 years for severe hypokalemia , 51931168 years for hypokalemia and 5073147 years for normokalemia Among them, 46 patients were females 3432 and rest were males 6568 Within the total sum of 134 patients, 107 were identified having normokalemia, 799 25 patients 18 7 had hypokalemia and only two patients 15 were found having normokalemia Among 134 patients, three commonest symptoms were fever 132 patients 985, dry cough 123 patients 9179 and shortness of breath 122 patients 9104, followed by less common symptoms like fatigue 89 patients 66410, sore throat 60 patients 4477, and diarrhea 44 patients, 3283 Shortness of breath was associated with grades of hypokalemia P0022 Only 26 patients 194 manifested having vomitingNausea The predominant comorbidities found among these 134 participants were Hypertension 68 patients 642, Diabetes 54 patients 529, Ischemic heart disease 37 patients 381 and Asthma 27 patients 310 The prevalence of comorbidities was not associated with Hypokalemia Conclusions Prevalence of hypokalemia among patients with COVID19 is high 202 and appropriate treatment is highly required J Dhaka Medical College, Vol 29, No2, October, 2020, Page 131137,BackgroundTreating severe forms of the acute respiratory distress syndrome and cardiac failure, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ECMO has become an established therapeutic option Neonatal or pediatric patients receiving ECMO, and patients undergoing extracorporeal CO2 removal ECCO2R represent lowflow applications of the technology, requiring lower blood flow than conventional ECMO Centrifugal blood pumps as a core element of modern ECMO therapy present favorable operating characteristics in the high blood flow range 4xa0Lmin8xa0Lmin However, during lowflow applications in the range of 05xa0Lmin2xa0Lmin, adverse events such as increased hemolysis, platelet activation and bleeding complications are reported frequentlyMethodsIn this study, the hemolysis of the centrifugal pump DP3 is evaluated both in vitro and in silico, comparing the lowflow operation at 1xa0Lmin to the highflow operation at 4xa0LminResultsIncreased hemolysis occurs at lowflow, both in vitro and in silico The invitro experiments present a sixfold higher relative increased hemolysis at lowflow Compared to highflow operation, a more than 35fold increase in blood recirculation within the pump head can be observed in the lowflow range in silicoConclusionsThis study highlights the underappreciated hemolysis in centrifugal pumps within the lowflow range, ie during pediatric ECMO or ECCO2R treatment The invitro results of hemolysis and the insilico computational fluid dynamic simulations of flow paths within the pumps raise awareness about blood damage that occurs when using centrifugal pumps at lowflow operating points These findings underline the urgent need for a specific pump optimized for lowflow treatment Due to the inherent problems of available centrifugal pumps in the lowflow range, clinicians should use the current centrifugal pumps with caution, alternatively other pumping principles such as positive displacement pumps may be discussed in the future,COVID results in a variety of pathophysiology that causes cardiorespiratory and the need for ECMO These include hypoxic respiratory failure, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, multisystem inflammatory disease, and vascular thrombosis with pulmonary embolism A variety of cannulation strategies are required and the hyperinflammation and consequent coagulation abnormalities mandate new strategies to provide optimal ECMO support,The lungs are often involved in tumors and are affected in a wide variety of ways Lung cancer comprises one of the most common cancer entities and has been characterized by axa0vast expansion of treatment approaches in recent years Moreover, the lungs are axa0common metastatic site of multiple other cancer entities Various treatment modalities, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, checkpoint inhibitors, chimeric antigen receptor cell therapy, and radiotherapy approaches can cause pulmonary side effects Finally, many patients suffer from pulmonary comorbidities which may mutually impact the clinical course and prognosis of the cancer disease As examples, various aspects, such as pulmonary venoocclusive disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are discussed,Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children MISC or paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARSCoV2 PIMSTS is an emerging disease in children affected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 SARSCoV2 infection and thought to be an immunemediated postinfectious complication of SARSCoV2 The disease presentation is similar to Kawasaki disease but has certain distinguishing features The exact pathogenesis is still not clear but an aberrant immune response, antibodymediated vascular damage and virusmediated abnormal type I and III interferongamma response are thought to be responsible Most children who are previously healthy present after 24xa0weeks of SARSCoV2 infections with febrile illness of short duration with prominent gastrointestinal, cardiac and hematologic manifestations, progressing to vasoplegic shock, requiring vasopressor therapy Cardiovascular involvement is prominently marked by acute myocardial injurymyocarditis and the development of coronary artery aneurysms Laboratory markers of inflammation are elevated uniformly Most children require intensive care, and few need invasive ventilation The treatment mainly consists of antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory therapy like intravenous immunoglobulins and steroids The overall prognosis is good and reported mortality rates are 04,BACKGROUND Coronavirus Covid19 infection represents a serious medical condition, often associated with cardiovascular complications, pulmonary hypertension PH, and right ventricle dysfunction RVD The aim of this study is to show, by means of transthoracic echocardiography TTE, the presence of an increased estimated systolic pressure in the pulmonary artery esPAP and altered right ventricular global longitudinal strain RVGLS in patients without history of PH METHODS In a group of 91 patients, aged under 55 years, hospitalized for a moderate Covid19 infection, a thorough cardiologic and TTE examination were performed two months after discharge Their initial thorax computertomography TCT images and laboratory data were accessed from the electronic data base of the hospital RESULTS We observed an increased prevalence of PH 769 and RVD 1028, significantly correlated with the initial levels of the TCT score and inflammatory factors p ˂ 0001, but borderline changes were observed in more patients Multivariate regression analysis showed that these factors and RVGLS explain 895 of elevated esPAP CONCLUSIONS In COVID19 infection, PH and RVD are common complications, being encountered after the recovery even in moderate cases It appears to be a connection between their severity and the extent of the initial pulmonary injury and of the inflammatory response,Medication therapy management MTM, is a service model aimed at helping general health problems by preventing morbidity and mortality Hypertension is a noncommunicable disease which is a serious health problem which requires longterm therapy xa0This study aims to see the effect of MTM on clinical Outcomes and quality of life of patients in hypertensive patients This type of research is a quasi experimental one group with a pretestposttest design Analysis using paired sample ttest and Wilcoxon test with a significance used P 0,05 Respondents were 70 people, 67,1 were women The characteristics of the majority age are 5564 years with a percentage of 51,4, the majority of education level is high school with 42,8, noncivil servant jobs with a percentage of 45,7, the length of diagnosis is dominated by 110 years 77,1 and comorbidities diabetes mellitus occurred the most 10,0 The results

Medication Therapy Management MTM has a significant influence on improving the quality of life and clinical Outcomes of hypertensive patients The higher the quality of life of patients, blood pressure becomes more controlled,Otorhinolaryngologists, particularly dealing with airway cases, are subjected to highest risk of COVID 19 aerosolisation, self infection and transmission Moreover, airway cases, which mostly present as emergency, cannot be deferred Being a tertiary airway centre and having received a number of airway cases, most of them requiring prompt surgical intervention, our airway surgery and anaesthesiology team had to work in conjunction to adapt and readapt the practice over the past few months, striving to achieve effective airway surgery protocols, to minimize exposure and prevent transmission of COVID 19 To enlist the encountered airway cases during COVID 19 pandemic and to highlight the important inclusions and adaptations in executing the airway surgeries A retrospective observational study of 7xa0months duration was carried out This is a single institutional study, where the sample included the primary as well the referred airway cases Apart from Tracheotomy, Foreign body bronchus removal, Dilatation of Laryngotracheal Stenosis LTS and excision of Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis RRP, we also have had the experience to deal with congenital Laryngotracheooesophageal Cleft LTOC Type III b, Thyroid surgery to relieve tracheal compression and Bilateral Choanal Atresia repair during the last 7xa0months Routine 2xa0weeks follow up of the patients have been favourable, as there has not been any report or clinical features of transmission of COVID 19 As the airway surgeries could be executed with the incorporation of certain change in practice and as the follow up revealed no evidence of transmission, we attempt to contribute to airway best practice guideline for maintaining the safety of patients and health professionals,PURPOSE OF REVIEW In December 2019, a novel respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 was first described and named coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 Although the knowledge base surrounding COVID19 and SARSCoV2 has grown rapidly, significant gaps in our knowledge remain and inaccurate information continues to circulate This review will discuss the interaction between asthma and COVID19 to provide a comprehensive understanding based on the currently available published data RECENT FINDINGS NonSARS human coronaviruses HCoVs are a significant cause of asthma exacerbations, but SARSCoV2 does not appear to exacerbate asthma Data thus far strongly suggest that patients with asthma are at no increased risk of infection with SARSCoV2 or more severe disease if infected with COVID19 Although the data are extremely limited on inhaled corticosteroids and biologic medications, there remain no data suggesting that these therapeutics positively or negatively impact the severity or outcome of COVID19 SUMMARY Data are rapidly evolving regarding COVID19 and asthma At this time, asthma does not appear to positively or negatively affect outcomes of COVID19 however, it is imperative that practitioners keep abreast of the changing literature as we await a vaccine and control of this pandemic,Increased risk of cardiovascular complications during and postCOVID19 infection is more and more recognizedincluding myocarditis, arrhythmias, and myocardial infarctions MIs The mechanisms leading to these complications are direct virusinduced injuries, as well as potential thrombotic and inflammatoryinduced mechanisms To the latter, inflammatory plaque instability and plaque rupture are discussed entities contributing to MIinduced postCOVID19 complications Our case report describes the first time, when a temporary impairment of LVEF in the COVID19convalescence phase unmasks a silent MI due to coronary plaque rupture by using invasive OCT and noninvasive CMR modalities Myocardial infarction might be an important differential diagnosis to consider in deteriorating patients with COVID19, especially if dyspnoea persists after acute infection,Pulmonary fibrosis PF is a chronic and progressively fatal disease, but clinically available therapeutic drugs are limited due to efficacy and side effects The possible mechanism of pulmonary fibrosis includes the damage of alveolar epithelial cells II AEC2, and activation of immune cells such as macrophages The ions released from bioceramics have shown the activity in stimulating soft tissue derived cells such as fibroblasts, endothelia cells and epithelia cells, and regulating macrophage polarization Therefore, this study proposes an ion therapy approach based on the active ions of bioceramic materials, and investigates the therapeutic effect of bioactive ions derived from calcium silicate CS bioceramics on mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis We demonstrate that silicate ions significantly reduce pulmonary fibrosis by simultaneously regulating the functions of AEC2 and macrophages This result suggests potential clinical applications of ion therapy for lung fibrosis,The incidence of heart failure HF remains high and patients with HF are at risk for frequent hospitalisations Remote monitoring technologies may provide early indications of HF decompensation and potentially allow for optimisation of therapy to prevent HF hospitalisations The need for reliable remote monitoring technology has never been greater as the COVID19 pandemic has led to the rapid expansion of a new mode of healthcare delivery the virtual visit With the convergence of remote monitoring technologies and reliable method of remote healthcare delivery, an understanding of the role of both in the management of patients with HF is critical In this review, we outline the evidence on current remote monitoring technologies in patients with HF and highlight how these advances may benefit patients in the context of the current pandemic,STUDY OBJECTIVES By modifying the apneic threshold, the antiplatelet agent ticagrelor could promote central sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome CSAHS We aimed to assess the association between CSAHS and ticagrelor administration METHODS Patients were prospectively included within 1 year after acute coronary syndrome ACS, if they had no heart failure and left ventricular ejection fractionxa0xa045 and no history of sleep apnea After an overnight sleep study, patients were classified as normal with apnea hypopnea index AHI,Purpose Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 presents with a spectrum of disease severity, the most serious cases requiring intensive care Echocardiography is a frontline tool in evaluating cardiovascular complications of COVID19 in the intensive care unit ICU we analyzed transthoracic echocardiograms obtained from this patient population with stateoftheart ultrasound technology Methods All patients with COVID19 requiring ICU admission on whom a transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained were included in the study Focused transthoracic protocols were performed by experienced sonographers Echocardiographic variables, including speckletracking echocardiography, were collected and analyzed Clinical information was obtained from the electronic medical record Patients were followed until discharge Results Of 52 total patients mean age 599  116 years, 596 were male and 15 29 had known prior cardiac disease Cardiac complications identified on echocardiography were prevalent, occurring in 557 of patients Patients with known prior cardiac disease were more likely to have new or worsening left ventricular dysfunction Right ventricular dysfunction was the most common abnormality assessed qualitatively in 18 cases and with advanced echocardiographic methods in 34 cases Known prior cardiac disease, right ventricular enlargement, and pulmonary hypertension were significantly associated with morbidity and mortality Conclusions Patients requiring intensive care for COVID19 face significant morbidity and mortality, and cardiac complications occur in the majority of patients admitted to the ICU with COVID19 Those with known prior cardiac disease fare worse, and other echocardiographic findings right ventricular enlargement, pulmonary hypertension are also associated with worse outcomes Stateoftheart echocardiography performed by experienced sonographers can be critical to identifying cardiac complications and guiding ICU strategy,,,The year 2020 has been plagued by the COVID‑19 pandemic that has resulted in an additional 1,800,000 deaths worldwide Many patients who recover from Covid19 later present with shortness of breath and fibrosis of the lungs, while some take a long time to recover from the initial infection A drug such as pirfenidone, which has been used for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, could offer additional benefits by reverting pulmonary fibrotic damage Here we describe a case series of five patients where addition of this drug showed marked improvement in symptoms and radiological findings Apart from the efforts regarding understanding the pathophysiology of this new disease, we must also evaluate the proportion of patients that develop chronic lung disease due to fibrosis following COVID19 recovery Certainly, more attention should be given to new studies to determine the actual benefit of pirfenidone in patients with pulmonary fibrosis as a result of Covid19 infection,Bergamo province was badly hit by the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 epidemic We organised a publicfunded, multidisciplinary followup programme for COVID19 patients discharged from the emergency department or from the inpatient wards of Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, the largest public hospital in the area As of 31 July, the first 767 patients had completed the first postdischarge multidisciplinary assessment Patients entered our programme at a median time of 81 days after discharge Among them, 514 still complained of symptoms, most commonly fatigue and exertional dyspnoea, and 305 were still experiencing posttraumatic psychological consequences Impaired lung diffusion was found in 19 Seventeen per cent had Ddimer values two times above the threshold for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism two unexpected and clinically silent pulmonary thrombosis were discovered by investigating striking Ddimer elevation Survivors of COVID19 exhibit a complex array of symptoms, whose common underlying pathology, if any, has still to be elucidated a multidisciplinary approach is fundamental, to address the different problems and to look for effective solutions,,Cardiovascular involvement is one of the endorgan complications commonly reported in coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 It has also been postulated to be an independent risk factor for increased mortality in COVID19infected patients With such a significant effect of COVID19 on the cardiovascular system and vice versa, it is pivotal for physicians to observe this association closely for improving management and understanding prognosis in these patients Here, we present three patients and describe their baseline cardiac risk factors, the cardiac complications they developed in association with COVID19 infection, and their varying outcomes,PURPOSE OF REVIEW Asthma patients are typically at increased risk for severe outcomes from viral respiratory infections However, asthma and atopy do not appear to be overrepresented comorbidities in COVID19 patients, and hypotheses attempt to explain this observation As COVID19 continues to spread globally, it is imperative to understand how disease outcomes may be influenced in this population to guide patient care RECENT FINDINGS Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ACE2 is the principal host cell receptor for SARSCoV2 entry and Transmembrane Protease Serine 2 TMRSS2 is the main priming protease Models have linked atopic endotypes to reductions in ACE2 and increases in TMRSS2 on respiratory epithelia Epidemiologic and experimental findings imply alterations in ACE2 expression correlate with clinical COVID19 disease, but limitations restrict the ability to draw direct conclusions SUMMARY There is reasonable evidence to assert atopic endotypes modulate COVID19 susceptibility, but it remains premature to classify this association as protective or deleterious Asthma is a heterogeneous disease and epidemiologic studies should focus on investigating COVID19 outcomes by underlying endotype Direct experimental and clinical evidence is needed to draw definitive conclusions on how the complex interplay of ACE2 and TMRSS2 affect viral entry VIDEO ABSTRACT httpswwwdropboxcomsh9sfwqhz2h78sio3AAB0JYd4MFzM5JjDFcYwz4CXadl0,BACKGROUND Little is known about the role of ECG markers of increased risk of sudden cardiac death during the acute period of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID19 pneumonia OBJECTIVES To evaluate ECG markers of sudden cardiac death on admission, including the index of cardiac electrophysiological balance iCEB QTcQRS and transmural dispersion of repolarization TDR T from peak to end Tpe interval and TpeQTc, in patients with COVID19 pneumonia PATIENTS AND METHODS This crosssectional study included 63 patients with newly diagnosed COVID19 pneumonia who presented to the outpatient clinic or admitted to the respiratory care unit between August 20 and September 15, 2020 Fortysix persons matched for sex and age were selected from data collected before COVID19 pandemic RESULTS QRS and QTc showed a significant prolongation in patients with COVID19 pneumonia compared to the controls 87 vs 78, p,Emerging cases of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2xa0SARSCOV2 have been associated with a variety of disorders including respiratory failure, immune reactive syndrome, multiorgan failure, and hypercoagulable statesxa0COVID19 induces a severe global inflammatory response which can result in endothelial damage leading to hypercoagulabilityxa0Most COVID19 cases of hypercoagulable states reported venous thrombosisxa0We report here a case of a 65yearold Hispanic male diagnosed with bilateral acute lower limb ischemia and renal infarcts secondary to a severe COVID19 infection,Critical patients with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 suffer from severe illness and have a high mortality rate Lung transplantation may be the final option for a subset of these patients Herein we report the important role of perioperative echocardiography in a COVID19 patient who underwent bilateral lung transplantation because of severe respiratory failure The precise evaluation provided by echocardiography enabled the prevention of anastomotic complications and the successful management of haemodynamic instability Echocardiographers should be familiar with the complications of lung transplantation and the haemodynamics under extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support to achieve a more accurate interpretation of cardiac parameters,BackgroundMesenchymal stem cells MSCs have been used to treat asthma in a mouse model However, the efficacy and mechanism of MSCs are not elucidated MicroRNAs miRNAs play a key rolein asthma and related to the aim of thisxa0study was to illustrate the role of miR21 and its influence on MSC migration in asthma model MethodsA mouse model of asthma was established using cockroach extract CRE, and miR21 expression was examined A miR21 lentivirus construct was used to investigate the role of miR21 in vivo and in vitro in mouse bone marrowderived BM MSCs A TOPFlash reporter gene assay was used to study the signaling downstream of miR21 IL4, IL5, IL13, IgE, and IgG1 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids were determined by enzymelinked immunosorbent assaysResultsMiR21 was upregulated in CREinduced asthmatic mice MiR21 promoted allergic airway inflammation and airway hyperreactivity by inhibiting BMMSC migration βCatenin was found to act downstream of miR21 as a negative regulator of miR21 Rescue experiments verified that miR21 inhibited BMMSC migration by suppressing Wntβcatenin signalingConclusionMiR21 promotes allergic airway inflammation and AHR and inhibits BMMSC migration through Wntβcatenin signaling, which may serve as an effective therapeutic target for asthma,Pulmonary arterial hypertension PAH is axa0progressive and lifethreatening disease even in childhood Currently approved treatment options for children include the endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan and the phosphodiesterase‑5 inhibitor sildenafil however, treatment of PAH has made significant progress over the past decade and new substances  of targeted drug therapies, such as riociguat or selexipag are currently being evaluated for their efficacy and safety in children Due to the different etiologies, such as PAH in children with congenital heart defects CHD, treatment strategies may differ compared to adults Therapeutic drug monitoring can be useful in pediatric patients There is axa0clear need for controlled trials of PAH drugs alone or in combination therapy in the pediatric age group to limit offlabel use As part of the transition of pediatric patients into adulthood, the responsible pediatric cardiologists play axa0special role In the transition phase topics, such as information on heart defects, treatment, special features of hemodynamics, endocarditis prophylaxis, sexuality, reproduction and contraception, sport and work ability as well as cardiovascular risk factors are of particular importance Also in adulthood, patients should be treated by the respective specialists based on the etiology of the PAH In particular, cardiologists with an additional qualification for the care of grownup congenital heart disease GUCH have special knowledge in the treatment of patients with congenital heart defects and PAH,Phosgene carbonyl dichloride gas is an indispensable highproductionvolume chemical intermediate used worldwide in numerous industrial processes Published evidence of human exposures due to accidents and warfare World War I has been reported however, these reports often lack specificity because of the uncharacterized exposure intensities of phosgene andor related irritants These may include liquid or solid congeners of phosgene, including di and triphosgene andor the respiratory tract irritant chlorine which are often collectively reported under the umbrella of phosgene exposure without any appreciation of their differences in causing acute lung injury ALI Among these irritants, phosgene gas is somewhat unique because of its poor water solubility This prevents any appreciable retention of the gas in the upper airways and related trigeminal sensations of irritation By contrast, in the pulmonary compartment, amphiphilic surfactant might scavenge this lipophilic gas The interaction of phosgene and the surfactant may affect basic physiological functions controlled by Starlings and Laplaces laws, which can be followed by cardiogenic pulmonary edema The phenotypic manifestations are dependent on the concentrationu202f×u202fexposure duration Cu202f×u202ft the higher the Cu202f×u202ft is, the less time that is required for edema to appear It is hypothesized that this type of edema is caused by cardiovascular and colloid osmotic imbalances to initial neurogenic events but not because of the injury itself Thus, hemodynamic etiologies appear to cause imbalances in extravasated fluids and solute accumulation in the pulmonary interstitium, which is not drained away by the lymphatic channels of the lung The most salient associated findings are hemoconcentration and hypoproteinemia The involved intertwined pathophysiological processes coordinating pulmonary ventilation and cardiopulmonary perfusion under such conditions are complex Pulmonary arterial catheter measurements on phosgeneexposed dogs provided evidence of cor pulmonale, a form of acute right heart failure produced by a sudden increase in resistance to blood flow in the pulmonary circulation about 20 h postexposure The objective of this review is to critically analyze evidence from experimental inhalation studies in rats and dogs, and evidence from accidental human exposures to better understand the primary and secondary events causing cardiopulmonary dysfunction and an ensuing lifethreatening lung edema Mechanismbased diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are also considered for this form of cardiogenic edema,BackgroundIt is necessary to analyze the CT pulmonary vascular parameters and disease severity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD patients to provide evidence support for the management of COPDMethodsCOPD patients on acute exacerbation admitted to our hospital from COPD patients from January 2019 to March 2020 was selected The characteristics and ratio of the crosssectional area CSA of small pulmonary vessels to the total area of the lung field, and the ratio of pulmonary artery and aorta PAA crosssectional diameter in patients with COPD were analyzedResultsA total of 128 COPD patients were included There were significant differences in the duration of COPD, smoking history, the PaO2, PaCO2, pH, and FEV1, FVC and FEV1FVC among COPD patients with different severity all p,The coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic has become a global threat Increases in cardiac biomarkers are common and are associated with adverse outcomes in patients with COVID19 Although these increases are more likely to occur in cases with concomitant cardiac disease, the differences in cardiac biomarker levels between patients with and without cardiac disease and their associations with inhospital mortality are largely unknown A consecutive serial of laboratoryconfirmed COVID19 cases was retrospectively enrolled Clinical characteristics, laboratory results, and outcome data were collected The levels of cardiac biomarkers were evaluated and compared by stratifying patients according to concomitant cardiac conditions and clinical classifications The prognostic efficacy of cardiac biomarker levels on admission was also assessed Among the overall study population and survived patients, the cardiac biomarker levels at both the early and late stages in cardiac patients were significantly higher than those in noncardiac patients However, their concentrations in cardiac patients were comparable to noncardiac ones among nonsurvivors The cardiac biomarker levels at the late stage of the disease were significantly decreased compared to those at the early stage among patients who were alive Whereas, the latestage biomarker levels were significantly increased in patients who ultimately died Subgroup analysis illustrated that increases in cardiac biomarkers were closely related to the severity of the disease, and were prognostic for high risks of inhospital mortality in noncardiac, rather than in cardiac patients Myo and NTproBNP, rather than HsTnI and CKMB, were independently associated with inhospital mortality in the overall population and noncardiac patients However, these associations were not significant among cardiac patients In conclusion, our results helped better understand the release pattern and prognostic performance of cardiac biomarkers in patients with COVID19 Increased levels of Myo and NTproBNP on admission could be useful markers for early identifying highrisk patients However, special attention must be paid when implementing the prognostic function for cardiac patients,Background Given the high prevalence of heart failure HF in the elderly, it is essential to establish medical coordination between general practitioners GPs and acute care hospitals ACHs in an aging society The aim of this study was to elucidate the status of acceptance of elderly patients with HF and their management requirements in a comprehensive community health system Furthermore, we investigated GPs interest in using information and communications technology ICT in patient care Methodsu2004andu2004Results We sent a questionnaire survey to 1,800 GPs in January 2015 and received 392 replies The overall prevalence of home visits was 55, with no differences according to GP background characteristics or geographic area However, less than half 44 reported accepting patients with symptomatic HF for treatment in their clinic In addition, only 3 GPs reported accepting and providing emergency visits for patients with refractory HF In particular, GPs who were not certificated cardiologists, female, and older showed poorer acceptance of symptomatic HF patients More than half the GPs wanted the prompt acceptance by ACHs of emergency patients, followed by strengthening of home care support at discharge and support for endoflife care Half the GPs were interested in telemedicine Conclusions ACHs must promptly accept patients with HF in cases of emergency and strengthen nursing care support at discharge It is also necessary to consider how to support older and female GPs,As the COVID19 pandemic aggravated the excessive workload of doctors globally, the demand for computer aided methods in medical imaging analysis increased even further Such tools can result in more robust diagnostic pipelines which are less prone to human errors In our paper, we present a deep neural network to which we refer to as Attention BCDUNet, and apply it to the task of lung and heart segmentation from chest Xray CXR images, a basic but ardous step in the diagnostic pipeline, for instance for the detection of cardiomegaly We show that the finetuned model exceeds previous stateoftheart results, reaching 981pm 01 Dice score and 952pm 01 IoU score on the dataset of Japanese Society of Radiological Technology JSRT Besides that, we demonstrate the relative simplicity of the task by attaining surprisingly strong results with training sets of size 10 and 20 in terms of Dice score, 970pm 08 and 973pm 05, respectively, while in terms of IoU score, 922pm 12 and 933pm 04, respectively To achieve these scores, we capitalize on the mixup augmentation technique, which yields a remarkable gain above 4 IoU score in the size 10 setup,BACKGROUND Due to the complexity and chronicity of heart failure, engaging yet simple patient selfmanagement tools are needed OBJECTIVE This study aimed to assess the feasibility and patient engagement with a smartphone app designed for heart failure METHODS Patients with heart failure were randomized to intervention smartphone with the Habits Heart App installed and Bluetoothlinked scale or control paper education material groups All intervention group patients were interviewed and monitored closely for app feasibility while receiving standard of care heart failure management by cardiologists The Atlanta Heart Failure Knowledge Test, a quality of life survey Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, and weight were assessed at baseline and final visits RESULTS Patients N28 patients intervention n15 control n13 with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction 1528, 54 male 2028, 71, female 828, 29 median age 63 years were enrolled, and 82 of patients N23 intervention 1215, 80 control 1113, 85 completed both baseline and final visits median follow up 60 days In the intervention group, 2 out of the 12 patients who completed the study did not use the app after study onboarding due to illnesses and hospitalizations Of the remaining 10 patients who used the app, 5 patients logged 1 interaction with the app per day on average, and 2 patients logged an interaction with the app every other day on average The intervention group averaged 403 screen views per patient in 56 distinct sessions, 5minute session durations, and 22 weight entries per patient There was a direct correlation between duration of app use and improvement in heart failure knowledge Atlanta Heart Failure Knowledge Test score ρ059, P04 and quality of life Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score ρ063, P03 The correlation between app use and weight change was ρ040 P19 Only 1 out of 11 patients in the control group retained education material by the followup visit CONCLUSIONS The Habits Heart App with a Bluetoothlinked scale is a feasible way to engage patients in heart failure management, and barriers to app engagement were identified A larger multicenter study may be warranted to evaluate the effectiveness of the app TRIAL REGISTRATION ClinicalTrialsgov NCT03238729

such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD, asthma and pulmonary fibrosis Rhoassociated coiledcoilforming protein kinase ROCK consists as two isoforms, ROCK1 and ROCK2, and both are playing critical roles in many cellular responses to injury In this study, we aimed to elucidate the differential role of ROCK isoforms on TGFβ signaling in lung fibrosis and repair For this purpose, we tested the effect of a nonselective ROCK 1 and 2 inhibitor compound 31 and a selective ROCK2 inhibitor compound A11 in inhibiting TGFβinduced remodeling in lung fibroblasts and slices and dysfunctional epithelialprogenitor interactions in lung organoids Here, we demonstrated that the inhibition of ROCK12 with compound 31 represses TGFβdriven actin remodeling as well as extracellular matrix deposition in lung fibroblasts and PCLS, whereas selective ROCK2 inhibition with compound A11 did not Furthermore, the TGFβ induced inhibition of organoid formation was functionally restored in a concentrationdependent manner by both dual ROCK 1 and 2 inhibition and selective ROCK2 inhibition We conclude that dual pharmacological inhibition of ROCK 1 and 2 counteracts TGFβ induced effects on remodeling and alveolar epithelial progenitor function, suggesting this to be a promising therapeutic approach for respiratory diseases associated with fibrosis and defective lung repair,BACKGROUND Uncontrolled or undiagnosed hypertension HTN is estimated to be as high as 46 in emergency departments EDs Uncontrolled HTN contributes significantly to cardiovascular morbidity and disproportionately affects communities of color EDs serve high risk populations with uncontrolled conditions that are often missed by other clinical settings and effective interventions for uncontrolled HTN in the ED are critically needed The ED is well situated to decrease the disparities in HTN control by providing a streamlined intervention to high risk populations that may use the ED as their primary care METHODS Targeting of UnControlled Hypertension in the Emergency Department TOUCHED, is a twoarm single site randomized controlled trial of 770 adults aged 1875 presenting to the ED with uncontrolled HTN comparing 1 usual care, versus 2 an Educational and Empowerment E2 intervention that integrates a PostAcute Care Hypertension Consultation PACHTc with a mobile health BP selfmonitoring kit The primary outcome is differences in mean systolic blood pressure SBP at 6months post enrollment Secondary outcomes include differences in mean SBP and mean diastolic BP DBP at 3months and mean DBP at 6months Additionally, improvement in cardiovascular risk score, medication adherence, primary care engagement, and HTN knowledge will also be assessed as part of this study CONCLUSIONS The TOUCHED

2019 COVID19 is spreading rapidly throughout the world Lung is the primary organ which the COVID19 virus affects and leads to pneumonia, an acute respiratory distress syndrome COVID19 infects the lower respiratory system, and the lungs response to this infection is recruiting macrophages and monocytes leading to inflammation, this response causes widespread damage to the lungs airways   Aim The purpose of this study is to review studies of using lowdose radiation as a treatment for the inflammation of the tissue and pneumonia resulting from COVID19 These studies were compared with the risk of developing lung cancer during performed dose for the treatment of COVID19 in radiation therapy   Materials and methods Our study focused on in vitro, in vivo and clinical reports of using lowdose radiation for the treatment of inflammation, pneumonia and COVID19 The risk of lung cancer resulting from suggested dose in these studies was also evaluated   Conclusion From the review of articles, we have found that lowdose radiation can lead to improvement in inflammation in different line cells and animals in addition, it has been effective in treating inflammation and pneumonia caused by COVID19 in human up to 80 Since suggested doses do not remarkably increase the lung cancer risk, lowdose radiation can be an adjuvant treatment for COVID19 patients,Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 has a high mortality in elderly patients with preexisting cardiovascular diseases The cellular receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 is the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2, thereby implicating a link between cardiovascular diseases and SARSCoV2 susceptibility Aortic stenosis AS represents a chronic inflammatory state with severe cardiovascular complications in the elderly, a prime condition for COVID19 mortality The circulating ACE2 levels were measured in 111 patients with severe AS and compared to patients with hypertension and healthy individuals About 4 times higher circulating ACE2 activity was found in patients with severe AS than in hypertensives or healthy individuals 883u2009u2009616, nu2009u2009111, 206u2009u2009134, nu2009u2009540, and 161u2009u200974xa0mUL, nu2009u200946, respectively Patients with severe AS were older than patients with hypertension 80u2009u20096xa0years vs 60u2009u200915xa0years, P,Acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS represents an acute diffuse inflammation of the lungs triggered by different causes, uniformly leading to a noncardiogenic pulmonary edema with inhomogeneous densities in lung Xray and lung CT scan and acute hypoxemia Edema formation results in heavy lungs, inducing loss of compliance and the need to spend more energy to move the lungs Consequently, an ARDS patient, as long as the patient is breathing spontaneously, has an increased respiratory drive to ensure adequate oxygenation and CO2 removal One would expect that, once the blood gases get back to physiological values, the respiratory drive would normalize and the breathing effort return to its initial status However, in many ARDS patients, this is not the case their respiratory drive appears to be upregulated and fully or at least partially detached from the blood gas status Strikingly, similar alteration of the respiratory drive can be seen in patients suffering from SARS, especially SARSCovid19 We hypothesize that alterations of the reninangiotensinsystem RAS related to the pathophysiology of ARDS and SARS are involved in this dysregulation of chemosensitive control of breathing,,,,,BackgroundOne of the most severe complications of the current COVID19 pandemic is acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS ARDS is caused by increased amounts of proinflammatory cytokines, leading to lung damage and loss of lung function There are currently no effective therapies for combatting ARDS Mesenchymal stem cells MSCs have been suggested as a potential treatment for ARDS due to their significant immunomodulatory properties MSC small extracellular vesicles sEVs, including exosomes, modulate the immune response as effectively as MSCs themselves, with the added advantages of increased safety and tissue penetrationMethodsWe isolated sEVsxa0from MSCs induced to secrete increased levels of neurotrophic and immunomodulatory factors, termed Exo MSCNTF, and compared their ability to treat ARDS, in a lung injury LPS mouse model, to sEVs isolated from naïve MSCs Exo MSC Measurments of lung histopathological changes and neutrophil infiltration, blood oxygen saturation, and bronchoalveolar lavge fluid BALF proinflammatory cytokines and coagulation related factors were performedResultsWe found that Exo MSCNTF was superior to Exo MSC in reducing LPSinduced ARDS markers, including physiological lung damage such as alveolar wall thickness, fibrin presence, and neutrophil accumulation, as well as increasing oxygenation levels Furthermore, Exo MSCNTF reversed the imbalance in the host immune response, seen as decreased IFNγ, IL6, TNFα, and RANTES levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluidConclusionsThese positive preclinical results suggest that Exo MSCNTF may be suitable as a therapy for COVID19induced ARDS and are more effective at combatting ARDS physiological, pathological, and biochemical symptoms than sEVs isolated from noninduced MSCs,,AIMS Azithromycin is widely used broad spectrum antibiotic recently used in treatment protocol of COVID19 for its antiviral and immunomodulatory effects combined with Hydroxychloroquine or alone Rat models showed that Azithromycin produces oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis of myocardial tissue Rosuvastatin, a synthetic statin, can attenuate myocardial ischemia with antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects This study aims to evaluate the probable protective effect of Rosuvastatin against Azithromycin induced cardiotoxicity MAIN METHOD Twenty adult male albino rats were divided randomly into four groups, five rats each control, Azithromycin, Rosuvastatin, and Azithromycin Rosuvastatin groups Azithromycin 30xa0mgkgday and Rosuvastatin 2xa0mgkgday were administrated for two weeks by an intragastric tube Twentyfour hours after the last dose, rats were anesthetized and the following measures were carried out Electrocardiogram, Blood samples for Biochemical analysis of lactate dehydrogenase LDH, and creatine phosphokinase CPK The animals sacrificed, hearts excised, apical part processed for HE, immunohistochemical staining, and examined by light microscope The remaining parts of the heart were collected for assessment of Malondialdehyde MDA and Reduced Glutathione GSH KEY FINDINGS The results revealed that Rosuvastatin significantly ameliorates ECG changes, biochemical, and Oxidative stress markers alterations of Azithromycin Histological evaluation from Azithromycin group showed marked areas of degeneration, myofibers disorganization, inflammatory infiltrate, and hemorrhage Immunohistochemical evaluation showed significant increase in both Caspase 3 and Tumor necrosis factor TNF immune stain Rosuvastatin treated group showed restoration of the cardiac muscle fibers in HE and Immunohistochemical results SIGNIFICANCE We concluded that Rosuvastatin significantly ameliorates the toxic changes of Azithromycin on the heart,Highlights    •

11, respectively Human leukocyte antigen antibody reactivity was the highest cause of product loss for CCP donations vs SA donations 96 vs 13 Acute adverse events also occurred at a higher rate among both firsttime and repeat CCP donations compared to SA CONCLUSIONS CCP donors were more likely to be firsttime and female donors than WB or SA donors CCP donations had a higher rate of donor adverse reactions, deferrals, and product loss than SA donations,Antihypertensive therapy, particularly with the use of an angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor, improves outcomes in patients with hypertension and SARSCoV2 infection, who are susceptible to hyperinflammation and severe outcomes with COVID19,The role of 25OHvitamin D in the assessment of coronavirus disease 19 COVID19 has not been investigated We sought to investigate the prevalence of 25OHvitamin D deficiency among COVID19 patients, and to determine the associations between 25OHvitamin D status and the severity of the disease We have conducted a retrospective observational study of COVID19 patients admitted to the University of Verona Hospital Trust Demographic, clinical and biochemical parameters were collected at hospital admission, and serum 25OHvitamin D levels were measured The following outcomes were assessed arterial partial oxygen pressure PaO2 Creactive protein CRP length of hospitalization requirement

arterial PaO2 60 mmHg had significantly lower mean 25OHvitamin D levels compared to patients with PaO2 60 mmHg 133 ngmL vs 204 ngmL respectively, p003 Vitamin D deficiency was associated with 3fold higher risk of having arterial pO2 60 mmHg 25OHvitamin D deficiency was associated with increased CRP and dyspnea 25OHvitamin D deficiency was associated with more severe systemic inflammatory response and respiratory failure in COVID19 patients,BACKGROUND Assessment of visualcoronary artery calcification on noncardiac gated CT in COVID19 patients could provide an objective approach to rapidly identify and triage clinically severe patients for early hospital admission to avert worse prognosis PURPOSE To ascertain the role of semiquantitative scoring in visualcoronary artery calcification score VCACS for predicting the clinical severity and outcome in patients with COVID19 MATERIALS AND METHODS With institutional review board approval this study included 67 COVID19 confirmed patients who underwent noncardiac gated CT chest in an inpatient setting Two blinded radiologist Radiologist1 2 assessed the VCACS, CT Chest severity score CTSS The clinical data including the requirement for oxygen support, assisted ventilation, ICU admission and outcome was assessed, and patients were clinically subdivided depending on clinical severity Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent predictors ROC curves analysis is performed for the assessment of performance and Pearson correlation were performed to looks for the associations RESULTS VCACS cut off value of 3 8267 sensitivity and 5455 specificity AUC 075 and CTSS with a cut off value of 215 957 sensitivity and 636 specificity AUC 087 are independent predictors for clinical severity and also the need for ICU admission or assisted ventilation The pooling of both CTSS and VCACS 8267 sensitivity and 864 specificity AUC 092 are more reliable in terms of predicting the primary outcome of COVID19 patients On regression analysis, VCACS and CTSS are individual independent predictors of clinical severity in COVID19 Odds ratio, 172 95 CI, 099298 pxa0xa0005 and Odds ratio, 122 95 CI, 108139 pxa0xa00001 respectively The area under the curve AUC for pooled VCACS and CTSS was 096 95 CI 084098 which correctly predicted 821 cases CONCLUSION Logistic regression model using pooled VisualCoronary artery calcification score and CT Chest severity score in noncardiac gated CT can predict clinical severity and outcome in patients with COVID19,ObjectivesBasic and clinical studies have shown that magnesium sulphate ameliorates lung injury and controls asthma attacks by antiinflammatory and bronchodilatory effects Both intravenous and inhaled magnesium sulphate have a clinical impact on acute severe asthma by inhibition of airway smooth muscle contraction Besides, magnesium sulphate can dilate constricted pulmonary arteries and reduce pulmonary artery resistance However, it may affect systemic arteries when administered intravenously A large number of patients with covid19 admitted to the hospital suffer from pulmonary involvement COVID19 can cause hypoxia due to the involvement of the respiratory airways and parenchyma along with circulatory impairment, which induce ventilationperfusion mismatch This condition may result in hypoxemia and low arterial blood oxygen pressure and saturation presented with some degree of dyspnoea and shortness of breath Inhaled magnesium sulphate as a smooth muscle relaxant natural calcium antagonist can cause both bronchodilator and consequently vasodilator effects via a direct effect on alveolar arterioles in wellventilated areas in the respiratory tract We aim to investigate if inhaled magnesium sulphate as adjuvant therapy to standard treatment can reduce ventilationperfusion mismatch in the respiratory tract and subsequently improve arterial oxygen saturation in hospitalized patients with COVID19Trial designA

of the key elements of the full protocol,The COVID19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on cardiology training Novel opportunities have been identified in several domains patient exposure, procedural experience, didactic education, research and development, advocacy and wellbeing, and career advancement Lessons learned from COVID19 should be used to further improve fellowship training such as, for example, through the development of a competencybased training and evaluation system Multimodality teaching that incorporates telelearning provides creative solutions for trainee and continuing medical education Fellowinitiated research should be supported and nurtured Enhanced attention to trainee wellbeing and burnout is particularly important The emerging cardiologists of the future and the way they are trained will be shaped by the COVID19 challenge of our generation,Background This study aimed to explore the predictive value of a clinical biochemistrybased nomogram in COVID19 Methods The plasma or serum concentrationslevels of carcinoembryonic antigen CEA and other biomarkers, eg, Creactive protein CRP, white blood cell WBC, interleukin6 IL6, ferritin Fer, procalcitonin PCT, lymphocyte percentage L, Ddimer D2, and neutrophils percentage Neu, were assessed in 314 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID19 The area under the curve was used to estimate the diagnostic and prognostic value for COVID19 Cox and logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the independent prognostic risk factors for the survival of patients with COVID19 Results Receiver operating characteristic ROC curves were used to determine the area under the curve AUC values for CEA, IL6, CRP, PCT, Fer, Ddimer levels and L, Neu, and WBC to assess disease classification The critical values for these markers to predict severe disease type were then determined The hazard ratio of prognosis for risk of COVID19 identified CEA, WBC, CRP, PCT, Fer, Ddimer, Neu, and L as independent prognostic factors For the nomogram of overall survival OS, the Cindex was 084, demonstrating a good discriminative performance Conclusions An OS nomogram for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of COVID19 was constructed using biomarkers These data will be useful for the diagnosis, management, and therapy of COVID19,COVID19 has infected 774 million people worldwide and has caused 17 million fatalities as of December 21, 2020 The primary cause of death due to COVID19 is Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ARDS According to the World Health Organization WHO, people who are at least 60 years old or have comorbidities that have primarily been targeted are at the highest risk from SARSCoV2 Medical imaging provides a noninvasive, touchfree, and relatively safer alternative tool for diagnosis during the current ongoing pandemic Artificial intelligence AI scientists are developing several intelligent computeraided diagnosis CAD tools in multiple imaging modalities, ie, lung computed tomography CT, chest Xrays, and lung ultrasounds These AI tools assist the pulmonary and critical care clinicians through a faster detection of the presence of a virus, b classifying pneumonia types, and c measuring the severity of viral damage in COVID19infected patients Thus, it is of the utmost importance to fully understand the requirements of for a fast and successful, and timely lung scans analysis This narrative review first presents the pathological layout of the lungs in the COVID19 scenario, followed by understanding and then explains the comorbid statistical distributions in the ARDS framework The novelty of this review is the approach to classifying the AI models as per the by school of thought SoTs, exhibiting based on segregation of techniques and their characteristics The study also discusses the identification of AI models and its extension from nonARDS lungs preCOVID19 to ARDS lungs postCOVID19 Furthermore, it also presents AI workflow considerations of for medical imaging modalities in the COVID19 framework Finally, clinical AI design considerations will be discussed We conclude that the design of the current existing AI models can be improved by considering comorbidity as an independent factor Furthermore, ARDS postprocessing clinical systems must involve include i the clinical validation and verification of AImodels, ii reliability and stability criteria, and iii easily adaptable, and iv generalization assessments of AI systems for their use in pulmonary, critical care, and radiological settings,The study contains

Isolation Units of different health care institutes across Pakistan The collected ECG images data were manually reviewed by medical professors using Telehealth ECG diagnostic system, under the supervision of senior medical professionals with experience in ECG interpretation The manual reviewing process of ECG images took several months to review the five distinct categories COVID19, Abnormal Heartbeat, Myocardial Infarction MI, Previous History of MI, and Normal Person The collected data contains 12 leadsbased ECG images dataset can be used by Data Scientist, IT Professional and Medical Research Institutes to design, compare, finetune classical techniques and Deep learning methods in studies focused on COVID19, Arrhythmia, and other cardiovascular conditions The dataset contains rare categories of patients that may be used for the development of automatic diagnosis tool for healthcare institutes,The newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 causes several heterogeneous clinical conditions collectively known as Coronavirus disease19 COVID19 Older patients with significant cardiovascular conditions and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD are predisposed to a more severe disease complicated with acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS, which is associated with high morbidity and mortality COPD is associated with increased susceptibility to respiratory infections, and viruses are among the top causes of acute exacerbations of COPD AECOPD Thus, COVID19 could represent the ultimate cause of AECOPD This review will examine the pathobiological processes underlying SARSCoV2 infection, including the effects of cigarette smoke and COPD on the immune system and vascular endothelium, and the known effects of cigarette smoke on the onset and progression of COVID19 We will also review the epidemiological data on COVID19 prevalence and outcome in patients with COPD and analyze the pathobiological and clinical features of SARSCoV2 infection in the context of other known viral causes of AECOPD Overall, SARSCoV2 shares common pathobiological and clinical features with other viral agents responsible for increased morbidity, thus representing a novel cause of AECOPD with the potential for a more longterm adverse impact Longitudinal studies aimed at COPD patients surviving COVID19 are needed to identify therapeutic targets for SARSCoV2 and prevent the diseases burden in this vulnerable population,In this paper we present our experience on the treatment at home of Covid symptomatic patients One hundred and eightytwo subjects 111 men and 71 women aged from 32 to 71 years have been consecutively followed at home in telemedicine from 1st September to 24th December 2020 We were informed almost twice daily in morning and evening about body temperature, symptoms cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle of body aches, headache, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, oxygen saturation measured by digital pulse oximetry and blood pressure Our protocol of treatment was based on early use of prednisone 25 mg in the morning and 125 mg in the afternoon and low molecular weight heparin 4000 UI one or two times daily initiated just after the positivity of molecular nasopharyngeal test about 34 days as mean time after initiation of symptomatology and not after 78 days as suggested by other protocols and oxygen therapy when necessary Antibiotics such as azithromycin for six days was added It is always recommended to associate lansoprazole 30 mg to prevent gastric hemorrhages and potassium and magnesium supplements This treatment scheme was able to reduce the risk of hospitalization as only 4 patients needed to be admitted to the Hospital, and only two in subintensive department After negativeness of molecular nasopharyngeal test, patients were invited for a thoracic computerized tomography and laboratory evaluation of ddimer and other data of inflammation to show eventual lung interstitial involvement characteristic of COVID19,Objective In this study, we aimed to compare the severity and outcomes in hypertensive patients presenting with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 who were taking angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors ACEIsangiotensin receptor blockers ARBs and those who were on other antihypertensive drugs Methods This retrospective cohort study involved 182 hypertensive patients who presented with COVID19 infection The study population comprisedxa091 patients who were taking ACEIsARBs group A and 91 patients who were taking other antihypertensive drugs such as βblockers BBs, calcium channel blockers CCBs, or thiazides group B All patients were provided the same type of treatmentxa0for the management of COVID19 We recorded the data related to demographic and anthropometric variables as well as clinical symptoms during the treatment period Disease severity and hospital mortality were the primary study endpoints Results There was no significant difference in COVID19related outcomes between the groups except for the severity of lung infiltration on chest Xrays There were 37 411 patients having 50 lung infiltration in group A and 53 582 in group B pvalue 002 Severe disease was diagnosed in 37 407 patients in group A compared to 39 427 patients in group B pvalue 076 Inhospital mortality was noted in 17 187 patients in group A and 22 242 patients in group B pvalue 036 Conclusion Based on our results, we did not find any significant association between the use of ACEIsARBs and either the severity of COVID19 infection necessitating admission to ICU orxa0inhospital mortality,BACKGROUND The novel coronavirus SARSCoV2, responsible for the 20192020 global COVID19 pandemic, is a respiratory virus associated with the development of thromboembolic complications and respiratory failure in severe cases Increased risk of pulmonary embolism and thrombosis has been identified in COVID19 patients, alongside accompanying elevations in potential prognostic biomarkers, including Ddimer, IL6 and cardiac specific troponins Our aim was to provide a scoping review of the available literature regarding thrombosis risk, other cardiovascular implications, and their biomarkers in COVID19 to highlight potential disease mechanisms METHODS Authors conducted a literature search in PubMed using MeSH headings disseminated intravascular coagulation, pulmonary embolism, thromb, stroke, myocardial infarction and acute lung injury, as well as terms COVID19, SARSCoV2, 2019 novel coronavirus and 2019nCoV RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS COVID19 disease is characterised by the interactions between hyperactive coagulation and complement systems  induced by hyperinflammatory conditions, resulting in a prothrombotic state and diffuse tissue injury There are several promising prognostic markers of disease severity, with Ddimer the most significant The presence of thrombocytopenia appears to be a key indicator of patient deterioration Further research is required to understand the underlying pathophysiology in COVID19 and its implications in disease progression and patient management Randomised trials are urgently needed to determine the safety of proposed therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin and the role for antiplatelet agents, such as Ticagrelor, in patient management,Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19, a respiratory syndrome, is a global pandemic Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore mechanisms implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease Clinical and autopsy studies show a complex chain of events preceding COVID19related death The disease is characterized by endothelial dysfunction, platelet activation, thrombosis, coagulopathy, and multiple organ failure Globally, millions of patients with coronary heart disease undergo percutaneous coronary intervention PCI each year These patients undergo highintensity antithrombotic therapy during hospitalization and dual antiplatelet therapy DAPT for at least 6 months post PCI COVID19 is characterized by changes in platelet counts Treatment of ischemic events that occur during stent implantation is associated with bleeding complications in patients following PCI complicated by COVID19 This review summarizes recent progress in activation status and levels of COVID19related platelet changes These findings will provide information on the effectiveness of antithrombotic therapy for the management of platelet changes in COVID19 patients,A previously healthy 37yearold man presented with fevers and myalgias for a week with a minimal dry cough Initial SARSCoV2 nasopharyngeal testing was negative, but in light of high community prevalence, he was diagnosed with COVID19, treated with supportive care and selfquarantined at home Three days after resolution of all symptoms, he developed sudden onset chest pain Chest imaging revealed a large rightsided pneumothorax and patchy subpleural ground glass opacities IgM and IgG antibodies for SARSCoV2 were positive His pneumothorax resolved after placement of a smallbore chest tube, which was removed after 2u2009daysThis case demonstrates that patients with COVID19 can develop a significant pulmonary complication, a large pneumothorax, despite only minimal lower respiratory tract symptoms and after resolution of the original illness Medical professionals should consider development of a pneumothorax in patients who have recovered from COVID19 and present with new respiratory symptoms,PURPOSE To describe perfusion patterns of peripheral pulmonary lesions PPLs in COVID19 patients using contrastenhanced ultrasound CEUS PATIENTS AND METHODS From April 2020 until July 2020, 11 consecutive patients with RTPCRconfirmed COVID19 and PPLs sized over 5u2009mm were investigated by Bmode ultrasound BUS and CEUS The homogeneity of enhancement homogeneous and inhomogeneous was examined retrospectively using CEUS An inhomogeneous enhancement was defined as a perfused lesion with coexisting nonperfused areas NPA RESULTS On BUS, all 11 patients showed an interstitial syndrome Blines with PPLs between 05 and 6u2009cm On CEUS, all cases showed peripheral NPA during the complete CEUS examination One patient underwent a partial lung resection with subsequent histopathological examination The histological examination showed vasculitis, microthrombus in the alveolar capillary, and small obliterated vessels CONCLUSION In our case series, PPLs in patients with RTPCRconfirmed COVID19 infection presented a CEUS pattern with NPA during the complete CEUS examination Our findings suggest a peripheral pulmonary perfusion disturbance in patients with COVID19 infection In 1 case, the histopathological correlation with the perfusion disturbance in the PPL was proven,,Background Hypertension HTN affects approximately 25 of the UK population and is a leading cause of mortality Associated annual health care costs run into billions National treatment guidance includes initial lifestyle advice, followed by antihypertensive medication if blood pressure BP remains high However, adoption and adherence to recommended exercise guidelines, dietary advice and antihypertensive medication is poor Four short bouts of isometric exercise IE performed

worse outcomes RESEARCH QUESTION Can distinct comorbidity profiles be identified and validated in a communitybased sample of patients with COPD from a large integrated health care system using a standard, commonly used diagnostic codebased comorbidity index and downstream 2year health care utilization data STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS In this retrospective cohort study, we used latent class analysis LCA to identify comorbidity profiles in a populationbased sample of 91,453 patients with a COPD diagnosis between 2011 and 2015 We included specific comorbid conditions from the Charlson Comorbidity Index CCI and accounted for variation in underlying prevalence of different comorbidities across the three study sites Sociodemographic, clinical and health care utilization data were obtained from electronic health records EHR Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare rates of acute and postacute care utilization by class RESULTS The mean age was 7111 years, 55 were females, 23 were persons of color, and 80 were former or current smokers LCA identified four distinct comorbidity profiles with progressively higher CCI scores low morbidity 61, 19  14, metabolicrenal 21, 47  18, cardiovascular 12, 46  19, and multimorbidity 7, 75  17 In multivariable models, during 2years of follow up, there was a significant, nonoverlapping increase in the odds of having any allcause acute hospitalizations, observation stays and emergency department visits and postacute care utilization across the comorbidity profiles INTERPRETATION Distinct comorbidity profiles can be identified in patients with COPD using standard EHR based diagnostic codes, and these profiles are associated with subsequent acute and postacute care utilization Populationbased risk stratification schemes for endtoend, comprehensive COPD management should consider integrating comorbidity profiles such as those found in this study CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION Not applicable,BackgroundEarly suspicion followed by assessing lung function with spirometry could decrease the underdiagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD in primary care We aimed to develop a nomogram to predict the FEV1FVC ratio and the presence of COPD MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed the data of 4241 adult patients who underwent spirometry between 2013 and 2019 By linear regression analysis, variables associated with FEV1FVC were identified in the training cohort nu2009u20092969 Using the variables as predictors, a nomogram was created to predict the FEV1FVC ratio and validated in the test cohort nu2009u20091272ResultsOlder age β coefficient 95 CI, u20090153 u20090183, u20090122, male sex u20091904 u20092749, u20091056, current or past smoking history u20093324 u20094200, u20092453, and the presence of dyspnea u20092453 u20093612, u20091291 or overweight 0894 0191, 1598 were significantly associated with the FEV1FVC ratio In the final testing, the developed nomogram showed a mean absolute error of 82 between the predicted and actual FEV1FVC ratios The overall performance was best when FEV1FVC,Abstract Largescale efforts have been persistently undertaken for medical prophylaxis and treatment of COVID19 disasters worldwide A variety of novel viral spike proteintargeted vaccine preparations have recently been clinically distributed based on accelerated approval We revisited the early but inconclusive clinical interest in the combination of azithromycin and zinc sulfate repurposing with safety advantages In vitro proof of concept was provided for rapid and synergistic suppression of ACE2 expression following treatments in human airway cells, Calu3 and H322M The two representative ACE2expressing human airway cells indicate the upper and lower respiratory tracts Prophylactic and early therapeutic roles of azithromycin combined with zinc are proposed for virus cellular entry prevention potential bridging to effective antibody production,BackgroundGroundglass opacity GGO and consolidation opacity CLO are the common CT lung opacities, and their heterogeneity may have potential for prognosis in COVID19 patients This study aimed to estimate clinical outcome in individual COVID19 patient by using histogram heterogeneity analysis based on CT opacities Methods71 COVID19 cases medical records were retrospectively reviewed from a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, from January 24th to February 28th at the early stage of pandemic Two characteristic lung abnormity opacities, GGO and CLO were drawn on CT images to identify the heterogeneity by using quantitative histogram analysis The parameters mean, mode, kurtosis, skewness were derived from histograms to evaluate the accuracy of clinical classification and outcome prediction Nomograms were built to predict the risk of death and median length of hospital stays LOS, respectively Results A total of 57 cases were eligible for the study cohort after exclusion 14 cases The most highly frequency of lung abnormalities was GGO mixed with CLO in both survival population 26 in 42, 619 and died population 10 in 15, 667 The best performance heterogeneity parameters to discriminate severe type from mildmoderate counterparts were as following GGOskewness specificity6667, sensitivity7812, AUC0706 CLOmean specificity7000, sensitivity7692, AUC0746 Nomogram based on histogram parameters has the ability to predict the individual risk of death and the prolonged median LOS of COVID19 patients Cindexes were 0763 and 0888 for risk of death and prolonged median LOS, respectivelyConclusionsThe histogram analysis method based on GGO and CLO has the ability for individual risk prediction in COVID19 patients,Objective To characterize the clinical and transthoracic echocardiographic features and 30day outcomes of hospitalized patients with COVID19 Methods Retrospective cohort study that included 179 consecutive inpatients with COVID19 who underwent clinically indicated transthoracic echocardiography at 10 sites in the Mayo Clinic Health System between March 10 and August 5, 2020 Echocardiography was performed at bedside by cardiac sonographers according to an abbreviated protocol Echocardiographic results, demographics, laboratory findings, and clinical outcomes were analysed Results Of the 179 patients, age 598 169 years and 108 60 men, events within 30 days occurred in 70 39 patients including prolonged hospitalization in 43 24 and death in 27 15 Echocardiographic abnormalities included left ventricular ejection fraction  50 in 29 16, regional wall motion abnormalities in 26 15, and right ventricular systolic pressure RVSP 35 mm Hg in 44 25 Myocardial injury, defined as the presence of significant troponin elevation accompanied by new ventricular dysfunction or electrocardiographic abnormalities, was present in 13 7 Prior echocardiography was available in 36 20 and preexisting abnormalities were seen in 28 78 of these In a multivariable ageadjusted model, AUC 081, prior cardiovascular disease, troponin, Ddimer, and RVSP were related to events at 30 days Conclusion Bedside Doppler assessment of RVSP appears promising for shortterm risk stratification in hospitalized COVID19 patients undergoing clinically indicated echocardiography Preexisting echocardiographic abnormalities were common caution should be exercised in attributing such abnormalities to the COVID19 infection in this comorbid patient population,Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID19 caused by 2019 novel coronavirus named SARSCoV2, has become a global pandemic Aged population with cardiovascular diseases is usually more susceptible to SARSCoV2 infection with an increased risk of severe complications and elevated casefatality rate Despite of several researches about COVID19, cardiovascular implications related to this infection still remain largely unclear The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical characteristics of dead patients with COVID19 We enrolled all patients with more than 50 years of age with laboratory confirmed COVID19, admitted to infectious clinical diseases PO SS Annunziata of Chieti Italy from March 2020 to April 2020 who died during hospitalization Demographics, underlying comorbidities, clinical symptoms and signs, laboratory results, computed tomography of the chest, treatment measures, and outcome data were collected We enrolled eight patients, the age was 82  97 years, four female and four male All patients had comorbidity, such as hypertension 7 875, diabetes 1 125, and heart disease 6 75 Common symptoms included fever 8 100, dry cough 11256, and dyspnea 3 375 All patients 8 100 showed local andor bilateral patchy shadowing on chest computed tomography that is the typical radiological finding in COVID19 Lymphopenia was observed in seven patients 875 All patients showed elevated troponin and prolongation of the QTc interval  p  005 In this study we demonstrated that in SARSCoV2 infection, the deaths occurred in the nonICU population with more than 50 years are related to cardiac causes In our cases elongation of QTc and alteration in troponin are present in all patients who died and could represent a data to better stratify the population at risk More detailed research on cardiovascular involvement in COVID19 patients with sudden deaths showed a predictive role of troponin and QTc elongation,Supplemental oxygen therapy with supraphysiological concentrations of oxygen hyperoxia 21 O2 is a lifesaving intervention for patients experiencing respiratory distress However, prolonged exposure to hyperoxia can compromise bacterial clearance processes, due to oxidative stressmediated impairment of macrophages, contributing to the increased susceptibility to pulmonary infections This study reports that the activation of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α7nAChR with the delete allosteric agonisticpositive allosteric modulator, GAT107, decreases the bacterial burden in mouse lungs by improving hyperoxiainduced lung redox imbalance The incubation of RAW 2647 cells with GAT107 33 µM rescues hyperoxiacompromised phagocytic functions in cultured macrophages, RAW 2647 cells, and primary bone marrowderived macrophages Similarly, GAT107 33 µM also attenuated oxidative stress in hyperoxiaexposed macrophages, which prevents oxidation and hyperpolymerization of phagosome filamentous actin Factin from oxidation Furthermore, GAT107 33 µM increases the 1 activity of superoxide dismutase 1 2 activation of Nrf2 and 3 the expression of heme oxygenase1 HO1 in macrophages exposed to hyperoxia Overall, these data suggest that the novel α7nAChR compound, GAT107, could be used to improve host defense functions in patients, such as those with COVID19, who are exposed to prolonged periods of hyperoxia,,The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has had a positive impact on the outcomes after lung transplantation Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has a role in all phases of lung transplantation—preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative periods It serves as a bridge to transplantation in appropriate patients awaiting lung transplantation Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is used as a preferred method of cardiopulmonary support in some centres during implantation and, after lung transplantation, it can be used to salvage the implanted lung in cases of severe primary graft dysfunction or as a planned extension of intraoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation onto the postoperative period It has now gained acceptance as a mandatory tool in most lung transplant units This article reviews the history of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and lung transplantation, their subsequent development, and the current use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during lung transplantation Our institutional practice and experience are described The implications of the current global coronavirus disease pandemic on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and lung transplantation are also briefly discussed,Inflammation is an essential component of several respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD, asthma and acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS It is central to lung cancer, the leading cancer in terms of associated mortality that has affected millions of individuals worldwide Inflammation and pulmonary manifestations are also the major causes of COVID19 related deaths Acute hyperinflammation plays an important role in the COVID19 disease progression and severity, and development of protective immunity against the virus is greatly sought Further, the severity of COVID19 is greatly enhanced in lung cancer patients, probably due to the genes such as ACE2, TMPRSS2, PAI1 and furin that are commonly involved in cancer progression as well as SARCoV2 infection The importance of inflammation in pulmonary manifestations, cancer and COVID19 calls for a closer look at the underlying processes, particularly the associated increase in IL6 and other cytokines, the dysregulation of immune cells and the coagulation pathway Towards this end, several reports have identified epigenetic regulation of inflammation at different levels Expression of several key inflammationrelated cytokines, chemokines and other genes is affected by methylation and acetylation while noncoding RNAs, including microRNAs as well as long noncoding RNAs, also affect the overall inflammatory responses Select miRNAs can regulate inflammation in COVID19 infection, lung cancer as well as other inflammatory lung diseases, and can serve as epigenetic links that can be therapeutically targeted Furthermore, epigenetic changes also mediate the environmental factorsinduced inflammation Therefore, a better understanding of epigenetic regulation of inflammation can potentially help develop novel strategies to prevent, diagnose and treat chronic pulmonary diseases, lung cancer and COVID19,The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19, caused by SARSCoV2, has become a global challenge to public health While its typical clinical manifestations are respiratory disorders, emerging evidence of cardiovascular complications indicates the adverse interaction between SARSCoV2 infection and cardiovascular outcomes Given that viral infection has emerged as an additional risk factor for atherosclerosis, in this paper, we attempt to clarify the susceptibility to newonset atherosclerosis in individuals infected with SARSCoV2 Mechanistically, serving as functional receptors for SARSCoV2, angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2 mediates SARSCoV2 infection of endothelial cells ECs directly, leading to endothelial dysfunction and dysregulation of the reninangiotensin system RAS In addition, high expression of CD147, an alternative receptor, and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome may also contribute to atherosclerosis in the context of COVID19 More importantly, SARSCoV2 attacks the immune system, which results in excessive inflammation and perpetuates a vicious cycle of deteriorated endothelial dysfunction that further promotes inflammation The alterations in the blood lipid profile induced by COVID19 should not be ignored in assessing the predisposition toward atherosclerosis in victims of COVID19 A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of SARSCoV2 infection and the longterm monitoring of inflammatory factors and endothelial function should be considered in the followup of patients who have recovered from COVID19 for early detection and prevention of atherosclerosis,Corresponding Author,Sickle cell disease SCD is a common inherited clinical syndrome, characterized by the presence of hemoglobin S Anemia, susceptibility to infections and episodes of vasoocclusive crisis VOC are among its features Since SCD complications VOC or delayed hemolytic transfusion reactionDHTR lead to significant morbidity and mortality, a number of studies have addressed their pathophysiology Although SCD pathophysiology has been mainly attributed to the interaction between sickle cells and neutrophils, platelets or endothelial cells in small vessels leading to hemolysis, the role of complement activation has been increasingly investigated Importantly, complement inhibition with eculizumab has shown beneficial effects in DHTR Given the unmet clinical need of novel therapeutics in SCD, our review summarizes current understanding of a complement system for the clinician, b complement activation in SCD both in asymptomatic state and severe clinical manifestations, c probable underlying mechanisms of complement activation in SCD, and d new therapeutic perspective of complement inhibition,Identifying undiagnosed COPD is high priority1 Systematic, targeted casefinding in eversmokers is costeffective, outperforming routine primary care however, even within the research setting of TargetCOPD, only 38 responded to screening questionnaires determining spirometry need1 We explored the feasibility of an alternative  database search and triage of patient record by GP, to create an atrisk group for spirometry, as part of an integrated respiratory service development An EMIS GP database search was iteratively developed to identify patients at risk of COPD, which included eversmokers 3590 years, who had also received relevant medication or had multiple respiratory consultations In protected time, three nonspecialist GPs reviewed the record to identify likely airways disease and triaged to screening spirometry, diagnostic spirometry, no testing indicated or coding required as diagnostic criteria already present The patient and their GP were informed of COPD and asthma diagnoses Of 1231 patients in 20 practices who were highlighted by the search and received triage of their record, 8 98 required coding, 41 500, were triaged to screening spirometry and 15 180 direct to diagnostic spirometry 37 453 were considered irrelevant Triage time was 12 patientshour In total, 81 COPD and 53 asthma cases were identified 65 93143 of patients attended on first invitation for spirometry and 55 of those who had diagnostic spirometry had airways disease COPD 22 and asthma 14 After screening spirometry, 207 went on to be diagnosed with COPD At project termination due to COVID19, 537 patients had yet to be invited for spirometry and no second invitations had been sent Availability of diagnostic spirometry and its interpretation in primary care was variable, especially when complex specialist support was required Our search strategy was specific, creating a manageable sample for clinical triage and followup spirometry in routine settings The process resulted in a high rate of diagnoses after spirometry and allowed rapid recognition of uncoded patients, equating to ≈69 additional COPD cases over routine care1 Jordan RE, et al Targeted casefinding for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease versus routine practice in primary care TargetCOPD a clusterrandomised controlled trial LancetRespir Med 201649720730,Asthma is a condition that involves airway inflammation leading to variable bronchial constriction It is wellestablished that blood eosinophil counts are often raised in patients with asthma and correlate with increased brochial hyperreactivity1 However, blood eosinophils are not currently recommended for monitoring asthma in adults2 Many patients admitted to hospital have undergone a full blood count in the year prior to their index attack and this is an easy opportunity to assess their risk of exacerbation and intervene We elected to review patients admitted to hospital at the Countess of Chester Hospital NHS Foundation Trust over a 12month period We investigated whether a full blood count was available and also, if there was evidence of raised blood eosinophil counts We also recorded information on treatment and length of stay 197 patients were included, 58 female and 139 male, with a mean age of 50 years range 1213 A total of 135 685 patients had FBC recorded in the 12 months prior to admission 87 6444 of these had an eosinophil count of 03 at least once in the 12 month period 70 355 patients had an eosinophil count of 03 on admission The average eosinophil count over the 12 months prior to admission was 036 range 031 Patients with an eosinophil count of 03 were more likely to be using LABAICS combination than their counterparts 5143 vs 4409 No significant difference was noted with other therapies A high proportion of patients admitted to hospital had a historical FBC available Twothirds had recorded an eosinophil count of 03 in the 12 months leading up to admission suggesting an increased risk of a severe asthma exacerbation There is an opportunity to intervene to prevent future exacerbations An incidental raised blood eosinophil count in asthmatics should be regarded as a red flag for future asthma attacks Price DB, Rigazio A,

Optimal method for noninvasive assessment of venous congestion remains an unresolved issue Portal vein PV and intrarenal venous flow alterations are markers of abdominal venous congestion and have been associated with acute kidney injury AKI in cardiac surgery patients It is currently unknown if portal vein flow PVF alterations in heart failure can be reversed with diuretic treatment and track decongestion OBJECTIVE The aim of this study is to evaluate PVF alterations in patients with ADHF at arrival and after decongestive treatment METHODS Assessment of venous congestion using pointofcare ultrasound was performed in 12 patients with ADHF 6 patients with leftsided heart failure and 6 patients with rightsided heart failure Evaluation included inferior vena cava IVC size and collapsibility in addition to PV Doppler to determine pulsatility fraction PF RESULTS Increased PV PF 8175  13 was found on admission After effective decongestive treatment, it improved to 1743  22 Improvement in IVC size and collapsibility was seen in most patients with leftsided heart failure and none of the patients with rightsided heart failure Improvement in PV PF coincided with return to baseline of Serum Cr in patients that presented with AKI CONCLUSIONS Evaluation of abdominal venous congestion by pointofcare ultrasound could aid in diagnosis and followup of patients with congestive kidney injury,Continuous positive airway pressure CPAP may be a useful treatment strategy for patients with severe COVID19 pneumonia but its effectiveness in preventing mechanical ventilation is unknown We aimed to evaluate the outcomes of COVID19 patients treated with CPAP and determine predictors of CPAP response This was a retrospective observational cohort study which took place in the intensive care unit at Royal Papworth Hospital RPH in Cambridge, UK We included all consecutive patients with confirmed COVID19 pneumonia who were transferred from neighbouring hospitals between 14th March and 6th May, 2020 for consideration of ventilatory support We instituted the use of CPAP for all patients who arrived in RPH not intubated and were not making satisfactory progress on supplemental oxygen alone Of 33 selfventilating patients included in this study, 22 667 were male and the mean age was 5413 23 patients received CPAP They were more hypoxaemic than those treated with oxygen alone PaO2FiO2 ratio 843190 vs 1700460 mmHg, p 0001 There was a significant improvement in PaO2FiO2 ratio 12 hours after CPAP initiation 1674490 from 843190 mmHg, p 0001 with no indication that CPAP augmented minute ventilation pH actually fell from 748004 to 745004, p0000 and PaCO2 increased from 455078 mmHg to 488083 mmHg, p0001 14 61 patients responded to CPAP and 9 required intubation There was no difference between these two groups in terms of the severity of baseline hypoxaemia but CPAP responders had significantly lower Creactive protein, interleukin6 and Ddimer see table 1 CT pulmonary angiogram was performed in 6 out of 9 intubated patients and demonstrated pulmonary emboli in 5 of them All patients were discharged from ICU and there were no fatalities In this cohort, CPAP was an effective treatment modality to improve hypoxaemia and prevent invasive ventilation in a substantial proportion of patients with severe respiratory failure Accepting the small sample size, we also found that raised biomarkers of inflammation CRP and IL6 and coagulopathy DDimer to be more useful predictors of CPAP responsiveness than the severity of hypoxaemia, and could help to guide

infection control measures rely solely on RTPCR testing of cases with high index of suspicion for COVID19 The seroprevalence of SARSCoV2specific antibodies in the populations remains unknown We aimed to determine the seroprevalence of SARS CoV2 IgM and IgG in screened blood donors in two selected cities in Nigeriaxa0Methods A total of 113 blood samples from screened and accepted blood donors were tested for both SARS CoV2 IgM and IgG antibodies using NOVATECH ELISA kits from Eurofins Germany Results The age range of donor was 2148 years Males were 96  Of the 113 blood donors 42 were positive for SARS CoV2 IgG while 41 were positive for SARS CoV2 IgM respectively Only 11 and 19 of blood donors had equivocal test result for IgG and IgM respectivelyConclusions Nearly a half of accepted blood donors in Nigeria had been exposed to SARS CoV2 infection Although it is not a blood transmissible infection, the blood banks must take adequate preventive measures to prevent spread amongst the bank staff and potential donors It also implies a wider spread of the infection in NigeriaTrial Registration The study does not require registration,Cardiac amyloidosis is an emerging and important cause of heart failure, arrhythmia, and other cardiovascular disease in Canada In this context, many centres have expressed interest in the development of effective care pathways for screening, evaluating, and treating this rapidly growing patient population In October 2019, a group of Canadian stakeholders met, including specialists in cardiac amyloidosis, experts in heart failure and chronic disease management, and academic and communitybased cardiologists at various stages of cardiac amyloidosis clinic development Objectives of the meetings included discussion of existing care pathways, consideration of barriers to program development, and achieving a consensus on essential and desirable components of a bestpractice cardiac amyloidosis program Topics discussed included optimal settings for cardiac amyloidosis clinics and integration with other specialty clinics, funding limitations that act as barriers to program development and potential solutions to these barriers, the roles of the multidisciplinary team and specialist physicians in amyloidosis care, and diagnostic pathways and strategies for the identification of patients with cardiac amyloidosis In this report, we summarize the discussion points and key recommendations for the development of a cardiac amyloidosis clinic that emerged from this meeting, focused on program integration and care coordination, human resource elements, access to care, and quality improvement and outcome measures in cardiac amyloidosis,Conventional lung function testing involves forced expiratory manoeuvres which risk aerosolisation of respiratory droplets and nosocomial transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 SARSCoV2COVID19 Betweenpatient decontamination procedures render routine testing impractical Parasternal electromyography EMGpara is an effortindependent method of assessing inspiratory muscle activity that tracks clinical trajectory in COPD, cystic fibrosis and pulmonary fibrosis We evaluated EMGpara as a method of monitoring respiratory muscle function during recovery from COVID19 pneumonia in PostCOVID clinic Prospective singlecentre observational cohort study 05Q070382 All patients hospitalised with severe COVID19 pneumonia oxygen requirement 40 or critical care admission were invited to clinic 68 weeks postdischarge EMGpara was recorded in consecutive patients

This makes it a practical and informative measure of lung function during the COVID19 pandemic,COVID19 posed unprecedented challenges on healthcare systems globally especially on inpatient beds, oxygen and ventilatory support continuous positive airway pressure CPAP, high flow nasal oxygen and invasive mechanical ventilation IMV West Herts NHS Trust, a secondary care provider for a population of 650,000 had 1200 admissions during the first wave March to June with a 30 mortality Ventilatory outcomes in 116 consecutive admissions were analysed to assess the utility of CPAP in a respiratory specialist ward versus ITU, and prompt versus delayed invasive mechanical ventilation IMV Respiratory support was provided in four pathways CPAP in intensive care unit ITU n18, CPAP in respiratory ward setting usually as ceiling of care, n50, IMV after initial trial of CPAP n21 and IMV with no delay or interim CPAP n27 The demographics, comorbidities, functional status, severity of presentation and outcomes differed greatly between the ward group and all the ITU arms Within the ITU arms, patients were younger, had worse chest xrays, higher CRP as well as had lower lymphocyte counts, PF PaO2FiO2 ratios and comorbidities Delayed intubation with a trial of CPAP was associated with significant mortality compared to prompt IMV All ventilatory outcomes were poor in patients over 80 years Mortality rate was significantly lower in prompt IMV, 37, compared to 95 in those with a delayed intubation by a median of 6 days with a prior CPAP trial Median PF ratio on admission for patients with prompt IMV was 73 mmHg vs 115 mmHg in those with CPAP prior to IMV In summary, ward CPAP as ceiling of care for older patients and with comorbidities is safe and associated with a relatively similar mortality rate compared to ITU CPAP but must be reviewed regularly to ensure improvement on treatment Mortality is significant in those with lower PF ratios especially if IMV is delayed Whilst acknowledging the heavy burden on clinicians to rationalise treatment during times of limited resources, we believe that careful assessment of age, comorbidities cardiac and frailty, PF ratios, CRP and a 24 hourly review should be undertaken to prevent delayed IMV in appropriate patients Clinical characteristics and outcomes of ventilator support in COVID19 patients,Lung function testing is not listed as an aerosol generating procedure AGP by Public Health England1 However, the tests may often generate droplets or aerosols due to the production of high flow rates and cough post manoeuvre This has led to the BTSARTP to recommend appropriate precautions during laboratory assessment2 The aim of the study was to investigate cough occurrence during lung function tests Patients male  64, female  58 age m62 2489, BMI m28 1450, with Asthma n13, Cancer n11, Bronchiectasis n4, COPD n7, ILD n34, undiagnosed n24, post COVID n24 and other n5, were referred for urgent lung function testing during the COVID19 pandemic response between June and August The occurrence of cough was recorded in the laboratory prior to testing, during and after spirometry FEV1 045506L, FVC 139611L, transfer factor TLCO 1691221 mmolminkPa, KCO 043189 mmolminkPaL and static lung volumes TLC 159895L Preexisting cough was checked prior to testing Lung function tests provoked cough as shown in the following table table 1 Lung function tests provoked a cough in patients who had a preexisting cough and also those who did not have a preexisting cough Spirometry results did not predict cough occurrence during the test, FEV1 m82 predicted 19129 predicted and FVC m92 predicted 39138 predicted Cough occurrence during lung function More than half of patients attending for spirometry coughed immediately after the procedure Spirometry was more likely to provoke cough, although transfer factor and static lung volume measurements were also associated with posttest cough Additionally, a patients coughing history does not predict the absence of coughing Lung function tests therefore pose a considerable risk for the spread of infection to individuals and surrounding surfaces within test areas ARTP COVID19 Group  2020 COVID19 Infection Control Issues for Lung Function ARTP Pasnick, S  2020 SARSCoV2 transmission and the risk of aerosolgenerating procedures American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, 1314,Imaging plays an important role in assessing severity of COVID19 pneumonia The recent COVID19 researches indicate that in many cases, disease progress propagates from the bottom of the lungs to the top However, semantic interpretation of chest radiography CXR findings do not provide a quantitative description of radiographic opacities, and the existing AIassisted CXR image analysis frameworks do not quantify the severity regionally To address this issue, we propose a deep learningbased fourregion lung segmentation method to assist accurate quantification of COVID19 pneumonia Specifically, a segmentation model to separate left and right lung is firstly applied, and then a carina and left hilum detection network is used to separate the upper and lower lungs To improve the segmentation performance of COVID19 images, ensemble strategy with five models is exploited For each region, we evaluated the clinical relevance of the proposed method compared with the Radiographic Assessment of the Quality of Lung Edema RALE The proposed ensemble strategy showed dice score of 0900, which outperforms the conventional methods Mean intensities of segmented four regions indicate positive correlation to the extent and density scores of pulmonary opacities based on the RALE framework Therefore, the proposed method can accurately segment fourregions of the lungs and quantify regional pulmonary opacities of COVID19 pneumonia patients,Intensive surveillance of lung function FEV1, body weight and airway microbiology is central to good cystic fibrosis CF care National standards recommend people with CF pwCF are reviewed at least three monthly by specialist multidisciplinary teams COVID19 shielding precautions, set to protect clinically extremely vulnerable people, terminated all but essential facetoface clinical contact for over four months Many pwCF remain apprehensive as restrictions ease The Kings Adult CF Unit delivers care to 250 pwCF across southeast England We discuss the immediate service changes in response to COVID19, and the effect on patient outcomes of limited clinician review At the start of shielding the entire patient cohort was reviewed and grouped as stable or of concern Telephone andor video clinics were implemented, and patients identified as high risk were prioritised for remote selfmonitoring FEV1 with Bluetooth home spirometers, weight, postal sputum samples Home visits or ward reviews, by specialist nurses or physiotherapists, were arranged if clinically essential We undertook a cohort review of consecutive patients emerging from shielding to compare clinical parameters before and after lockdown Since shielding ended, 24 consecutive patients see table 1 have been reviewed, at a median IQR of 167 155, 180 days after preCOVID assessments At review, 2 patients had a clinically significant fall in lung function 10, however no statistical difference in FEV1, weight or BMI n21 was seen overall

Data presented as mean  SD, or median IQR At start of shielding Unpredicted changes to CF care delivery at our centre was not detrimental to patient outcomes In this cohort, key CF clinical indices remained stable over a short period of shielding, supporting safe remote delivery of care Modulator therapies likely contributed to the stability in lung function seen,During the first wave of the COVID19 pandemic in the UK there was a reduction in AE attendances and hospital admissions Monthly excess deaths peaked in April 2020 driven by COVID191 We investigated whether hospital admissions due to asthma were reduced in April 2020 compared to the previous five years and if this was accompanied by an increase in asthma deaths Fiveyear data were obtained from Public Health Scotland from the time period January 2015 to June 2020 Hospital admission data was sourced from Public Health Scotlands Scottish Morbidity Records, death certificate data from National Records of Scotland and AE attendance data from Public Health Scotland Data were analysed using statistical process control charts AE presentations in April 2020 reduced to 44 of April 2019 Hospital admissions for all conditions reduced, as did asthma admissions figure 1a 218 in April 2020 versus previous 5 year mean of 418 7958 deaths occurred in April 2020 an excess of 2731 from previous 5year mean In 130 deaths asthma was recorded on the death certificate as either the underlying or the contributory cause, giving rise to around 100 apparent excess deaths versus the previous 5year mean of 275 figure 1b Asthma was recorded as the underlying cause of death in 7 cases, comparable with the previous 5 year mean of 92 deaths figure 1c The age distribution of those with asthma on the death certificate was 97 65, 27 aged 4565, 6 aged 1844 and 0 18 years Of the 123 patients with asthma recorded as a contributory cause, 81 had COVID19 recorded as the underlying cause of death All 7 patients with asthma recorded as underlying cause of death were elderly and the location of death was 3 at home, 2 in residential care, 1 in hospital and 1 in a hospice Statistical Process charts of 1a Emergency Asthma Admissions from January 2015 to April 2020 1b Deaths with Asthma Recorded as underlying or Contrubutory Cause of Death on Death Certificate January 2015 to June 2020 1c Deaths with Asthma Recorded as underlying or contributory Cause of Death on Death Certificate January 15 to June 2020 Reduced acute healthcare utilisation by people with asthma during the first peak of COVID19 did not appear to result in increased mortality where asthma was the primary underlying cause of death Scottish Government COVID19 in Scotland 2020 04 November 2020 Available from httpsdatagovscotcoronaviruscovid19indexhtml,In May 2020, BTS published guidelines on radiological followup for patients with COVID19 pneumonia, advising an initial repeat chest radiograph at 12 weeks to assess resolution1 It is unclear whether persistent chest radiograph changes are clinically significant Our aim was to assess whether there is a correlation between postCOVID chest radiograph appearances and ongoing respiratory symptoms Inpatients at two trust hospital sites diagnosed with COVID19, either clinically or from a positive nasopharyngeal swab, were followedup via telephone approximately 68 weeks postdischarge Patients were offered a chest radiograph and blood tests if abnormal and a symptomatic assessment via a proforma Patients subjectively rated their degree of breathlessness, cough and fatigue using a numerical rating scale Chest radiograph reports were coded by consultant radiologists as per BSTI guidelines2 and grouped into improvers PCVCX01 and nonimprovers PCVCX23 ie static or worsening appearances Patients who had both an initial and followup chest radiograph, and who completed a proforma were included for retrospective analysis 382 patients were included, with a median IQR time to followup of 56 days 44  68 Baseline characteristics are shown in table 1 93 of patients had significantly improved radiographs Patients with radiographs that were classified as nonimprovers were significantly more breathless subjectively compared to improvers NRS 2 0  4 vs 1 0  3, p 001, MRC scale 1 1  3 vs 1 1  2, p 0021 They were also more likely to have been admitted to ITU 1026 385 vs 41356 115, p 0001 Differences in symptom burden in patients with improved vs nonimproved chest radiographs nonparametric data presented as median and IQR, all other data are presented as mean  standard deviation In our cohort, patients recovering from COVID19 pneumonia with a nonimprover chest radiograph are more likely to have been admitted to ITU and remain breathless at followup We conclude that nonimprover chest radiographs at followup are an indicator of who may have ongoing respiratory pathology These patients can thus be prioritised for further respiratory investigation British Thoracic Society 2020

hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 patients METHODS u2003A retrospective cohort study of hospitalized adult patients admitted to an integrated health care network in the New York metropolitan region between March 1, 2020 and April 27, 2020 The final analysis included 9,407 patients with an overall VTE rate of 29 24 in the medical ward and 49 in the intensive care unit ICU and a VTE or mortality rate of 261 Most patients received prophylacticdose thromboprophylaxis Multivariable analysis showed significantly reduced VTE or mortality with Black race, history of hypertension, angiotensin converting enzymeangiotensin receptor blocker use, and initial prophylactic anticoagulation It also showed significantly increased VTE or mortality with age 60 years or greater, Charlson Comorbidity Index CCI of 3 or greater, patients on Medicare, history of heart failure, history of cerebrovascular disease, body mass index greater than 35, steroid use, antirheumatologic medication use, hydroxychloroquine use, maximum Ddimer four times or greater than the upper limit of normal ULN, ICU level of care, increasing creatinine, and decreasing platelet counts CONCLUSION u2003In our large cohort of hospitalized COVID19 patients, the overall inhospital VTE rate was 29 49 in the ICU and a VTE or mortality rate of 261 Key predictors of VTE or mortality included advanced age, increasing CCI, history of cardiovascular disease, ICU level of care, and elevated maximum Ddimer with a cutoff at least four times the ULN Use of prophylacticdose anticoagulation but not treatmentdose anticoagulation was associated with reduced VTE or mortality,UK public health policy emphasises the need for increased influenza vaccination during the COVID19 pandemic However, there are claims on social media that influenza vaccination increases risk of adverse outcomes in SARSCoV2 infection that may compromise uptake, especially in high risk groups such as those with airways disease There is also emerging evidence that inhaled corticosteroids ICS may modify this risk We therefore sought to urgently assess the risk of morbidity and mortality in individuals admitted with COVID19, and whether this influenced by influenza vaccination, airways disease and ICS use We examined data in patients admitted to a large acute hospital with microbiologically proven COVID19 infection positive PCR between 23012020 to 21062020 Demographic and outcome data was extracted from discharge summaries, death certificates and electronic patient records Multiple logistic regressions was performed using STATA version 12, and results for inpatient mortality expressed as odds ratios, and length of stay morbidity as coefficients with 95 CIs 525 patients were hospitalised with COVID19 of whom 451 had a vaccination record available and 64 had been vaccinated 22 had airways disease 10 asthma, 12 COPD and 175 were on an inhaled corticosteroid Increasing age OR104 102, 105, p0001 and male gender OR226 15, 34, p0001 were important predictors of inpatient mortality Previous influenza vaccination OR099 06, 16, p098, the presence of airways disease Asthma OR074 04, 15, p041, COPD OR 11 06, 20, p068, and ICS use OR084 03, 21, p071 did not increase risk of inhospital mortality and were not associated with an increased length of stay, after adjusting for age and gender Further subanalysis including type of airways disease and dose of ICS did not change the risk Demonstrating Vaccine, Airways Disease and ICS Vaccination data available for 451 patients, type of vaccine known for 137 Advancing age and male gender increased the risk of inhospital mortality from COVID19 Furthermore previous influenza vaccination and the presence of airways disease andor the use of ICS did not impact morbidity or mortality Whilst this requires replication using national data sets, it is reassuring data from a single centre that supports the current public health message,Mycobacterium tuberculosis Mtb, the causative organism of pulmonary tuberculosis PTB now infects more than half of the world population The efficient transmission strategy of the pathogen includes first remaining dormant inside the infected host, next undergoing reactivation to cause postprimary tuberculosis of the lungs PPTBL and then transmit via aerosol to the community In this review, we are exploring recent findings on the role of bone marrow BM stem cell niche in Mtb dormancy and reactivation that may underlie the mechanisms of PPTBL development We suggest that pathogens interaction with the stem cell niche may be relevant in potential inflammation induced PPTBL reactivation, which need significant research attention for the future development of novel preventive and therapeutic strategies for PPTBL, especially in a post COVID19 pandemic world Finally, we put forward potential animal models to study the stem cell basis of Mtb dormancy and reactivation,Severe asthma patients were assumed to be at greater risk of morbidity from infection with the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus COVID19, hence, in the UK, were advised to shield Community data on COVID19 infection in severe asthmatics is lacking We assessed the burden of shielding, the impact of COVID19 and the effect of asthma medication on the UK severe asthma population Adults previously consented to inclusion in the UK Severe Asthma Registry UKSAR across 14 centres were contacted in June 2020 to collect data on potential COVID19 infection, asthma control and shielding Electronic records, where available, were reviewed for confirmation Data was combined with clinical data from the UKSAR Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for COVID19 infection 1365 patients were included 1268 93 were advised to shield, 1131 89 patients who received shielding advice followed it Men OR 04, p0045 and those in nonshielding households OR 027, p0001

equivalent, p0002 Characteristics of severe asthma patients with suspected or confirmed mild ambulatory or severe hospitalised COVID19 infection Hospitalisation and death occurred in small numbers in our severe asthma population From this observational data, biologic agents for asthma were not associated with increased risk of COVID19 infection or hospitalisation,Continuous positive airway pressure noninvasive ventilation CPAP was recommended by NHS England for patients with COVID19 and hypoxaemic respiratory failure either as a ceiling of treatment, trial to avoid intubation or as a bridge to intubation1 However, In the absence of clinical trials, its role in the treatment of COVID19 is poorly understood We collected observational data on outcomes of patients with COVID19 requiring CPAP Data was collected by members of the PRISM trainee research network Patient demographics, comorbidities, Rockwood clinical frailty scale CFS and outcomes death or discharge were collected for patients requiring CPAP for hypoxaemic respiratory failure with confirmed or clinically suspected COVID19 across 6 sites in the South West over 11 weeks from March  June 2020 Data was collected for 164 patients Ages of patients ranged from 30  88 years mean 6213, 110 611 male Most patients received CPAP on a respiratory ward 793 A treatment escalation plan was recorded for 153 85 of patients on admission to hospital Of 100 patients eligible for escalation to intensive care ICU, 50 required intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation IMV despite CPAP therapy CFS scores ranged from 1 to 7 mean 25 Average CFS score those eligible for IMV was 175, compared to 367 for those who were deemed ineligible for IMV Mortality data are shown in table 1 Average length of stay for survivors was 156 days 1  63 The average number of days from admission to death was 86 0  48 Mortality of different patient groups p001 comparing mortality of those who received CPAP as a ceiling of care vs those eligible for IMV In our cohort of patients who received CPAP as a ceiling of treatment mortality was high, especially compared to patients eligible for invasive mechanical ventilation We highlight the need for early treatment escalation decisions, informed discussions with patients and relatives and involvement of palliative care where appropriate These data are potentially limited by variation in practice between sites, and further robust evidence is needed to establish patient selection and timing of CPAP NHS England and NHS Improvement Guidance for the role and use of noninvasive respiratory support in adult patients with COVID19 confirmed or suspected, 6 April 2020, Version 3,BACKGROUND The epidemiology of respiratory virus infections RVI in patients undergoing autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation autoSCT is not well described METHODS Our goal was to describe the epidemiology of respiratory virus infections RVI in patients undergoing autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation autoSCT in a single tertiary centre observation study during two respiratory virus seasons 20152017 All symptomatic autoSCT patients were tested for RVI by nasopharyngeal swab RESULTS 156 transplantation episodes were included, 69 were male and, the median age was 57u2009years We detected 19 RVIs in 156 transplantation episodes 12 The median time to RVI after hospitalization was 13u2009days IQR 713 and 1519 79 had a possible nosocomial origin occurrence  5u2009days after admission The nosocomial infections included 515 33 severe RVIs 3 influenza viruses, 1 parainfluenza virus, and 1 adenovirus as well as 1015 66 nonsevere virus infections including human rhinovirus and human coronavirus CONCLUSION In approximately 10 of autoSCT transplantation episodes, an RVI with likely nosocomial origin was detected and included severe viruses such as influenza Our study suggests that infection prevention measures in autoSCT patients can be improved ABBREVIATIONS AdV adenovirus ALL acute lymphatic leukaemia AML acute myeloid leukaemia autoSCT autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation hCoV human coronavirus HD Hodgkins

lymphoma PIV parainfluenza virus RSV respiratory syncytial virus,Background Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 was originated first in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and it is known to be caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 SARS CoV2 The management of COVID19 could be achieved by means of usage of the repurposed drugs inhibiting the viral entry andor viral fusion such as umifenovir, Baricitinib, Camostat mesylate, Nafamostat mesylate, and the drugs blocking the viral replication which include favipiravir, remdesivir, Lopinavirritonavir, Ribavirin, Sofosbuvir, chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine   Objective Along with the drugs that target the SARSCoV2 virus, adjunctive therapies are also employed This review focuses on the adjuvant therapies employed to manage the COVID19associated complications such as cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS, respiratory failure, cardiac injury, coagulopathy, and multiorgan failure   Method The literature was searched in databases such as MedlinePubMed CentralPubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, EBSCO, Scopus, EMBASE, Directory of open access journals DOAJ, and reference lists to identify relevant articles   Results Various studies have been identified for the use of corticosteroids, interferons, monoclonal antibodies, etoposide, ruxolitinib, anticoagulants, convalescent plasma, immunoglobulins, mesenchymal stem cells, natural killer NK cells, and inhaled nitric oxide NO as adjuvant therapy to manage the patients with COVID19 along with the repurposed drugs targeting SARSCoV2   Conclusion The safety and efficacy of adjuvant therapy are needed to be confirmed by various ongoing randomized controlled clinical trials,An increased risk of pulmonary emboli PE has been reported in COVID19 disease, possibly as a result of a hypercoagulable state Superadded PEs may exacerbate respiratory failure and lead to increased morbidity and mortality The objective of this study was to review the detection rates for PE in patients with COVID19 undergoing CTPA scanning Secondary objectives were to explore correlations between PE diagnosis, serum markers and radiological COVID19 severity A total of 325 patients had a CTPA performed between 3003202015052020 Data was retrospectively collected on patient demographics, COVID19 status, radiological severity British Society of Thoracic Imaging classification, PE location and biochemical markers DDimer, TroponinI, CRP, Ferritin 122325 patients were diagnosed with COVID19 either radiologically n20, 16 or by RTPCR n102, 84 The PE detection rate on imaging was significantly higher in those with COVID19 than those without 32122 26 and 27203 13 respectively p0005 617 patients were hospitalised with COVID19 during this period total PE incidence 52 32617 Radiological severity of COVID19 lung disease was not associated with PE detection p094 Initial quantitative DDimers were significantly higher in COVID19 patients with PE than those without median 4390 range 76120,000 and 930 range 11020,000 respectively p0001 Higher DDimer levels were associated with increased PE detection rates on CT imaging Abstract P253 figure 1 COVID19 associated PEs were more likely to be unilateral 1632 compared to 527 in COVID19 negative group p0025 and trended towards more distal vessels p009 Accounting for age, an additional PE diagnosis did not significantly affect inhospital COVID19 mortality OR 154 CI 052394, p038 a Initial DDimer levels in COVID19 patients without L and with R PE diagnosis on CTPA b Proportion of CTPAs diagnosing a PE at specified DDimer ranges Our results demonstrate increased detection of PE in COVID19 Emboli are more likely to be unilateral, and more distally located We postulate this may be due to higher rates of insitu thrombosis rather than distant embolisation of clots The radiological severity of COVID19 lung disease does not appear to be strongly linked to PE detection rates which may suggest the hypercoagulable state in COVID19 is independent from the inflammatory lung process Patients with COVID19 and coexistent PEs have significantly higher DDimers, and further evaluation is needed into their use as a screening tool,Inhaled ciclesonide CIC, a corticosteroid used to treat asthma that is also being investigated for the treatment of corona virus disease 2019, hydrolyzes to desisobutyrylciclesonide desCIC followed by reversible esterification when exposed to fatty acids in lungs While previous studies have described the distribution and metabolism of the compounds after inhalation, spatial localization in the lungs remains unclear We visualized twodimensional spatial localization of CIC and its metabolites in rat lungs after administration of a single dose of a CIC aerosol with the mass median aerodynamic diameter of 09181168xa0μm using desorption electrospray ionizationtime of flight mass spectrometry imaging DESIMSI In the analysis, CIC, desCIC, and desCIColeate were imaged in frozen lung sections at high spatial and mass resolutions in negativeion mode MSI revealed the coexistence of CIC, desCIC, and desCIColeate on the airway epithelium, and the distribution of desCIC and desCIColeate in peripheral lung regions In addition, a part of CIC independently localized on the airway epithelium These results suggest that distribution of CIC and its metabolites in lungs is related to both the intended delivery of aerosols to pulmonary alveoli and peripheral regions, and the potential deposition of CIC particles on the airway epithelium,Coronavirus disease of 2019 COVID19 has severely affected global health and caused a significant health burden worldwide, particularly in patients with cardiovascular insult Worldwide, the COVID19 confirmed cases number reached 81,658,440 cases with 1,802,206 deaths stated to the world health organization by January 1, 2021 Many risk factors, such as the elderly, diabetes, chronic kidney disease CKD, and cardiovascular illness, like coronary disease, cardiomyopathy, and hypertension put people at high vulnerability with COVID19 infection Many cardiovascular insults directly occur because of COVID19 infection as myocarditis, pericarditis, heart failure, myocardial infarction, thromboembolic events, or arrhythmias This review aims to shed light on different management modalities for COVID19 and discuss the impact of COVID19 on underlying cardiovascular comorbiditiesxa0 Our hope lies in the COVID19 vaccine as the best promising plan against the pandemic with the antiviral medications Till the availability of antiviral agents and effective vaccines, repurposing drugs therapy would continue to be the mainstream Cardiovascular diseases may be caused by or precedent conditions in COVID19 patients The physicians and the medical staff should be uptodate regarding probable complications with COVID19,,,,Although the attention of the world and the global health community specifically is deservedly focused on the COVID19 pandemic, other determinants of health continue to have large impacts and may also interact with COVID19 Air pollution is one crucial example Established evidence from other respiratory viruses and emerging evidence for COVID19 specifically indicates that air pollution alters respiratory defense mechanisms leading to worsened infection severity Air pollution also contributes to comorbidities that are known to worsen outcomes amongst those infected with COVID19, and air pollution may also enhance infection transmission due to its impact on more frequent coughing Yet despite the massive disruption of the COVID19 pandemic, there are reasons for optimism broad societal lockdowns have shown us a glimpse of what a future with strong air pollution measures could yield Thus, the urgency to combat air pollution is not diminished, but instead heightened in the context of the pandemic,The present study describes a patient aged 70 with very highrisk AML who successfully received a nonmyeloablative matched unrelated donor allograft shortly following SARSCoV2 infection, which manifested with mild cough, interstitial abnormalities on chest CT, and pancytopenia with profound bone marrow biopsy histological alterations In parallel, our study provides bone marrow biopsy data in a series of contemporary patients with serious haematological diseases who had a bone marrow biopsy performed within two weeks of PCR confirmation of SARSCoV2 infection This study is notable because there are no published data describing the bone marrow biopsy changes observed in patients with haematological malignancies and SARSCoV2 infection Finally, it is suggested that nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for very highrisk haematological malignancies can be successfully performed following recovery from SARSCoV2 infection,BackgroundObstructive sleep apnea is common among rural Veterans, however, access to diagnostic sleep testing, sleep specialists, and treatment devices is limited To improve access to sleep care, the Veterans Health Administration VA implemented a national sleep telemedicine program The TeleSleep program components included 1 virtual clinical encounters 2 home sleep apnea testing and 3 web application for Veterans and providers to remotely monitor symptoms, sleep quality and use of positive airway pressure PAP therapy This study aimed to identify factors impacting Veterans participation, satisfaction and experience with the TeleSleep program as part of a quality improvement initiativeMethodsSemistructured interview questions elicited patient perspectives and preferences regarding accessing and engaging with TeleSleep care Rapid qualitative and matrix analysis methods for health services research were used to organize and describe the qualitative dataResultsThirty Veterans with obstructive sleep apnea OSA recruited from 6 VA telehealth hubs participated in interviews Veterans reported positive experiences with sleep telemedicine, including improvements in sleep quality, other health conditions, and quality of life Access to care improved as a result of decreased travel burden and ability of both clinicians and Veterans to remotely monitor and track personal sleep data Overall experiences with telehealth technology were positive Veterans indicated a strong preference for VA over nonVA communitybased sleep care Patient recommendations for change included improving scheduling, continuity and timeliness of communication, and the equipment refill processConclusionsThe VA TeleSleep program improved patient experiences across multiple aspects of care including a reduction in travel burden, increased access to clinicians and remote monitoring, and patientreported health and quality of life outcomes, though some communication and continuity challenges remain Implementing telehealth services may also improve the experiences of patients served by other subspecialties or healthcare systems,Fractional exhaled Nitric Oxide FeNO is an essential test for asthma diagnosis in the NICE algorithm NG80 A characteristic feature of asthma is the variability of symptoms and signs Within the setting of our Rapid Access Diagnostics for Asthma RADicA research clinic, we investigated whether repeat testing of FeNO in those with borderline or negative results improved diagnostic certainty Adults and children with symptoms of cough, wheeze, breathlessness or chest tightness were referred by primary care for a comprehensive assessment FeNO NIOX VERO, Circassia was measured on two separate occasions a minimum of 5 days apart prior to starting inhaled corticosteroids FeNO result was classified according to NG80 for adults FeNO  40ppb positive, 2539ppb borderline, 25ppb negative In children 35ppb was positive, 2034ppb was borderline and 20ppb was negative ATS recommendations We compared FeNO between V1 and V2 Intraclass correlation, Wilcoxon signed rank Also we investigated what proportion of those with borderline or negative tests showed a positive results when the test was repeated 112 participants 66 adult, 56 female achieved FeNO on at least one of these visits 86 completed both measures FeNO levels were similar between the two visits V1 median 22ppb IQR 54ppb, V2 median 235ppb IQR 45ppb, p052 r091 p0001 Nine 5 adults of 11 participants with a borderline FeNO at V1 repeated the measure an average of 20 days later One adult and one child were reclassified to positive 22 of the borderline cases Of the 29 adults who were negative at V1, only 2 were positive at V2 none of the 14 children who were negative went on to have a positive test Although there was a strong correlation between FeNO measured on 2 separate occasions prior to starting treatment, almost one in four of those with a borderline test went on to have a positive test when given the opportunity to repeat Repeating FeNO in those with a borderline result would reduce the proportion of patients requiring referral to secondary care, at low cost,BACKGROUND Lingering congestion portends poor outcomes in patients with heart failure HF and is a key target in their management Studies have shown that physical exam has low yield in this setting and conventional methods for more precise assessment and monitoring of volume status eg, body weight, natriuretic peptides, and chest radiography have significant inherent shortcomings SUMMARY Point of care ultrasonography POCUS is a noninvasive versatile bedside diagnostic tool that enhances the sensitivity of conventional physical examination to gauge congestion in these patients It also aids in monitoring the efficacy of decongestive therapy and bears prognostic significance In this narrative review, we discuss the role of focused sonographic assessment of the heart, venous system, and extravascular lung waterascites ie, the pump, pipes, and the leaks in objective assessment of fluid volume status Key Messages Since each of the discussed components of POCUS has its limitations, a combinational ultrasound evaluation guided by the main clinical features would be the key to reliable assessment and effective management of congestion in patients with HF,Since the dawn of medicine, scientists have carefully observed, modeled and interpreted the human body to improve healthcare At the beginning there were drawings and paintings, now there is threedimensional modeling Moving from twodimensional cultures and towards complex and relevant biomaterials, tissueengineering approaches have been developed in order to create threedimensional functional mimics of native organs The bone marrow represents a challenging organ to reproduce because of its structure and composition that confer it unique biochemical and mechanical features to control hematopoiesis Reproducing the human bone marrow niche is instrumental to answer the growing demand for human erythrocytes and platelets for fundamental studies and clinical applications in transfusion medicine In this review, we discuss the latest culture techniques and technological approaches to obtain functional platelets and erythrocytes ex vivo This is a rapidly evolving field that will define the future of targeted therapies for thrombocytopenia and anemia, but also a longterm promise for new approaches to the understanding and cure of hematologic diseases,BACKGROUND As delayed intubation may worsen the outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 patients treated with continuous positive airway pressure CPAP, we sought to determine COVIDspecific early predictors of CPAP failure METHODS In this observational retrospective multicentre study, we included all COVID19 patients treated with outofICU CPAP, candidates for intubation in case of CPAP failure From these patients, we collected demographic and clinical data RESULTS A total of 397 COVID19 patients were treated with CPAP for respiratory failure, with the therapeutic goal of providing intubation in case of CPAP failure Univariable analysis showed that, age, lactate dehydrogenase LDH and white cell counts were all significantly lower in patients with successful CPAP treatment compared to those failing it and undergoing subsequent intubation The percentage changes between baseline and CPAP application in the ratio of partial pressure arterial oxygen PaO2 and fraction of inspired oxygen FiO2, PaO2, respiratory rate and ROX index were higher in patients experiencing successful CPAP compared to those failing it FiO2 and male gender were also significantly associated with intubation Multivariable analysis adjusting for age, gender, Charlson comorbidity index, percentage change in PaO2FiO2 or PaO2 and FiO2 separately, lactate, white blood cell count, LDH and Creactive protein levels led to an area under the curve of 0818 and confirmed that age, LDH and percentage increase in PaO2FiO2 are predictors of intubation CONCLUSIONS In COVID19 patients requiring CPAP, age, LDH and percentage change in PaO2FiO2 after starting CPAP are predictors of intubation,Magnetic resonance MR studies suggested cardiac involvement postCovid19 in a significant subset of affected individuals, including athletes This brings serious clinical concerns regarding the potential need for indepth cardiac screening in athletes after Covid19 before return to play The aim of this study was to gain further insight into the relation between Covid19 and cardiac involvement in professional athletes This was a retrospective cohort study, in which 26 consecutive elite athletes national team, Olympians, top national league players median age 24u2009years, interquartile range IQR 2127, 81 female were included At 15 T including balanced steadystate free precession cine imaging, T1 and T2mapping using Myomaps software Siemens, darkblood T2weighted images with fat suppression, and late gadolinium enhancement LGE with phasesensitive inversion recovery sequence were used The athletes had mainly asymptomatic or mild course of the disease 77 They were scanned after a median of 32u2009days IQR 2262u2009days from the diagnosis MR data were reviewed by three independent observers, each with 10u2009years cardiac MR experience Native T1, T2, extracellular volume, and T2 signal intensity ratio were calculated Diagnosis of acute myocarditis was based on modified Lake Louise criteria Statistical analyses used were Pearson correlation and BlandAltman repeatability analysis At the time of MR the athletes had no pathologic electrocardiogram abnormalities or elevated troponin levels MR did not reveal any case of acute myocarditis Cardiac abnormalities were found in five 19 athletes, including four athletes presenting borderline signs of isolated myocardial edema and one athlete showing nonischemic LGE with pleural and pericardial effusion Another athlete had signs of persistent lung congestion without cardiac involvement We have shown that in a small group of elite athletes with mainly asymptomatic to mild Covid19, lack of electrocardiographic changes, and normal troponin concentration 12 months after the diagnosis, there were no signs of acute myocarditis, but 19 of athletes had some abnormalities as assessed by cardiac MR LEVEL OF EVIDENCE 4 TECHNICAL EFFICACY STAGE 3,Since December 2019, the clinical symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 and its complications are evolving As the number of COVID patients requiring positive pressure ventilation is increasing, so is the incidence of subcutaneous emphysema SE We report 10 patients of COVID19, with SE and pneumomediastinum The mean age of the patients was 59  8 years range, 2375 Majority of them were men 80, and common symptoms were dyspnoea 100, fever 80 and cough 80 None of them had any underlying lung disorder All patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome on admission, with a median PaO2FiO2 ratio of 1225 Eight out of ten patients had spontaneous pneumomediastinum on their initial chest xray in the emergency department The median duration of assisted ventilation before the development of SE was 55 days interquartile range, 510 days The highest positive endexpiratory pressure PEEP was 10 cmH2O for patients recieving invasive mechanical ventilation, while 8 cmH2O was the average PEEP in patients who had developed subcutaneous emphysema on noninvasive ventilation All patients received corticosteroids while six also received tocilizumab, and seven received convalescent plasma therapy, respectively Seven patients died during their hospital stay All patients either survivor or nonsurvivor had prolonged hospital stay with an average of 14 days range 825 days Our findings suggest that it is lung damage secondary to inflammatory response due to COVID19 triggered by the use of positive pressure ventilation which resulted in this complication We conclude that the development of spontaneous pneumomediastinum and SE whenever present, is associated with poor outcome in critically ill COVID19 ARDS patients,BackgroundThere are limited data on Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 in solid organ transplant patients, especially in heart transplant recipients, with only a few case reports and case series described so far Heart transplant recipients may be at particular high risk due to their comorbidities and immunosuppressed stateCase presentationThis report describes the clinical course and the challenging management of early COVID19 infection in two heart transplant recipients who tested positive for the SARSCoV2 virus in the perioperative period of the transplant procedure The two patients developed a severe form of the disease and ultimately died despite the initiation of an antiviral monotherapy with hydroxychloroquine coupled with the interruption of mycophenolate mofetilConclusionsThese two cases illustrate the severity and poor prognosis of COVID19 in the perioperative period of a heart transplant Thorough screening of donors and recipients is mandatory, and the issue of asymptomatic carriers needs to be addressed,The spread of the coronavirus SARSCoV2, COVID19 for short has caused a large number of deaths around the world We summarized the data reported in the past few months and emphasized that the main causes of death of COVID19 patients are DAD Diffuse Alveolar Damage and DIC Disseminated intravascular coagulation Microthrombosis is a prominent clinical feature of COVID19, and 913 of dead patients had microthrombosisEndothelial damage caused by SARSCoV2 cell invasion and subsequent host response disorders involving inflammation and coagulation pathways play a key role in the progression of severe COVID19 Microvascular thrombosis may lead to microcirculation disorders and multiple organ failure lead to deathThe characteristic pathological changes of DAD include alveolar epithelial and vascular endothelial injury, increased alveolar membrane permeability, large numbers of neutrophil infiltration, alveolar hyaline membrane formation, and hypoxemia and respiratory distress as the main clinical manifestations DAD leads to ARDS in COVID19 patients DIC is a syndrome characterized by the activation of systemic intravascular coagulation, which leads to extensive fibrin deposition in the blood Its occurrence and development begin with the expression of tissue factor and interact with physiological anticoagulation pathways The downregulation of fibrin and the impaired fibrinolysis together lead to extensive fibrin depositionDIC is described as a decrease in the number of platelets and an increase in fibrin degradation products, such as Ddimer and low fibrinogen The formation of microthrombus leads to the disturbance of microcirculation, which in turn leads to the death of the patient However, the best prevention and treatment of COVID19 microthrombosis is still uncertainThis review discusses the latest findings of basic and clinical research on COVID19related microthrombosis, and then we proposed the theory of microcirculation perfusion bundle therapy to explore effective methods for preventing and treating COVID19related microthrombosis Further research is urgently needed to clarify how SARSCoV2 infection causes thrombotic complications, and how it affects the course and severity of the disease To cultivate a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanism of this disease Raise awareness of the importance of preventing and treating microthrombosis in patients with COVID19,The COVID19 pandemic led to rapid global spread with farreaching impacts on healthcare systems Whilst pediatric data consistently shown a milder disease course, chronic lung disease has been identified as a risk factor for hospitalization and severe disease In Africa, comprised predominantly of low middleincome countries LMIC, the additional burden of HIV, tuberculosis, malnutrition and overcrowding is high and further impacts health risk This paper reviewed the literature on COVID19 and chronic lung disease in children and provides our experience from an African pediatric pulmonary center in Cape Town, South Africa South African epidemiological data confirms a low burden of severe disease with children 18 years comprising 8 of all diagnosed cases and 3 of all COVID19 admissions A decrease in hospital admission for other viral lower respiratory tract infections was found While the pulmonology service manages children with a wide range of chronic respiratory conditions including bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, asthma, interstitial lung disease and children with tracheostomies, no significant increase in COVID19 admissions were noted and in those who developed COVID19, the disease course was not severe Current evidence suggests that preexisting respiratory disease in children does not appear to be a significant risk factor for severe COVID19 Longitudinal data are still needed to assess risk in children with immunosuppression and interstitial lung diseases The indirect impacts of the pandemic response on child respiratory health are notable and still likely to be fully realized and quantified Ensuring children have access to full preventive and care services during this time is priority,Asthma is a common, chronic inflammatory airway disease, characterised by unpredictable episodes of worsening symptoms, or exacerbations Causes of asthma exacerbations include viral infections, exposure to allergen and air pollution, all of which increase the underlying inflammation that typifies asthma Most 5075 patients are classed as having mild asthma, with symptoms that can be readily controlled with available inhaled medications Paradoxically, for the past 30xa0years, the first treatment recommended in asthma management guidelines was shortacting β2agonists SABA, which not only have no antiinflammatory properties but may, in fact, worsen inflammation The Global Initiative for Asthma GINA 20192020 broke with this paradox by stating clearly that SABA should no longer be used alone as a reliever, for safety reasons Instead, GINA now recommends an antiinflammatory rescuereliever approach for adult and adolescent patients, based on the combination of an inhaled corticosteroid with a rapid onset β2agonist such as formoterol This commentary highlights the fact that even patients with wellcontrolled mild asthma are at risk of severe, potentially lifethreatening exacerbations, similar to those in patients with moderate or severe asthma, and therefore mild asthma, is a misnomer The commentary describes the case history of a patient with mild asthma to illustrate how increasing use of SABA alone can worsen and prolong exacerbations when they occur The author goes on to describe how the management of this patients exacerbation could have been improved, and provides uptodate advice on broader aspects of the management of mild asthma and exacerbations, supported by the recent changes to the GINA recommendations,BACKGROUND Recent studies suggested that patients with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 who use reninangiotensin system RAS inhibitors have an increased risk of respiratory failure and death The hypothesis was that angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor ACEIs or angiotensin receptor blocker ARBs may upregulate ACE2 expression that is used as receptor for viral entry into cells OBJECTIVE The purpose of this review is to discuss the existing evidence on the interaction between COVID19 infection, ACE2 and ACEIs or ARBs and to examine the main implications for clinical practice In addition, novel therapeutic strategies for blocking ACE2mediated COVID19 infection will be displayed METHODS We performed a comprehensive review of the literature to identify data from clinical and experimental studies for the association between COVID19 infection, ACE2 and RAS inhibition RESULTS The current clinical and experimental evidence for ACEIs or ARBs to facilitate severe acute respiratory distress syndromecoronavirus2 SARSCoV2 is insufficient to suggest discontinuing these drugs Several observational studies arrive at the conclusion that the continued use of RAS inhibitors is unlike to be harmful in COVID19positive patients CONCLUSIONS Further randomized trials are needed to answer definitely the question of whether RAS inhibitors are harmful or beneficial to patients with COVID19,We sought to improve the care of patients who presented with asthma exacerbations based on recommendations from the National Review of Asthma Deaths NRAD and the British Thoracic Society BTS asthma bundle We developed a specialist nurseled service to followup patients with exacerbations of asthma within 48 hours of discharge from the emergency department ED We also digitalised the asthma proforma used for assessment of patients by the respiratory specialist nurse team We evaluated these changes by collecting data on the proformas and discharge letters completed during followup and compared them with the results of an ED audit to determine whether the appointments were better addressing the BTS recommendations We also compared the updated proformas with previous proformas and recorded the information subsequently relayed to primary care We identified 63 patients who were referred for outpatient followup between January  June 2019, which 5563 87 attended There was a statistically significant increase in the number of patients having the BTS recommendations addressed compared to the 2015 ED audit where comparable data was available Table 1 Comparison of the old assessment proformas with their subsequent discharge letters showed that salient information was often not relayed to primary care eg smoking status confirmed in 100 of proformas but only available in 42 of discharge letters Initial testing of the digitalised proformas showed that more recommendations were addressed and relayed to primary care Where comparable data were available they were analysed with Chi squared test for independence Specialist nurseled asthma followup appointments have improved the quality of care we provide to our asthma patients Both the number of patients who receive followup after an asthma exacerbation and the quality of their assessment have improved in line with BTS recommendations We hope that ongoing work on the assessment proformas will further increase our adherence to these recommendations and improve communication with primary care,To assess the impact of virtual consultant review of COPD patients referred to pulmonary rehabilitation PR, with reference to lung volume reduction suitability LVR NICE recommends that COPD patients that have completed PR, but continue to experience breathlessness affecting quality of life and meet certain criteria should be considered for LVR1 However, whose responsibility this should be is not clear2 Notes and imaging

is a multidrug resistant, Gramnegative bacillus that can cause opportunistic respiratory infections and is recognized as a pathogen in cystic fibrosis CF Previous reports of the epidemiological trends and antimicrobial resistance of respiratory S maltophilia infections are limited in size The aims of this study were 1 to determine the demographics, persistence, prevalence and cotrimoxazole susceptibility of respiratory S maltophilia infection over a fiveyear period and 2 to identify specific risk factors for S maltophilia infection in people with CF All respiratory samples culturepositive for S maltophilia at our institution between December 2014 and December 2019 were identified Clinical data were extracted from patients electronic health records 740 S  maltophilia isolates from 238 patients were identified with median age 62 years range 096 Respiratory S maltophilia infection was most commonly associated with invasive ventilation 298, CF 256 and nonCF bronchiectasis 244 There was no clear change in the rate of S maltophilia infection during the study mean 153 positive samplesyear107 of isolates were cotrimoxazole resistant, with resistance more common in CF than other diagnoses 295 vs 53, p0001 There were higher rates of chronic infection, as per the adapted Leeds Criteria, in patients with CF compared to nonCF diagnoses 197 vs 99, p0069 In the year prior to their 2018 annual review, S maltophiliapositive CF patients received more intravenous IV antibiotic days than S maltophilianegative CF patients median 32 vs 7, p0026 S maltophiliapositive CF patients had a higher rate of chronic Methicillinsensitive Staphylococcus aureus than S maltophilianegative CF patients 560 vs 306, p0032 Rates of pulmonary S maltophilia infection do not appear to be increasing over a fiveyear period at our institution S maltophilia infection is most commonly associated with invasive ventilation, CF and bronchiectasis We found evidence of a heightened susceptibility of CF patients to develop chronic infection and carry cotrimoxazole resistant S maltophilia isolates, compared to other patient groups Risk factors for infection in CF patients included IV antibiotic use and chronic MSSA infection,Severe asthma with fungal sensitisation SAFS is a complex clinical phenotype associated with poorlycontrolled T2 inflammation and significant morbidity from both the disease itself and a high steroid burden There are limited data on the effectiveness of biologic therapies targeting the IL5eosinophil pathway in this patient group We assessed the realworld effectiveness of treatment with mepolizumab or benralizumab in patients with SAFS and compared the outcomes with severe atopic asthmatics without fungal sensitisation SAA and severe nonatopic asthmatics SNA Baseline clinical characteristics and clinical outcomes at 48weeks were evaluated A subgroup analysis was performed of SAFS patients who met criteria for serological ABPA 193 patients treated with mepolizumab n63 or benralizumab n130 were analysed 42 patients were defined as SAFS, 99 as SAA and 52 as SNA Patients with SAFS had a higher baseline IgE compared to patients with SAA and SNA mean  standard deviation 11351563 IUml vs 343530 and 142171, respectively both p00001 No differences in baseline eosinophil count, FeNO, lung function, ACQ6 score, maintenance oral corticosteroid mOCS dose or exacerbation frequency were observed between groups There were significant improvements in ACQ6, exacerbation frequency and reduction in mOCS dose across all groups No significant between group differences in outcomes were observed at 48 weeks Patients with ABPA n10 had a significant reduction in exacerbation frequency p0005 and trend towards reduction in mOCS dose at 1year p006 Patients with SAFS demonstrated similar improvements in clinical outcomes to severe eosinophilic patients without fungal sensitisation A subgroup of patients with ABPA demonstrated reduction in exacerbation frequency These data highlight the clinical effectiveness of targeting eosinophilic inflammation in SAFS and ABPA,Hospitalised exacerbations of COPD lead to significant morbidity and mortality Unlike most other common conditions treated in hospital eg pulmonary embolism and myocardial infarction, international guidelines do not define clinical characteristics, tests and outcomes to be assessed at time of follow up We sought to evaluate the current Europewide expert view on demographic, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, investigations, and clinical outcomes to be assessed at follow up after a hospitalised exacerbation of COPD A modified online Delphi survey of COPD experts was performed 3 iterative rounds were undertaken Importance and feasibility of items were assessed Consensus and stability criteria were predefined 25 COPD experts from 18 European countries completed all 3 rounds of the Delphi survey Of the 31 clinical signs assessed, 13 42 clinical signs achieved consensus as important to capture at time of follow up after hospitalised exacerbation of COPD Similarly, only five clinical scores and questionnaires were thought to be important to capture at time of follow up after hospitalisation These were the modified Medical Research Council mMRC dyspnoea index, COPD Assessment Test CAT, the BODE index BMI, Obstruction, Dyspnoea and Exercise Capacity, the Global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease GOLD IIV and AD classifications Experts agreed by consensus that they would consider most of the scores at time of follow up but would not suggest including them routinely Tests at time of follow up after hospitalisation for exacerbation of COPD Hospitalised exacerbations of COPD are managed and followed up differently throughout Europe Standardisation will help guide research to improve outcomes,Posttuberculous lung disease contributes to morbidity in pulmonary tuberculosis PTB survivors However, the determinants of persistent lung damage are not well established and may relate to sociodemographic factors, bacterial burden, delayed presentation to healthcare or host immune responses especially neutrophils, implicated in bronchiectasis pathogenesis and cavitation We investigated associations between radiological posttuberculous lung disease and these potential predictors We collected data from patients treated for PTB at our centre over a 55 year period excluding those with HIV infection, other known immunodeficiencies or immunosuppressive medication, preexisting structural lung disease, drug resistant infection or with disease sites not including lungs or pleura We recorded age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, duration of symptoms, sputum smear acid fast bacilli grade, time to culture positivity and blood results Creactive protein and neutrophil count at baseline and at 1 month Chest xrays performed at baseline, 2 months and end of treatment at a median of 195 days from treatment initiation were assessed by two radiologists independently and scored using a validated system Relationships between predictor variables and radiological outcomes were assessed using linear or binary logistic regression as appropriate We assessed 156 individuals, mean age 37 years, 62 male Baseline and 2month radiological severity correlated with age, ethnicity higher scores in white patients, grade of sputum smear positivity and blood inflammatory markers and inversely with time to culture positivity In multivariate analysis only sputum smear grade p0001 and neutrophil count p0001 retained significance At end of treatment, only the 1month neutrophil count not baseline neutrophil count was significantly associated with overall radiological severity r032, p0005 in multivariate analysis The 1month neutrophil count was also the only independent correlate of volume loss odds ratio OR125 per 1 × 109 increase in neutrophils, p004 and pleural thickening OR123, p004 1month neutrophil counts were higher in patients with persistent cavitation or effusion at end of treatment compared to those without Persistent neutrophilic inflammation after 1 month of anti tuberculosis therapy is associated with poor radiological outcome, suggesting both a target for interventions to minimise posttuberculous lung disease and a means to identify people at greatest risk,Apparent diffusion coefficient ADC and mean diffusive length scale LmD are diffusionweighted DW MRI measurements of alveolar gas diffusion, providing novel lung microstructure information Hyperpolarised 129xenon 129Xe MR spectroscopy is a quantitative marker of gas exchange, using the ratio of uptake of 129Xe in red blood cells to tissueplasma RBCTP The objective was to evaluate hyperpolarised 129Xe MRI in differentiating between fibrotic and inflammatory ILD and assessing longitudinal change A prospective, multicentre study of ILD patients including connective tissue disease ILD CTDILD, drug induced ILD DIILD, hypersensitivity pneumonitis HP, idiopathic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia iNSIP and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis IPF Hyperpolarised 129Xe MRI was performed on a 15T scanner Baseline HRCT scan was performed within a year prior to the MRI scan Semiquantitative visual CT analysis was performed by two consultant chest radiologists In the nonIPF subtypes, a ground glass opacity score 2 and 2 was used to define fibrotic and inflammatory ILD respectively All IPF subjects were classified as fibrotic To date, 34 patients 5 CTDILD, 9 DIILD, 7 HP, 2 iNSIP, 11 IPF have complete MRI scan data for two separate visits 6 weeks apart for DIILDHPiNSIP and 6 months apart for CTDILDIPF There were 18 patients in the fibrotic group and 16 in the inflammatory group At baseline visit there was no significant difference in mean RBCTP between the fibrotic and inflammatory groups 017 vs 014 p0083, but a significant difference between the fibrotic and inflammatory groups in mean ADC 0048 vs 0043 p0030 figure 1a and mean LmD2613 vs 2434 p0017 figure 1b In longitudinal change, there was a significant difference in mean RBCTP between the fibrotic and inflammatory groups 0026 vs 00016 p0023, but no significant difference between the fibrotic and inflammatory groups in mean ADC 000089 vs 000025 p025 and mean LmD 21 vs 019 p039 Difference between the fibrotic and inflammatory groups in mean 129Xe ADC a and LmD b at baseline study visit 129Xe DWMRI could have a role in differentiating changes in the airway microstructure between fibrotic and inflammatory ILD 129Xe RBCTP has sensitivity to longitudinal change with a decline in gas exchange observed in the fibrotic group but not in the inflammatory group,Oximetry is a widely used, but insensitive, screening test for obstructive sleep apnoea OSA Patients with nondiagnostic oximetry may be referred for a trial of continuous positive airway pressure CPAP based on symptoms of OSA due to lack of availability of polysomnography We assessed the efficacy of CPAP in these patients compared to those with confirmed OSA We retrospectively reviewed 54 patients referred for a CPAP trial between January and June 2018 34 patients were selected with a 4 oxygen desaturation index ODI 5hour low ODI group and compared to 20 patients with a 4 ODI 15hour high ODI group Baseline demographics and follow up data on CPAP adherence and symptoms was collected Patients with a lower ODI were younger 440116 vs 555142 years, p005 and had a lower BMI 29244 vs 38594, p005 than those with a higher ODI Prevalence of snoring was higher in the low ODI group 971 vs 80, p005 Excessive daytime somnolence 971 vs 90, p027, partnerreported apnoeas 676 vs 90, p006 and Epworth scores 13347 vs 12758, p064 were similar At initial follow up median 87 days in low ODI group vs 56 days in high ODI group, 589 patients in the low ODI group continued to use CPAP vs 95 in the high ODI group, p009 figure 1 The low ODI patients used CPAP less than the high ODI patients average usage 34320 vs 632208 hoursnight, p005 Fewer patients reported symptomatic improvement in the low ODI group 50 vs 75, p007 and their Epworth scores tended to be higher 11248 vs 7466, p006 At final follow up median 383 days in the low ODI vs 286 days in the high ODI group, 323 of the low ODI patients were still using CPAP vs 75 of the high ODI patients p005 Clinical outcomes of 54 patients referred for CPAP trialCPAP continuous positive airway pressure, DNA did not attend, MAD mandibular advancement device, PSG polysomnography Although some patients with unconfirmed OSA benefit from CPAP, they are less likely to use it than those with confirmed OSA Performing a polysomnogram following nondiagnostic oximetry may prevent unnecessary CPAP trials,Fitness testing forms an important role in evaluating an individuals athletic performance and potential Its assessment is a complex, multifaceted process comprising of cardiovascular endurance, strength, and flexibility testing as well as body composition evaluation The respiratory element of this is commonly overlooked and undervalued despite dyspnoea, upper airway distress, recurrent infections and coryzal symptoms being a notable cause of underperformance in athletes Previous studies have postulated that airway hyperresponsiveness or repeated injury and repair process of the respiratory epithelium, can lead to structural and functional changes, and are then responsible for the underlying airway dysfunction in athletes It therefore seems feasible that understanding this could allow management and subsequent improved athletic performance To examine the prevalence of airways disease in athletes attending a dedicated sports cardiology service To evaluate the correlation between respiratory physiology and exercise performance Over 12 months the data of 82 athletes, comprising of team sports and individual endurance athletes, attending a dedicated sports cardiology service were retrospectively evaluated including clinical history, baseline spirometry and cardiopulmonary exercise test CPET FeNO and spirometry with reversibility were performed in individuals with respiratory symptoms or abnormal baseline spirometry 1482 17 had abnormal baseline spirometry defined by lower limit of normal, of which 614 had significant reversibility and 414 had FeNO 40ppb A further 682 73 had FeNO 40ppb with normal baseline spirometry 243 of the athletes had pulmonary function testing highly suggestive or diagnostic of airways dysfunction 1382 159 were commenced on inhaled therapy based on the results of these investigations Using a Welchs ttest to analyse the data there was a statistically significant difference between FEV1, FEV1FVC ratio and breathing reserve for those with normal versus abnormal investigations These results demonstrate airway disease is highly prevalent in an athletic population Results suggest that premature encroachment on ventilatory reserves may negatively affect performance in high achieving athletes Addressing this could potentially have a positive influence on performance A prospective study to further evaluate the prevalence of airways disease and impact on performance is underway,There is no ideal way to diagnose and monitor asthma in children and there is an urgent need for noninvasive biomarkers1 A growing body of research suggests that volatile organic compounds VOCs in breath may have a role in diagnosing and monitoring asthma The ReCIVA Owlstone Medical Limited is a breath sampler designed to standardise the collection of breath samples for the offline analysis of VOCs However, its utility for paediatric sampling has not yet been fully established To discover whether the ReCIVA is effective at collecting breath samples from paediatric asthma patients We collected ReCIVA samples from 64 children aged 515 years with acute and stable asthma and healthy controls The ReCIVA is a handheld device consisting of a face mask, pressure and CO2 sensors, and sorbent tubes which sit above two pumps As mask pressure changes with the breath cycle the pumps are activated, with the aim of collecting the endtidal breath portion onto sorbent tubes We evaluated the metadata to assess the validity and effectiveness of paediatric sampling using the ReCIVA This included exploring pump activation alignment with the phase of breath, exhaled breath volume sampled, sample collection time and recorded errors in relation to two ReCIVA serial numbers, 42 and 53 Of 90 samples, 70 778 reached the 1L target breath volume collection Similar sample characteristics were found between asthmatics and controls table 21 233 samples had recorded errors, the most common being a leak detected error Discrepancies were found in the timing of pump activation which appeared to be random Differences occurred between the two ReCIVA serial number sample characteristics Two samples were aborted, and one sample had almost no breath sampled despite a full collection time ReCIVA sample characteristics for the three patient groups, excluding the two aborted samples and one sample with almost no volume sampled despite a full collection time Overall, the results indicate that the ReCIVA is a viable option for standardised breath sampling in the paediatric population Exploration of pump activation misalignments with the phase of breath is required to determine the reasons behind this Further work is also needed to investigate whether a wider range of mask sizes improves the leak detected error rate Breathe 2019151e207,Cardiopulmonary exercise testing CPET is a powerful diagnostic tool for investigating unexplained breathlessness As well as diagnosing pathology, excluding harmful causes can reassure patients and help clinicians avoid overinvestigation Since 2013, Nevill Hall Hospital has offered CPET as the first line test for unexplained breathlessness if a diagnosis remains unclear after history, examination and basic clinic testing figure 1 We have followed the cohort of 46 patients tested in 2013 to assess the impact of a negative CPET on future secondary care use and the frequency of missed pathology We retrospectively reviewed the electronic case records of all 46 patients to 31st December 2019 We collected CPET outcomes, duration of follow up, number of subsequent referrals back to secondary care for breathlessness and the number and results of subsequent specialist investigations We examined all secondary care correspondence for subsequent diagnoses of cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, even if breathlessness was not the presenting complaint 90 4146 of CPETs showed no evidence of harmful pathology Of these, just over half 2441 showed positive evidence of dysfunctional breathing and a quarter 1241 of deconditioning 90 3741 were discharged within one appointment Onethird 1341 were later either referred back to secondary care 841, frequented acute medical services 341 or accessed further specialist testing through secondary care 941 for the same complaint of breathlessness Only one rereferral led to a new diagnosis of COPD, six years after CPET and of 29 additional investigations for the nine patients who underwent repeat testing, no additional diagnoses were found 4 241 were later diagnosed with a pathology potentially missed by their CPET One patient had a paroxysmal arrhythmia, not present at time of CPET The second presented four months after CPET with myocardial infarction their dysfunctional breathing pattern was so pronounced at CPET that they couldnt reach adequate levels of exercise to reveal ischaemia Investigating unexplained breathlessness pathway Nevill Hall Hospital 6 weeks of symptom and 5 weeks since acute chest infection This study provides support for use of CPET to reliably exclude harmful pathology and reassure both patients and clinicians early within a secondary care pathway for unexplained breathlessness The diagnostic limitations of a submaximal test must be appreciated,Newer proton MRI methods may be complementary to conventional respiratory diagnostics like computed tomography CT and spirometry Noncontrast Ultrashort Echo Time UTE MRI acquires high resolution structural images, comparable to CT, and gradientecho combined with phaseresolved functional lung PREFUL processing methods can produce spatial assessments of lung function The need for such MRI methods is exemplified by cystic fibrosis CF, where rapid development of novel therapeutics demands an equivalent change in our ability to monitor lung disease To evaluate lung structure and function using UTE and PREFUL MRI methods in people with CF with at least one F508del mutation preTrikafta therapy 5 people with CF 1221 years n4 homozygous F508del n3 on Symkevi underwent a single MRI scanning session performed on a 3T Philips Ingenia scanner UTEMRI was collected during a 10second breathhold n2 or free breathing with a respiratorygated acquisition n3 PREFULMRI was performed using a continuous single coronal slice Fast Field Echo acquisition during 2 minutes of free breathing n5 PREFUL analysis was performed using a semiautomated kmeans segmentation algorithm in MATLAB 1 A region of interest ROI at the diaphragm was defined, images with extremes of signal intensity were removed and those remaining sorted into a sinusoidal pattern of signal intensity within the ROI Thoracic masking and a pulmonary vessel filter were applied followed by kmeans clustering analysis to demonstrate normal ventilation and ventilation defect Ventilation defect percentage VDP was calculated by dividing the ventilation defect volume by the lung mask volume MRI scanning was welltolerated and both UTE and PREFUL acquisitions were completed in all participants VDP values ranged from 8093665, with the individual with the lowest FEV1 having the highest VDP figure 1 UTE left and PREFUL right images from five people with CF PREFUL MRI shows areas of normal ventilation green and ventilation defect purple Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of combined structural and functional lung MRI assessment in people with CF These noncontrast approaches do not require additional specialised equipment, such as hyperpolarised gas, and could be obtained using standard clinical MRI scanners In the future, functional lung MRI may facilitate longitudinal assessment of response to disease modifying therapies, such as CFTR modulators Couch, et al Academic Radiology 2020 doi101016jacra202005008,Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis EGPA is a rare, ANCAassociated vasculitis characterised by asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis and blood eosinophilia which may be accompanied by neurological, cardiac, cutaneous and renal involvement Interleukin5 IL5 is a key cytokine implicated in eosinophil survival We present our experience with benralizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody that interferes with the IL5 receptor alpha IL5Rα, and its effect on patientreported outcomes and oral corticosteroid OCS

requirements and improved measures of disease control following benralizumab therapy in patients with EGPA Further research exploring the mechanisms of residual disease in eosinopaenic patients is needed and will compliment upcoming prospective controlled trials of this therapy in EGPA,PreCOVID19, the total number of passengers traveling by commercial airlines rose to 43 billion, with Europe amounting to a 72 increase The risks of respiratory compromised patients developing hypoxaemia during flight is well documented Assessment of these patients is time consuming and often requires specialised equipment Furthermore, the majority of evidence is based on research into patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease COPD The aim of this study is to investigate potential predictive biomarkers relating to the development of hypoxaemia during flight in patients with Motor Neurone Disease MND 118 MND patients referred into a fitness to fly service n118 completed baseline lung function and a Hypoxic Challenge Test HCT as part of a risk stratification for planned air travel 77 male Data from patients requiring inflight oxygen was compared to patients who did not, in accordance with the British Thoracic Society recommendations 2011 Managing passengers with stable respiratory disease planning air travel Statistical analysis was performed using oneway ANOVA, KruskalWallis, and ChiSquared tests, as appropriate There was no significant difference between the pass n94 and fail n24 groups for age, gender, smoking history or BMI There was a significant difference for all spirometry data FEV1, FVC and FEV1FVC ratio  absolute, percent predicted and standardised residuals Moreover, the resting blood gases FiO221 data showed significant difference for all parameters with the exception of pH 0001 The Regression analysis showed limited predictive value of spirometry andor resting blood gas data with the exception of PaCO2 and base excess BE Descriptive statistics for physiological parameters by condition, including indications of statistical significance The predictive value of spirometic paraments and resting blood gases are limited in assessing hypoxaemia during commercial flight in MND patients, with the exception of parameters relating to respiratory failure Despite the significant difference between the two groups, routine physiological data was limited in the predictive regression equations We recommend that the safest approach in managing this group of patients is to perform an HCT in all patients intending to use air travel until more evidencebased data is available,Pulmonary Embolism PE is associated with a notable risk of morbidity and mortality CT pulmonary angiograms CTPA are used in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and also to determine the clot burden and right ventricular strain University Hospital of North Midlands UHNM PE score is a radiological score created to optimize risk analysis haemodynamic instability of patients with large PE using radiological features The score assesses location of clot L in major pulmonary arteries scores 1, 2 and 4, the degree of occlusion o score 1,2 and 3 and the impact on the right ventricle RVR scores 1,2 and 3 Interventricular septum morphology S is also assessed scores 1, 2, 3 and 4 Multipliers are used to obtain the total score, L × O × RVR  S Maximum score is 64 This score is correlated with clinical outcome The PE severity is classified into mild 19, moderate 1014 and severe 15 Figure 1 A retrospective analysis of CTPAs From 132014 till 1072018 was performed A total of 485 patients, whose CTPA showed Large PESaddle embolism, were included in study All CTPAs showing segmentalsubsegmental PEs and CTPAs with poor quality imaging were excluded SPESI was calculated retrospectively using clinical notes Out of 485 patients, 99 patients had SPESI score of 0 204, these patients had average UHNM PE score of 9 and their average inpatient hospital stay was 5 days 5 patients out of 99 ended up in having thrombolysis, 7 had inpatient cardiothoracic referral for surgical intervention 3 patients out of 99 died in 30day period UHNM PE score has comparable performance in identifying the risk of haemodynamic compromise in large PE It improves the specificity by risk stratifying large PEs into 3 groups, hence can be utilized in clinical decision making regarding appropriate treatment and predicting clinical outcomes Further studies are needed to validate its utility before its universal application,Mepolizumab and benralizumab target the IL5eosinophil pathway and are highly effective therapies for severe eosinophilic asthma SEA Fractional exhaled nitric oxide FeNO is a marker of IL13 and elevated baseline levels are associated with an improved response to the antiIL4R mAb dupilumab However, FeNO was not measured in the phase 3 program for either mepolizumab or benralizumab and so it is unclear whether this same relationship exists for these therapies as well We performed a retrospective analysis of adult patients with SEA who had received Mepolizumab and Benralizumab at our tertiary severe asthma centre Clinical characteristics including asthma control ACQ6, annualised exacerbation rate AER, maintenance OCS mOCS requirements and T2 biomarkers were recorded at baseline and at regular intervals throughout the first year of treatment Patients were stratified into quartiles according to their baseline FeNO and the clinical effectiveness of mepolizumab and benralizumab compared between FeNO groups 229 patients 99 mepolizumab, 130 benralizumab were included in the analysis Stratifying the cohort according to baseline FeNO produced quartile ranges of 26, 2643, 4474 and 74 With the exception of FeNO there was no difference in baseline characteristics between the FeNO groups Both mepolizumab and benralizumab significantly improved all clinical outcome measures of interest, however, the degree of clinical response did not appear to differ between the FeNO groups figure 1 Following initiation of antiIL55R treatment, numerically large and statistically significant reductions in FeNO level was seen in only the highest FeNO quartile Q4 baseline median FeNO 96ppb IQR 85136ppb, 1 year median 645ppb IQR 37107, p 0001 Although FeNO is a biomarker of IL13 biology, we highlight that high FeNO is associated with an excellent response to antiIL55R therapies in a realworld setting This calls into question the unproven notion that severe eosinophilic patients with high baseline FeNO may derive superior outcomes with dupilumab as compared to mepolizumab or benralizumab,There remains a paucity of data comparing ambulatory initiation of home noninvasive ventilation NIV with a model requiring inpatient admission1 In our institution, a Quality Improvement QI project was performed where an ambulatory model for NIV initiation was developed and evaluated Ambulatory pathways were formulated for NIV initiation in the outpatient setting, alongside outreach and initiation of NIV for inpatients referred within regional hospitals The primary outcome measure was compliance with NIV defined as NIV use 4 hoursnight for 75 of nights2 Between 6120 and 1720, 76 referrals for home NIV were assessed within the ambulatory model Of these, NIV was not indicated in 3 cases and contraindicated in 1 case, while 2 trialled NIV and declined it, leaving 70 patients who commenced home NIV n36 following COVID19 ward closure Neuromuscular disease was the principal diagnosis in 41 2970 with MND comprising 2029 neuromuscular cases see table 1 Ventilator interaction data was available for 68 patients where mean NIV use was 521 SD 398 hoursnight Of those established by ambulatory pathway, 62 4268 were deemed compliant with NIV in comparison to previous data reporting compliance in 62 5690 of subjects established through inpatient admission2 It was calculated that delivery of the ambulatory pathway

prescribed for urinary tract infections UTIs Associated adverse pulmonary and hepatic sideeffects are known Current monitoring guidelines1 2 lack specific recommendations for monitoring This work formed part of a clinical effectiveness project to raise awareness of side effects of prophylactic NF and allow recommendations for monitoring We undertook 1 Audit 1st31st July 2020 of GP surgeries in local clinical commissioning group CCG who prescribed prophylactic NF and assessed their monitoring habits 2 Assessment of GPs and urologists prescribing habits and awareness of complications associated with prophylactic NF 3 Audit of patients diagnosed with nitrofurantoininduced interstitial lung disease NFILD by our ILD center 20142020 503 patients in local CCG were prescribed prophylactic NF at time of audit 265503 were on prophylaxis for 02 years, 40 of these for 6 months to 2 years Of those patients on NF 6 months to 2 years, 45 received no monitoring, 21 received both lung and liver monitoring, 20 received only liver monitoring and 14 received only lung 238503 patients were on prophylaxis for 2 years in this cohort 20 received no monitoring, 44 received both lung and liver monitoring, 21 received only liver monitoring and 15 received only lung Of 125 questionnaire respondents prescribing prophylactic NF, 82 were GPs and 12 urologists 47 followed CCG guidelines whilst 38 followed national guidelines 58 were aware of liver complications and 72 aware of respiratory However, 41 and 53 were never monitored for liver and lung complications respectively Our centre diagnosed 46 patients with NIILD 804 were female, mean age 72 years 70 were prescribed NF for recurrent UTIs and 587 were prescribed for 6 months Of this cohort, 61 displayed resolution completewith minimal fibrosis on HRCT following removal of NF, 16 developed fibrosis and 23 showed no interval change There was no difference in subset analysis of those treated with steroids from those not NF complications can bear significant impact on patients health Improving awareness and monitoring is crucial and must be addressed Increased clarity of monitoring guidelines will circumvent side effects

with the Sendaivirus envelope glycoproteins FHN rSIVFHN that is effective at transducing pulmonary epithelium in vivo To prepare for a firstinman clinical trial, we have developed protocols that can be used in a mouse GLPtoxicology study to efficiently transduce nasaltissue or lungs Reporterimaging, molecular, and radiopharmaceutical tracing methods have been used to quantify intranasally administered lentiviral vector deposition and subsequent tissuelevel transgene expression in mice Nose study A standard 100 µL vector bolus administration nasal sniffing was compared to slow perfusion via catheter 67µLmin and to small volume pipette dosing 2 × 5µL All animals received 1e7 TUmouse of rSIVFHN expressing luciferase n6group 1012 days after transduction, all methods led to similar gene expression in the nasal cavity Catheterbased delivery led to significant p005 spillover into the lung and was discontinued In contrast to nasal sniffing, pipetting of small volumes abrogated lung transgene expression Technetium radiotracer 5MBq of 99mTcDTPAmouse showed that 981 of the pipetted dose was retained in the head In contrast, nasal sniffing retained only 3612 in the head, with the rest dispersed into lungs 3416 and the remaining body 305 To increase vector delivery to the nasal epithelium, 5 and 10 × 5µL doses at 5 min intervals were administered, up to 24e8 TUmouse n5group, and a doserelated increase in gene expression was observed P00001, r2087 Importantly, even after 10 × 5µL doses, most radiotracer 903 was retained in the head Lung study Comparing nasal sniffing to an oropharyngeal OP delivery method 1e7 TU50µL dose for both techniques, there was no difference in gene expression between lungs By technetium radiotracer 5MBq as before, n56group, there was no difference in dose distribution between lungs sniffing 4018, OP 3711 However, nasal sniffing can deliver double the volume compared to OP Development of protocols for mouse GLPtoxicology studies A A Simian Immunodeficiency Virusbased lentiviral vector rSIVFHN has been administered to mice via intranasal pipette delivery in either a single larger 100 µl or multiple smaller 5 µl volumes and the nose and lung vector distributions and expressions compared B Wholebody and individual lung luciferasereporter transgene expression 1012 days after dosing, showing robust signal in nose and lungs with a single larger volume, undetectable lung signal with a similar titre small volume administration, and an increase in nasaltissue transgene expression with increasing multiple small volume doses, without significant lung spillover RLU  relative light units To optimise target organ vector delivery, we have developed protocols suitable for GLP toxicology studies in the murine nose and lung By defining dose distribution, effective viral titres and overages can be better calculated and compared to proposed clinical doses in future toxicology studies,Firefighters work in a safety critical role and undergo comprehensive preemployment screening Applicants with a history of asthma often made in childhood are regularly referred to our specialist occupational lung disease service for additional assessment including measurement of nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness NSBHR No studies have reported the impact of a preexisting asthma diagnosis on future employment as a firefighter most have studied current firefighters1 or others in safety critical roles2 We sought to identify factors associated with a positive NSBHR test amongst UK firefighter applicants, and to link these to symptoms and employment status around one year later We reviewed case notes for all firefighter applicants referred between 20052019 we defined NSBHR as a fall in FEV1 of at least 20 provocation concentration PC20 following inhalation of 8 mgml histamine Around one year after their initial appointment we contacted them for follow up, including enquiring about their application outcome and current respiratory symptoms Clinical data were available on 120 applicants of whom 19 16 had a positive NSBHR test see table 1 Followup data were available on 116 applicants Those with a positive NSBHR test n17 147 were less likely to be accepted into the fire service than those with a negative test 765 vs 950 respectively, p0026 However, of the 4 with a positive NSBHR and not accepted by the fire service, only 2 were due to asthma Of the 90 serving firefighters at followup, only 2 22 reported any recent trouble with asthma Findings stratified by NSBHR test result data are presented as n unless otherwise stated Pvalues are calculated excluding the not recorded data NSBHR is associated with atopy and a lower FEV1 but it was not otherwise possible to predict NSBHR Although many applicants had a history of asthma and 16 a positive NSBHR result, encouragingly, only two individuals applications were rejected due to their asthma individuals with a history of asthma should not be deterred from applying to become a firefighter Specialist assessment may be useful in determining evidence of asthma amongst firefighter applicants prior to recruitment Miedinger D Chest, 200713117601767 Miedinger D Clinical  Experimental Allergy, 201040224231,An Integrated Respiratory Team IRT was established as a service innovation pilot project to improve outcomes for patients with COPD As part of the IRT pilot, a Virtual ward for patients discharged from hospital within the past 30 days was established, in order to address aspects of care that would impact on 30 day readmission rates which had peaked at 24 in April and May 2018 Meetings were held weekly including new IRT members of the multidisciplinary team alongside existing community respiratory team to address factors which might lead to increased risk of readmission The IRT pilot project focused on patients within 2 localities within the county covering a population of 315,694 with 3994 diagnosed with COPD 126 prevalence Weekly meetings were held over 15 months, attended by the Respiratory consultant, IRT lead nurse, Occupational Therapist, Physiotherapist, Psychological Therapist and members of the existing community team As well as clinical management, aspects of care addressed included referrals to smoking cessation, referrals for home exercise or pulmonary rehabilitation, assessment of psychological status and referral for therapy if indicated, identification of those patients where an advanced care plan would be appropriate, and housing issues heating, damp related to environmental risks to health Outcomes of intervention within the virtual ward meetings 267 City patients and 153 North patients were admitted to the virtual ward 105 24 patients were readmitted with a COPD exacerbation during the 15month duration of project However, only 37 86 were readmitted within 30 days of the index admission During this period, patients outside the IRT area within the county had a 30day readmission rate of 149, Local COPD readmission rates had remained around 148 for the 5 years up to 201718 1 This readmission data suggests that for this group of patients who received enhanced multidisciplinary input from the IRT, there was a reduction in 30 day readmission rates which would lead to improved outcomes for individual patients, and potential health economic benefits if extrapolated to the whole patient population 2nd Atlas of Variation in risk factors and health care for respiratory disease in England 2019 httptoolsenglandnhsukimagesRespiratoryAtlasatlashtml Accessed 19082019,Background Acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS is a severe and often fatal disease The causes that lead to ARDS are multiple and include inhalation of salt water, smoke particles, or as a result of damage caused by respiratory viruses ARDS can also arise due to systemic complications such as blood transfusions, sepsis, or pancreatitis Unfortunately, despite a high mortality rate of 40, there are limited treatment options available for ARDS outside of last resort options such as mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal support strategies Aim of review A complication of ARDS is the development of pulmonary hypertension PH however, the mechanisms that lead to PH in ARDS are not fully understood In this review, we summarize the known mechanisms that promote PH in ARDS Key scientific concepts of review 1 Provide an overview of acute respiratory distress syndrome 2 delineate the mechanisms that contribute to the development of PH in ARDS 3 address the implications of PH in the setting of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19,ObjectiveshypothesisTo investigate the effect of FFP3 mask usage on venous blood gases VBG and some subjective symptomsMethodsVBG analyses and subjective symptom questionary were obtained from 15 healthcare proffesionals before and after 4h FFP3 mask usageResultsWearing an FFP3 mask for 4u2009hours did not change any venous blood gas parameters between pre and postvalues, statistically According to an 8symptom questionary, only nausea did not show any significance Headache, lightheadedness, visual difficulties, shortness of breath, palpitation, confusion, and difficult communication showed statistically significant difference between pre and post valuesConclusionFourhour use of FFP3 mask did not cause any significant VBG change Although the participants complained about some subjective symptoms, this study indicated that longterm use of FFP3 mask did not cause any significant discomforts, and it was well tolerated,Air pollution in the environment and in households is responsible worldwide for almost 9xa0million preventable premature deaths per year and almost 800,000 such deaths within Europe Air pollution therefore shortens life expectancy worldwide by almost 3xa0years Smoking, a proven cardiovascular risk factor, shortens the mean life expectancy by 22xa0years Epidemiological studies have shown that air pollution from fine and coarse particulate matter is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality Responsible for this are mainly cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary heart disease, heart attack, heart failure, stroke, hypertension and also diabetes, which are mainly caused or aggravated by fine particulate matter After inhalation fine particulate matter can reach the brain directly and also reach the bloodstream via axa0transition process There, the particles are absorbed by the blood vessels where they stimulate the formation of reactive oxygen species ROS in the vascular wall They therefore promote the formation of atherosclerotic changes and in this way increase the cardiovascular risks, especially an increase in chronic ischemic heart disease and stroke Recent studies also reported that in coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 patients axa0high degree of air pollution is correlated with severe disease courses with cardiovascular complications and pulmonary diseases This necessitates preventive measures, such as lowering of the upper limits for air pollutants Individual measures to mitigate the health consequences of fine particulate matter are also discussed,,BACKGROUND Obstructive sleep apnoea OSA is associated with higher body mass index BMI, diabetes, older age and male gender, which are all risk factors for severe COVID19We aimed to study if OSA is an independent risk factor for COVID19 infection or for severe COVID19 METHODS OSA diagnosis and COVID19 infection were extracted from the hospital discharge, causes of death and infectious diseases registries in individuals who participated in the FinnGen study n260 405 Severe COVID19 was defined as COVID19 requiring hospitalisation Multivariate logistic regression model was used to examine association Comorbidities for either COVID19 or OSA were selected as covariates We performed a metaanalysis with previous studies RESULTS We identified 445 individuals with COVID19, and 38 85 of them with OSA of whom 19 out of 91 209 were hospitalised OSA associated with COVID19 hospitalisation independent from age, sex, BMI and comorbidities punadjusted513×105, ORadjusted293 95 CI 102 to 839, padjusted0045 OSA was not associated with the risk of contracting COVID19 p025 A metaanalysis of OSA and severe COVID19 showed association across 15 835 COVID19 positive controls, and n1294 patients with OSA with severe COVID19 OR237 95 114 to 495, p0021 CONCLUSION Risk for contracting COVID19 was the same for patients with OSA and those without OSA In contrast, among COVID19 positive patients, OSA was associated with higher risk for hospitalisation Our findings are in line with earlier works and suggest OSA as an independent risk factor for severe COVID19,AIMS The novel coronavirus SARSCoV2 has shown the potential to significantly affect the cardiovascular system Cardiac arrhythmias are commonly reported complications in COVID19 hospitalized patients METHODS AND RESULTS While tachyarrhythmias seem most common, we describe four cases of COVID19 patients who developed a transient highdegree atrioventricular AV block during the course of their hospitalization All four patients who developed a highdegree AV block during their hospitalization with COVID19 did not require permanent pacing CONCLUSION Similarly to most AV blocks associated with infectious organisms and given its transient nature, this case series suggests that conservative management strategies should be preferred in COVID19 patients who develop complete heart block,BACKGROUND Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation VAECMO is increasingly used as a lifesaving therapy for patients with cardiovascular collapse, but identifying patients unlikely to benefit remains a challenge METHODS AND RESULTS We created the RESCUE registry, a retrospective, observational registry of adult patients treated with VAECMO between January 2007 and June 2017 at 3 highvolume centers Columbia University, Duke University, and Washington University to describe shortterm patient outcomes In 723 patients treated with VAECMO, the most common indications for deployment were postcardiotomy shock 31, cardiomyopathy including acute heart failure 26, and myocardial infarction 17 Patients frequently suffered inhospital complications, including acute renal dysfunction 45, major bleeding 41, and infection 33 Only 40 of patients nu202fu202f290 survived to discharge, with a minority receiving durable cardiac support left ventricular assist device nu202fu202f48 or heart transplantation nu202fu202f7 Multivariable regression analysis identified risk factors for mortality on ECMO as older age odds ratio OR, 126 95 confidence interval CI, 112142 and female sex OR, 144 95 CI, 102202 and risk factors for mortality after decannulation as higher body mass index OR 117 95 CI, 101135 and major bleeding while on ECMO support OR, 192 95 CI, 123299 CONCLUSIONS Despite contemporary care at highvolume centers, patients treated with VAECMO continue to have significant inhospital morbidity and mortality The optimization of outcomes will require refinements in patient selection and improvement of care delivery,Background The t 2 5 chromosomal rearrangement and resulting nucleophosmin NPM1 ALK fusion was first observed in 1994 in anaplastic large cell lymphoma ALCL, a Tcell lymphoma responsive to cyclophosphamide, abriblastine, vincristine and prednisone in approximately 80 of cases refractory cases usually respond favorably to brentuximabvedotin These treatments are regarded as a bridge to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation alloSCT Nowadays, transplant procedures and monitoring of chemotherapy patients proceed very slowly because the SARSCoV2 pandemic has heavily clogged the hospitals in all countries Results A 40yearold Caucasian woman was first seen at our clinical center in June 2020 She had ALCL ALK , a history of failure to two previous therapeutic lines and was in complete remission after 12 courses of Brentuximab, still pending alloSCT after two failed donor selection Facing of a new therapeutic failure, we requested the Italian drug regulatory agency, and obtained the authorization, to administer 250 mg twice a day of Crizotinib, a drug incomprehensibly not registered for ALCL ALK  Conclusions The response to Crizotinib was optimal, since no adverse event occurred, and CTPET persisted negative this drug has proved to be a valid bridge to alloSCT,Infective and inflammatory diseases can mimic malignancy of the lung Granulomatous inflammations are common causes of pulmonary nodule, mass, or nodal disease Systemic infection or inflammation also commonly involves the lung that may raise suspicion of a malignant process Even in patients with a known malignancy, inflammatory diseases can simulate new metastasis or disease progression Knowledge of the imaging features of these diseases is essential to prevent missed or overdiagnosis of malignancy Radiologists also need to be familiar with the scope and limitations of bronchoscopy, endobronchial ultrasound, PETCT, and biopsy to guide clinical management In this review, we discuss the imaging features and diagnostic approach of common mimickers of chest malignancy that involve the chest wall, pleura, lung parenchyma, and mediastinal nodes,The discovery of iPSCs has led to the ex vivo production of differentiated cells for regenerative medicine In the case of transfusion products, the derivation of platelets from iPSCs is expected to complement our current blooddonor supplied transfusion system through donorindependent production with complete pathogenfree assurance This derivation can also overcome alloimmune platelet transfusion refractoriness by resulting in autologous, HLAhomologous or HLAdeficient products Several developments were necessary to produce a massive number of platelets required for a single transfusion First, expandable megakaryocytes were established from iPSCs through transgene expression Second, a turbulenttype bioreactor with improved platelet yield and quality was developed Third, novel drugs that enabled efficient feeder cellfree conditions were developed Fourth, the plateletcontaining suspension was purified and resuspended in an appropriate buffer Finally, the platelet product needed to be assured for competency and safety including nontumorigenicity through in vitro and in vivo preclinical tests Based on these advancements, a clinical trial has started The generation of human iPSCderived platelets could evolve transfusion medicine to the next stage and assure a ubiquitous, safe supply of platelet products Further, considering the feasibility of gene manipulations in iPSCs, other platelet products may bring forth novel therapeutic measures,ObjectivesTo quantify the heterogeneity of fibrosis boundaries in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis IPF using the Gaussian curvature analysis for evaluating disease severity and predicting survivalMethodsWe retrospectively included 104 IPF patients and 52 controls who underwent baseline chest CT scans Normal lungs below  500 HU were segmented, and the boundary was threedimensionally reconstructed using inhouse software Gaussian curvature analysis provided histogram features on the heterogeneity of the fibrosis boundary We analyzed the correlations between histogram features and the genderagephysiology GAP and CT fibrosis scores We built a regression model to predict diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide DLCO using the histogram features and calculated the modified GAP mGAP score by replacing DLCO with the predicted DLCO The performances of the GAP, CTGAP, and mGAP scores were compared using 100 repeated randomsplit setsResultsPatients with moderatetosevere IPF had more numerous Gaussian curvatures at the fibrosis boundary, lower uniformity, and lower 10th to 30th percentiles of Gaussian curvature than controls or patients with mild IPF all p  00033 The 20th percentile was most significantly correlated with the GAP score r   0357 p  0001 and the CT fibrosis score r   0343 p  0001 More numerous Gaussian curvatures, higher entropy, lower uniformity, and 10th to 30th percentiles p  00010041 were associated with mortality The mGAP score was comparable to the GAP and CTGAP scores for survival prediction mean Cindices, 076 vs 079 vs 077, respectivelyConclusionsGaussian curvatures of fibrosis boundaries became more heterogeneous as the disease progressed, and heterogeneity was negatively associated with survival in IPFKey Points• Gaussian curvature of the fibrotic lung boundary was more heterogeneous in patients with moderatetosevere IPF than those with mild IPF or normal controls• The 20th percentile of the Gaussian curvature of the fibrosis boundary was linearly correlated with the GAP score and the CT fibrosis score• A modified GAP score that replaced the diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide with a composite measure using histogram features of the Gaussian curvature of the fibrosis boundary showed a comparable ability to predict survival to both the GAP and the CTGAP score,OBJECTIVE To test feasibility of teleclinic visits using parentally acquired vital signs and focused echocardiographic images in patients with Marfan syndrome STUDY DESIGN We included patients with Marfan syndrome aged 519xa0years followed in our clinic We excluded patients with Marfan syndrome and history of previous aortic root AoR surgery, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, or AoR 45xa0cm We trained parents inperson to acquire focused echocardiographic images on their children using a handheld device as well as how to use a stadiometer, scale, blood pressure BP machine, and a digital stethoscope Before teleclinic visits, parents obtained the echocardiographic images and vital signs We compared teleclinic and onsite clinic visit data Parental and clinic echocardiograms were independently analyzed RESULTS Fifteen patientparent pairs completed teleclinic visits, conducted at a median of 70 IQR 3099 months from the inperson training session Parents took a median of 70 IQR 60150 minutes to obtain the height, weight, heart rate, BP, cardiac sounds, and echocardiographic images before teleclinic visits Systolic BP was greater onsite than at home median 13xa0mm Hg, Pxa0xa0014 Height, weight, diastolic BP, heart rate, and AoR measurements were similar CONCLUSIONS This study provides information for implementing teleclinic visits using parentally acquired vital signs and echocardiographic images in patients with Marfan syndrome The results show that teleclinic visits are feasible and that parents were able to obtain focused echocardiographic images on their children TRIAL REGISTRATION ClinicalTrialsgov NCT03581682,Background The role of chest computed tomographic CT to diagnosis coronavirus disease2019 COVID19 is still an open field to be explored The aim of this study was to apply the decision tree DT model to predict critical or noncritical status of patients infected with COVID19 based on available information on noncontrast CT scanMethod This study was performed onpatients with COVID19 who underwent chest CTscan atBaqiyatallahHospital, Tehran, Iran In this retrospectivestudy, the medical records of 1078 patients with COVID19 were evaluated The classification and regression tree CART of decision treemodeland kfold cross validation were used to predict the status of patients and to measure their sensitivity, specificity and area under curve AUCResults Data included 169 critical cases and 909 noncritical cases The bilateral distribution and multifocal lung involvement were165 976 and 766 843 in critical patients, respectivelyAccording to DT model, total opacity score, age, lesion types and gender were statistically significant predictors incritical patientsMoreover, the results showed that the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the DT model were 933, 728 and 971, respectivelyConclusions The presented algorithm demonstrates the factors affecting the patients condition In addition, this model has the potential characteristics for clinical applicationsand canalso identify highrisk subpopulations that need specific prevention,,The COVID19 pandemic is the greatest lifethreatening disaster currently facing the worldwide population Patients infected with SARSCoV2 suffer from sore throat, dry cough, high fever, fatigue, and headache In addition, patients often lose their sense of smell and taste in the early stage of the disease Some patients, especially those with concomitant diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular problems, quickly develop severe pneumonia with low arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry SpO2 and multiorgan failure, resulting in sudden death All of these symptoms are caused by deadly inflammation that occurs in various organs all over the body Various types of inflammation caused by RNA virus infection have been known to be manageable by induction of heme oxygenase1 HO1 in local tissues, and HO1 is also known to be a key enzyme for the suppression of RNA viral replication Therefore, in addition to standard medical care for pneumonic viral infection, we have attempted to treat COVID19 patients using a highly effective HO1 inducer, 5aminolevulinic acid phosphate, in combination with sodium ferrous citrate 5ALA with SFC, a supplement formulation registered in Japan as a food with functional claims Six patients with typical symptoms of COVID19 and some suspected COPD associated with heavy smoking were received oral administration of multiple doses of 5ALA with SFC at the maximum tolerated dose MTD for 3 to 7 days followed by treatment with a lower dose of 5ALA with SFC for 2 to 3 weeks The recovery time of each individual patient was significantly shorter than reported for patients who received only standard care for coronavirus infection These results confirm the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 5ALA with SFC as a therapeutic supplement for patients with acutephase COVID19,In glucose Glc metabolism, lactate dehydrogenase LDH functions by changing pyruvate into lactate Lactate dehydrogenase LDH release is induced viacell death, suggesting to disease caused by virus or pulmonary deterioration, such as inflammation of the lung triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 SARSCoV2 A satisfactory evidence exists by binding elevated lactate dehydrogenase LDH levels to the development of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 complications,Background Early differential diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 and Mycoplasma Pneumonia MP are hampered by nonspecific symptoms, the lack of rapid responding laboratory measures and the presence of family aggregation Chest computed tomography CT plays a significant role to detect the distribution, density and morphology of lesions caused by either COVID19 or MP Objectives To compare the symptoms, laboratory parameters, and chest CT results of adults with COVID19 and MP and to assess the use of these findings in the differential diagnosis of these diseases Patients and Methods The initial clinical manifestations, laboratory results, and chest CT findings of 45 adult patients with COVID19 COVID19 group and 55 adult patients with MP MP group were reviewed retrospectively All of the patients were diagnosed in the public hospitals in the epidemic area from 20 January to 28 February 2020 Results Muscle ache and fatigue were more frequently present in the COVID19 group P  0009 and 0029, respectively Increased procalcitonin levels were more common in the MP group P  0001 The chest CT results indicated that bilateral lung involvement, ground glass opacities, crazypaving patterns, and air bronchogram signs were more common in the COVID19 group P  0001 for all, respectively However, single lobe involvement, pulmonary consolidations, lobular central nodules, generalized bronchial wall thickening with luminal stenosis, and bronchial mucus impaction were more common in the MP group P  0001 for all Receiver operating characteristic analysis of a model established using CT parameters indicated a good or excellent performance in distinguishing COVID19 from MP Conclusion COVID19 and MP have similar clinical manifestations and laboratory results in early stage However, the chest CT findings are valuable in the differential diagnosis of these two diseases, particularly in patients from COVID19 epidemic areas,INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 Atrial fibrillation AF is common in acute situations, where it is associated with more complications and higher mortality METHODS Analysis of the international HOPE registry NCT04334291 The objective was to assess the prognostic information of AF in COVID19 patients A multivariate analysis and propensity score matching were performed to assess the relationship between AF and mortality We also evaluated the impact on mortality and embolic events of the CHA2DS2VASc score in these patients RESULTS Among 6217 patients enrolled in the HOPE registry, 250 had AF 45 AF patients had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities After propensity score matching, these differences were attenuated Despite this, patients with AF had a higher incidence of inhospital complications such as heart failure 193 vs 116, P021 and respiratory insufficiency 759 vs 623, P002, as well as a higher 60day mortality rate 434 vs 309, P005 On multivariate analysis, AF was independently associated with higher 60day mortality hazard ratio, 1234 95CI, 10031519 CHA2DS2VASc score acceptably predicts 60day mortality in COVID19 patients area ROC, 0748 95CI, 07330764, but not its embolic risk area ROC, 0411 95CI, 01470675 CONCLUSIONS AF in COVID19 patients is associated with a higher number of complications and 60day mortality The CHA2DS2VASc score may be a good risk marker in COVID patients but does not predict their embolic risk,In severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2associated disease coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19, hypoxemia mechanisms differ from those observed in acute respiratory distress syndrome Hypoxemia and respiratory failure in COVID 19 are attributed to pulmonary angiopathy, increasing physiological pulmonary shunting13,We present, to our knowledge, the first case of immunosuppressive therapy IST application in a 12yearold child with arrhythmogenic inflammatory cardiomyopathy resulting from the overlap between autoimmune myocarditis and primary arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy Indication to offlable IST was compelling, because of recurrent drugrefractory ventricular arrhythmias VAs We show that IST was feasible, safe, and effective on multiple clinical endpoints, including symptoms, VA recurrences, and Ttroponin release Remarkably, all diagnostic and therapeutic strategies were worked out by a dedicated multidisciplinary team, including specialized pediatric immunologists,Corresponding Author,Article title Bailout extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for hydroxychloroquine intoxication a warning for COVID19 healthcare givers Authors Holvoet, W, van Soest, K, Havenith, T, Lorusso,The aim of this study was to analyze initial chest computed tomography CT findings in COVID19 pneumonia and identify features associated with poor prognosis Patients with RTPCRconfirmed COVID19 infection were assigned to recovery group if they made a full recovery and to death group if they died within 2xa0months of hospitalization Chest CT examinations for groundglass opacity, crazypaving pattern, consolidation, and fibrosis were scored by two reviewers The total CT score comprised the sum of lung involvement 5 lobes, scores 15 for each lobe, range 0, none 25, maximum 40 patients who recovered from COVID19 and six patients who died were enrolled The initial chest CTs showed 27 587 patients had groundglass opacity, 19 413 had ground glass and consolidation, and 35 761 patients had crazypaving pattern None of the patients who died had fibrosis in contrast to six 15 patients who recovered from COVID19 Most patients had subpleural lesions 890 as well as bilateral 870 and lower 930 lung lobe involvement Diffuse lesions were present in four 67 patients who succumbed to coronavirus but only one 25 patient who recovered p,Introduction The rapidly spreading Novel Coronavirus 2019 COVID19 appeared to be a highly transmissible pathogen in healthcare environments and had resulted in a significant number of patients with respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy, an aerosolgenerating procedure that places healthcare workers at high risk of contracting the infection Instead of deferring or delaying the procedure, we developed and implemented a novel percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy PDT protocol aimed at minimizing the risk of transmission while maintaining favorable procedural outcome Patients and Methods All patients who underwent PDT per novel protocol were included in the study The key element of the protocol was the use of apnea during the critical part of the insertion and upon any opening of the ventilator circuit This was coupled with the use of enhanced personnel protection equipment PPE with a powered airpurifying respirator PAPR The operators underwent antibody serology testing and were evaluated for COVID19 symptoms two weeks from the last procedure included in the study Results Between March 12th and June 30th, 2020, a total of 32 patients underwent PDT per novel protocol The majority 80 were positive for COVID19 at the time of the procedure The success rate was 94 Only one patient developed minor selflimited bleeding None of the proceduralists developed positive serology or any symptoms compatible with COVID19 infection Conclusion A novel protocol that uses periods of apnea during opening of the ventilator circuit along with PAPRenhanced PPE for PDT on COVID19 patients appears to be effective and safe for patients and healthcare providers,COVID19 disease, while primarily a respiratory disease, has proven itself a multisystem disorder with profound cardiovascular sequelae In patients with SARSCoV2 infection, effective early diagnosis and management of concomitant cardiovascular manifestations of the disease are key to favorable outcomes Here we present a case series of three patients with varied cardiovascular presentations of severe COVID19 illness cardiogenic shock from Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia in a patient with suspected hydroxychloroquineassociated cardiomyopathy, and rightsided heart failure with obstructive shock in the setting of massive pulmonary embolism Through our experience, we aim to provide a better understanding of the unique spectrum of the cardiovascular effects of severe COVID19 disease to guide management of the critically ill,BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is usually mild, but patients can present with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS, and circulatory shock Although the symptoms of the disease are predominantly respiratory, the involvement of the cardiovascular system is common Patients with heart failure HF are particularly vulnerable when suffering from COVID19 AIM OF THE REVIEW To examine the challenges faced by healthcare organizations, and mechanical circulatory support management strategies available to patients with heart failure, during the COVID19 pandemic RESULTS Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ECMO can be lifesaving in patients with severe forms of ARDS, or refractory cardiocirculatory compromise The Impella RP can provide right ventricular circulatory support for patients who develop right side ventricular failure or decompensation caused by COVID19 complications, including pulmonary embolus HT are reserved for only those patients with a high shortterm mortality LVAD as a bridge to transplant may be a viable strategy to get atrisk patients home quickly Elective LVAD implantations have been reduced and only patients classified as INTERMACS profile 1 and 2 are being considered for LVAD implantation Delayed recognition of LVADrelated complications, misdiagnosis of COVID19, and impaired social and psychological wellbeing for patients and families may ensue Remote patient care with virtual or telephone contacts is becoming the norm CONCLUSIONS HF incidence, prevalence, and undertreatment will grow as a result of new COVID19related heart disease ECMO should be reserved for highly selected cases of COVID19 with a reasonable probability of recovery Special considerations are needed for patients with advanced HF, including those supported by durable LVADs,BACKGROUND We describe the baseline, operative, and postoperative features of a group of 18 patients who contracted the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 infection in a rehabilitation facility after cardiac surgery, and present some potential explanations for the surprisingly benign course of the COVID19 in this cohort METHODS All patients were operated on an urgent or emergency basis acute aortic syndrome, 3 refractory heart failure, 12 and endocarditis, 3 during the firstxa0lockdown period of the COVID19 pandemic The mean age was 70 years, and 12 patients were male After the diagnosis of COVID19, patients were treated according to the most recent recommendations Eleven asymptomatic patients were discharged home or to a COVID19 hotel and underwent close monitoring Patients with fever, dyspnea, or a significant rise of the polymerase chain reaction levels were hospitalized, three received antivirals, threexa0azithromicyne, and fivexa0hydroxychloroquine Nasal swabs were repeated on a weekly basis, and all patients were quarantined until the collection of two consecutive negative samples RESULTS Diversely from other observations on perioperative COVID19 reporting mortality rates of 3040, the COVID19 had a benign course in our cohort only seven patients required hospitalization, and one required short intensive care unit admission There were no deaths, and at the latest followup, all patients had been discharged home COMMENT Our data show that the SARSCoV2 infection after cardiac surgery may have a benign course Further studies are needed to investigate the relationship between the timing of the infection, some potentially protective therapies eg, anticoagulants, and the course of the COVID19,To date, seven identified coronaviruses CoVs have been found to infect humans of these, three highly pathogenic variants have emerged in the 21st century The newest member of this group, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2, was first detected at the end of 2019 in Hubei province, China Since then, this novel coronavirus has spread worldwide, causing a pandemic the respiratory disease caused by the virus is called coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 The clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic to mild respiratory tract infections and influenzalike illness to severe disease with accompanying lung injury, multiorgan failure, and death Although the lungs are believed to be the site at which SARSCoV2 replicates, infected patients often report other symptoms, suggesting the involvement of the gastrointestinal tract, heart, cardiovascular system, kidneys, and other organs therefore, the following question arises is COVID19 a respiratory or systemic disease This review aims to summarize existing data on the replication of SARSCoV2 in different tissues in both patients and ex vivo models,Human hematopoietic stem cells HSCs express CD34 and Thy1 lo on their surface and are capable of multilineage growth and supporting longterm hematopoiesis These cells can be isolated from bone marrow, peripheral blood after mobilization, and umbilical cord blood and may be autologous or allogeneic in nature While bone marrow had been the gold standard for more than 30xa0years, peripheral blood stem cells have now become the more prevalent source of hematopoietic stem cells along with increasing numbers of umbilical cord blood products utilized for transplantation All three sources have their pros and cons for both the donor and the recipient Additionally, the successful implementation of haploidentical donors has opened up the option of transplantation to patients for whom a donor had not been previously identified Most recently, the outbreak of SARSCoV2 CoVID19 and the resultant pandemic has impacted the standard process by which donors are identified and hematopoietic stem cells are collected Identification of a donor is a complicated process, becoming more refined as the science progresses,The secondary prevention SP of coronary heart disease CHD has become a major public health and economic burden worldwide In the United States, the prevalence of CHD has risen to 18 million, the incidence of recurrent myocardial infarctions MI remains high, and related healthcare costs are projected to double by 2035 In the last decade, practice guidelines and performance measures for the SP of CHD have increasingly emphasized evidencebased lifestyle LS interventions, including healthy dietary patterns, regular exercise, smoking cessation, weight management, depression screening, and enrollment in cardiac rehabilitation However, data show large gaps in adherence to healthy LS behaviors and low rates of enrollment in cardiac rehabilitation in patients with established CHD These gaps may be related, since behavior change interventions have not been well integrated into traditional ambulatory care models in the United States The chronic care model, an evidencebased practice framework that incorporates clinical decision support, selfmanagement support, teamcare delivery and other strategies for delivering chronic care is well suited for both chronic CHD management and prevention interventions, including those related to behavior change This article reviews the evidence base for LS interventions for the SP of CHD, discusses current gaps in adherence, and presents strategies for closing these gaps via evidencebased and emerging interventions that are conceptually aligned with the elements of the chronic care model,BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Transradial access for neurointerventional procedures has been proved a safer and more comfortable alternative to femoral artery access We present our experience with transradial distal radialanatomic snuffbox and radial artery access for treatment of intracranial aneurysms using all 3 FDAapproved flow diverters MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a highvolume, dualcenter, retrospective analysis of each institutions data base between June 2018 and June 2020 and a collection of all patients treated with flow diversion via transradial access Patient demographic information and procedural and radiographic data were obtained RESULTS Seventyfour patients were identified 64 female patients with a mean age of 575u2009years with a total of 86 aneurysms Most aneurysms were located in the anterior circulation 93 and within the intracranial ICA 674 The mean aneurysm size was 55u2009mm Flow diverters placed included the Pipeline Embolization Device Flex PED, n  65, the Surpass Streamline Flow Diverter n  8, and the FlowRedirection Endoluminal Device FRED, n  1 Transradial access was successful in all cases, but femoral crossover was required in 3 cases 41 due to tortuous anatomy and inadequate support of the catheters in 2 cases and an inability to navigate to the target vessel in a patient with an aberrant right subclavian artery All 71 other interventions were successfully performed via the transradial approach 959 No access site complications were encountered Asymptomatic radial artery occlusion was encountered in 1 case 37 CONCLUSIONS Flow diverters can be successfully placed via the transradial approach with high technical success, low access site complications, and a low femoral crossover rate,Shortness of breath is a common complaint among patients in emergency medicine While most common causes are usually promptly identified, less frequent aetiologies might be challenging to diagnose, especially in the prehospital setting We report a case of prehospital dyspnoea initially ascribed to pulmonary oedema which turned out to be the result of profound metforminassociated metabolic acidosis This diagnosis was already made during the prehospital phase by virtue of arterial blood gas measurement Prehospital measurement of arterial blood gases is therefore feasible and can improve diagnostic accuracy in the field, thus avoiding unnecessary delay and potential harm to the patient before initiating the appropriate therapeutic actions,There seems to an increase in the presentations to our Emergency Department with patients with complete heart block The important question is whether this is an apparent increase in numbers or a true increase in numbers of presentations remains to be seen It has been well recognised that across the Emergency Departments in the United Kingdom, there has been a fall in the number of attendances In some estimates, this has been as low as a 30 reduction in the number of ED attendances when compared with figures in the previous years,Different mechanisms of lung injury in COVID19 have been described, like viral to immunemediated mechanisms Lung injury can be either subsequent to chronic inflammation or an idiopathic and genetically influenced process Pulmonary fibrosis can occur with acute lung injury  a known sequela to ARDS However, persistent radiological abnormalities after ARDS are of little clinical significance and have dwindled with protective lung ventilation Pulmonary fibrosis is associated with permanent pulmonary architectural distortion and irreversible lung dysfunction Available clinical, radiographic, and autopsy data has indicated that pulmonary fibrosis is central to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome SARS and MERS pathology, and current evidence suggests that pulmonary fibrosis could also complicate infection by SARSCoV2 The aim of this review is to explore the current literature on the pathogenesis of lung injury in COVID19 infection, its risk factors  to find out the possible effective therapy within the existing medication After literature review, we conclude that, currently there are no approved therapies for SARS COV2 Trials are based on drugs that are already approved for other diseases, have acceptable safety profiles or have been effective in animal studies against the other two highly pathogenic coronaviruses Apart from the potent use of antivirals to reduce the viral effects, the use of antifibrotic therapies could also be under consideration based on the pulmonary fibrotic disease observed after COVID19 recovery Pirfenidone and Nintedanib are the two approved anti fibrotic drugs for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis IPF Despite having different modes of action, both are effective in attenuating the rate of lung function decline and are widely considered to improve life expectancy J MEDICINE JAN 2021 22 1  4650,BACKGROUND An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 has occurred worldwide However, the smallairway disease in patients with COVID19 has not been explored AIM This study aimed to explore the smallairway disease in patients with COVID19 using inspiratory and expiratory chest highresolution computed tomography CT METHODS This multicenter study included 108 patients with COVID19 The patients were classified into five stages 0IV based on the CT images The clinical and imaging data were compared among CT images in different stages Patients were divided into three groups according to the time interval from the initial CT scan, and the clinical and air trapping data were compared among these groups The correlation between clinical parameters and CT scores was evaluated RESULTS The clinical data, including age, frequency of breath shortness and dyspnea, neutrophil percentage, lymphocyte count, PaO2, PaCO2, SaO2, and time interval between the onset of illness and initial CT, showed significant differences among CT images in different stages A significant difference in the CT score of air trapping was observed between stage I and stage III A low negative correlation was found between the CT score of air trapping and time interval between the onset of symptoms and initial CT No significant difference was noted in the frequency and CT score of air trapping among different groups CONCLUSIONS Some patients with COVID19 developed smallairway disease Air trapping was more distinguished in the early stage of the disease and persisted during the 2month followup Longerterm followup studies are needed to confirm the findings,The goal of the present work was to examine associations between COVID19 pneumonia severity and pulmonary artery diameter A total of 101xa0patients with COVID19 were included in this retrospective observational study The patients were divided into three groups based on the CT images 41xa0patients with mild pneumonia, groupxa02 had 39xa0patients with moderate pneumonia, and groupxa03 had 21xa0patients with severe pneumonia Furthermore, the diameter of the main pulmonary artery was calculated as well as ascending aorta, right and left pulmonary artery diameters Laboratory analysis results were also compared Analyses show an increased main pulmonary artery diameter is associated with poorer prognosis for patients with COVID19 pneumonia Further studies are needed into the mechanisms between severe hypoxemia, increased inflammation, and vascular resistance and higher numbers of thromboembolic events,The COVID19 pandemic underscored our healthcare systems unpreparedness to manage an unprecedented pandemic Heart failure HF physicians from 14 different academic and private practice centers share their systems challenges and innovations to care for patients with HF, heart transplantation, and patients on LVAD support during the COVID19 pandemic We discuss measures implemented to alleviate the fear in seeking care, ensure continued optimization of guideline directed medical therapy GDMT, manage the heart transplant waiting list, continue essential outpatient monitoring of anticoagulation in LVAD patients and surveillance testing postheart transplant, and prevent physician burnout This collaborative work can build a foundation for better preparation in the face of future challenges,COVID19 caused by a novel coronavirus named SARSCoV2, can elites severe acute respiratory syndrome, severe lung injury, cardiac injury, and even death and became a worldwide pandemic SARSCoV2 infection may result in cardiac injury via several mechanisms, including the expression of angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2 receptor and leading to a cytokine storm, can elicit an exaggerated host immune response This response contributes to multiorgan dysfunction As an emerging infectious disease, there are limited data on the effects of this infection on patients with underlying cardiovascular comorbidities In this review, we summarize the earlystage clinical experiences with COVID19, with particular focus on patients with cardiovascular diseases and cardiopulmonary injuries, and explores potential available evidence regarding the association between COVID19, and cardiovascular complications,COVID19 is an infectious respiratory illness caused by the virus strain severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 and until now, there is no effective therapy against COVID19 Since SARSCoV2 binds to angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2 for entering into host cells, to target COVID19 from therapeutic angle, we engineered a hexapeptide corresponding to the ACE2interacting domain of SARSCoV2 AIDS that inhibits the association between receptorbinding domaincontaining spike S1 and ACE2 Accordingly, wild type wt, but not mutated m, AIDS peptide inhibited SARSCoV2 spike S1induced activation of NFκB and expression of IL6 in human lungs cells Interestingly, intranasal intoxication of C57BL6 mice with recombinant SARSCoV2 spike S1 led to fever, increase in IL6 in lungs, infiltration of neutrophils into the lungs, arrhythmias, and impairment in locomotor activities, mimicking some of the important symptoms of COVID19 However, intranasal treatment with wtAIDS, but not mAIDS, peptide reduced fever, protected lungs, improved heart function, and enhanced locomotor activities in SARSCoV2 spike S1intoxicated mice Therefore, selective targeting of ACE2toSARSCoV2 interaction by wtAIDS may be beneficial for COVID19Graphical Abstract,Clinical characteristics are essential for the correct diagnosis of diseases The current review aimed to summarize the global clinical characteristics of the COVID19 patients systematically and identify their diagnostic challenges to help the medical practitioners properly diagnose and for better management of COVID19 patients We conducted a systematic search in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases for original articles containing clinical information of COVID19 published up to 7th May 2020 Two researchers independently searched the databases to extract eligible articles A total of 34 studies from 8 different countries with 10889 casepatients were included for clinical characteristics The most common clinical symptoms were cough 596, fever 469, fatigue 278, and dyspnea 2023 The prominent laboratory findings were lymphocytopenia 559, elevated levels of CRP 619, aspartate aminotransferase 533, LDH 408, ESR 7299, serum ferritin 63, IL6 52, and prothrombin time 3547, and decreased levels of platelets 1726, eosinophils 590, hemoglobin 29, and albumin 384 CT scan of the chest showed an abnormality in 9350 cases with bilateral lungs 711, groundglass opacity 48, lesion in lungs 783, and enlargement of lymph node 507 Common comorbidities were hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases The estimated median incubation period was 536 days, and the overall case fatality rate was 169 Global case fatality outside China was 2224 USA 2124, Italy 2561, and others 0 whereas the case fatality inside the Hubei Province of China was found to be 1171 Global features on the clinical characteristics of COVID19 obtained from laboratory tests and CT scan results will provide useful information to the physicians to diagnose the disease and for better management of the patients as well as to address the diagnostic challenges to control the infection,This study applied causal criteria in directed acyclic graphs for handling covariates in associations for prognosis of severe coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 cases To identify nonspecific blood tests and risk factors as predictors of hospitalisation due to COVID19, one has to exclude noisy predictors by comparing the concordance statistics area under the curve  AUC for positive and negative cases of severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus2 SARSCoV2 Predictors with significant AUC at negative stratum should be either controlled for their confounders or eliminated when confounders are unavailable Models were classified according to the difference of AUC between strata The framework was applied to an open database with 5644 patients from Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in Brazil with SARSCoV2 reverse transcription  polymerase chain reaction RTPCR exam Creactive protein CRP was a noisy predictor hospitalisation could have happened due to causes other than COVID19 even when SARSCoV2 RTPCR is positive and CRP is reactive, as most cases are asymptomatic to mild Candidates of characteristic response from moderatetosevere inflammation of COVID19 were combinations of eosinophils, monocytes and neutrophils, with age as risk factor and creatinine, as risk factor, sharpens the odds ratio of the model with monocytes, neutrophils and age,Background Myocardial injury is a lifethreatening complication of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 Preexisting health conditions and early morphological alterations may precipitate cardiac injury and dysfunction after contracting the virus The current study aimed at assessing potential risk factors for COVID19 cardiac complications in patients with preexisting conditions and imaging predictors Methods and Results The multicenter, retrospective cohort study consecutively enrolled 400 patients with labconfirmed COVID19 in six Chinese hospitals remote to the Wuhan epicenter Patients were diagnosed with or without the complication of myocardial injury by history and cardiac biomarker Troponin IT TnIT elevation above the 99th percentile upper reference limit The majority of COVID19 patients with myocardial injury exhibited preexisting health conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and coronary disease They had increased levels of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin6 and more inhospital adverse events admission to an intensive care unit, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death Chest CT scan on admission demonstrated that COVID19 patients with myocardial injury had higher epicardial adipose tissue volume EATV 1391 8381959 vs 926 7621344 cm2 P  0036 The optimal EATV cutoff value 1371 cm2 served as a useful factor for assessing myocardial injury, which yielded sensitivity and specificity of 550 95CI, 320762 and 774 95CI, 716823 in adverse cardiac events, respectively Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that EATV over 1371 cm2 was a strong independent predictor for myocardial injury in patients with COVID19 OR 3058, 95CI, 10329063 P  0044 Conclusions Augmented EATV on admission chest CT scan, together with the preexisting health conditions hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia and inflammatory cytokine production, is associated with increased myocardial injury and mortality in COVID19 patients Assessment of preexisting conditions and chest CT scan EATV on admission may provide a threshold point potentially useful for predicting cardiovascular complications of COVID19,OBJECTIVES Performing lung ultrasound during the clinical assessment of patients with suspicion of noncritical COVID19 may increase the diagnostic rate of pulmonary involvement over other diagnostic techniques used in routine clinical practice This study aims to compare complications readmissions, emergency department ED visits, and length of outpatient followup in the first 30u2009days after ED discharge in patients with confirmed COVID19 who were managed with versus without lung ultrasound MATERIALS AND METHODS Prospective, observational, analytical study in noncritical patients with confirmed respiratory disease due to SARSCoV2, assessed in the ED of a tertiary Spanish hospital in March and April 2020 We compared 2 cohorts, differentiated by the use of lung ultrasound as a diagnostic tool Complications were assessed hospital admissions, ED revisits and days of outpatient followup at 30u2009days postdischarge RESULTS Of the 88 included patients, 31 n  27 underwent an initial lung ultrasound, while 61 68 did not In 825 of the patients evaluated with ultrasound, the most predominant areas affected were the posterobasal regions, in the form of focalized and confluent Blines 704 showed pleural irregularity in these same areas Use of the lung ultrasound was associated with a greater probability of hospital admission odds ratio 563, 95 confidence interval 331 to 957 p,The most relevant manifestation of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is interstitial pneumonia Several lungxa0ultrasound US protocols for pneumonia diagnosis are used in clinical practice, but none has been proposed for COVID19 patients screening in the emergency department We adopted a simplified 6scan lung US protocol for COVID19 pneumonia diagnosis LUSCOP and compared its sensitivity with high resolution computed tomography HRCT in patients suspected for COVID19, presenting to one Emergency Department from February 21st to March 15th, 2020, during the outbreak burst in northern Italy Patients were retrospectively enrolled if both LUSCOP protocol and HRCT were performed in the Emergency Department The sensitivity of LUSCOP protocol and HRCT were compared COVID19 pneumonias final diagnosis was based on realtime reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction from nasalpharyngeal swab and on clinical data Out of 150 suspected COVID19 patients, 131 were included in the study, and 130 had a final diagnosis of COVID19 pneumonia The most frequent lung ultrasonographic features were bilateral Bpattern in 101 patients 77, Bpattern with subpleural consolidations in 26 198 and lung consolidations in 2 15 LUSCOP Protocol was consistent with HRCT in correctly screening 130 out of the 131 COVID19 pneumonia cases 992 In one case COVID19 pneumonia was excluded by both HRCT and lung US LUSCOP protocol showed optimal sensitivity and can be proposed as a simple screening tool for COVID19 pneumonia diagnosis in the context of outbreak burst areas where prompt isolation of suspected patients is crucial for patients and operators safety,The coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic outbreak, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 SARSCov2 is affecting people worldwide representing a public health emergency The effect of concomitant COVID19 on patients who underwent cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass CPB is still undefined Both SARSCov2 infection and CPB can develop a cytokines storm and haemostatic disarrangements leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS and postperfusion lung syndrome, respectively SARSCov2 infection may trigger and exacerbate postinflammatory state after CPB resulting in higher risk of postsurgical adverse outcomes International guidelines lack to provide standard management protocols for preoperative COVID19 patients requiring nondeferrable cardiac surgery intervention We present a report of a successful coronary artery bypass grafting CABG emergency operation in a COVID19 patient, who presented unstable angina and coronary artery dissection during cardiac catheterization and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty PTCA,Takotsubo syndromeTTS is attributed to catecholamine surge, which is also observed in COVID19 disease due to the cytokine storm We performed a systematic literature search using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials retrospectively to identify COVID19associated TTS case reports and evaluated patientlevel demographics, laboratory markers clinical attributes, treatment given, and outcomes There are 27 cases reported of TTS associated with COVID19 infection of which 445 were male Reported median age was 57xa0years IQR 3965 and 6295xa0years IQR 505735 in case series and individual patients cases in database, respectively The time interval from the symptom onset to TTS diagnosis was median 65xa0days IQR 1080 in case series and 67xa0days IQR 410 in individual patients database The median LVEF was 36 IQR 3537 and 3815IQR 30425—male 4033 IQR 33442 and female 3715 IQR 3040 in case series and individualpatients database, respectively Troponin was elevated in all patients except one patient 772 patients of TTS with COVID19 had an elevated Creactive protein andor Ddimer Twelve out of 22 545 patients developed cardiac complication such as cardiogenicshock, atrial fibrillation, acute heart failure, supraventricular tachycardia, and biventricular heart failure Nineteen out of 26 7307 patients were discharged, and three were hospitalized due to acute respiratory distress syndrome and needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or ongoing maternal age There were 4 148 mortality There was no major gender difference observed in development of TTS in COVID19 unlike COVID19 per se Older median age group for TTS in COVID19 patients irrespective of cardiovascular comorbidities and gender probably reflects age as an independent risk factor Patients who developed TTS had higher mortality rate especially if they developed cardiogenic shock,Introduction Acute heart failure AHF is one of the leading causes of hospital admissions and is characterized by systemic and pulmonary congestion, which often precedes the overt clinical signs and symptoms Echocardiography in the management of chronic HF is well described however, there are less evidence regarding echocardiography and lung ultrasound LUS in the acute settingAreas covered We have summarized current evidence regarding the use of echocardiography and LUS for assessing congestion in patients with AHF We discuss the value and reliability of handheldpocketsize ultrasound devices in AHFExpert opinion Echocardiography is an essential tool for the diagnostic work up in patients with AHF No individual parameter reliably detects congestion, thus the physician must integrate several measurements from the right and left heart Novel methods and advances in cardiac imaging and clinical chemistry make it possible to detect congestion at an early stage LUS is particularly helpful in assessing congestion, and it has demonstrated diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic value in AHF LUS is relatively easy to learn and allows for quick assessment of the presence of pulmonary congestion and pleural effusion We recommend integration of LUS for routine management of patients with AHF,BackgroundThe interaction between the pulmonary function and cardiovascular mechanics is a crucial issue, particularly when treating patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD Synchrogram index is a new parameter that can quantify this interaction and has the potential to apply in COPD patients Our objective in this study was to characterize cardiorespiratory interactions in terms of cardiorespiratory coupling CRC using the synchrogram index of the heart rate and respiratory flow signals in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseaseMethodsThis is a crosssectional and preliminary data from a prospective study, which examines 55 COPD patients Kmeans clustering analysis was applied to cluster COPD patients based on the synchrogram index Linear regression and multivariable regression analysis were used to determine the correlation between the synchrogram index and the exercise capacity assessed by a sixminute walking test 6MWTResultsThe 55 COPD patients were separated into a synchronized group median 089 064097, nu2009u200943 and a desynchronized group median 023 002051, nu2009u200912 based on Kmeans clustering analysis Synchrogram index was correlated significantly with six minutes walking distance ru2009u2009042, pu2009u20090001 and distance saturation product ru2009u2009041, pu2009u20090001 assessed by 6MWT, and still was an independent variable by multivariable regression analysisConclusionThis is the first result studying the heartlung interaction in terms of cardiorespiratory coupling in COPD patients by the synchrogram index, and COPD patients are clustered into synchronized and desynchronized groups Cardiorespiratory coupling is associated with exercise capacity in patients with COPD,,Dobutamine stress echocardiography DSE is sensitive but subjective diagnostic tool to detect inducible ischemia Nowadays, speckle tracking allows an objective quantification of regional wall function We aimed to investigate the feasibility and accuracy of global GLS and regional longitudinal strain RLS during DSE to detect significant coronary stenosis SCSxa0We conducted a prospective observational multicenter study including patients undergoing DSE for suspected SCS 50 patients with positive DSE underwent coronary angiography Besides visual regional wall motion score index WMSI, GLS and RLS were determined at rest and at peak stress by Automated Function Imagingxa0DSE GLS feasibility was 96 Among 35 patients with SCS, 12 patients were affected by multivessel disease, 18 had stenosis of left anterior descending artery LAD, 18 of left circumflex LCX and 15 of right coronary artery RCA At peak stress, both GLS reduction pu2009u20090037 and WMSI worsening pu2009u2009004 showed significant agreement with coronary angiography for detecting SCS When single lesion was considered, peak stress GLS and LAD RLS were lower in the obstructed LAD regions than in normoperfused territories 174u2009u200955 vs 205u2009u200944, pu2009u2009003 171u2009u200976

carried out on 95 IPF patients44 with DPO on high resolution computed tomography HRCT and 51 with no calcifications detected on HRCT Pulmonary Function Tests PFTs acquired nearest to the HRCT were collected Images were analyzed by two radiologists using a qualitative method, based on HRCT fibrosis visual score, and using a quantitative method, based on histogrambased analysis The Spearmans rank correlation coefficient was used to measure the strength and direction of the linear relationship between HRCT fibrosis score and PFTs in addition, Spearmans rank correlation coefficient was used to explore the relationships between HRCT fibrosis score and quantitative index and between quantitative indexes and PFTs A weak correlation between HRCT fibrosis score and PFTs was proven r 0014 and p  09347 for FVC Forced Vital Capacity, r  0379 and p  00174 for DLCO Carbon monoxide diffusing capacity We found a moderate negative correlation between HRCT fibrosis score and kurtosis r  0448, p  0004272 and skewness r  0463, p  0003019 and a weak positive correlation with High Attenuation Area HAA r  0362, p  00235 Moreover, a moderate linear correlation between Quantitative Indexes and FVC r  0577, p  0000051 for kurtosis and FVC, r  0598, p  0000023 for skewness and FVC, r  0519, p  00000364 for HAA and FVC and between quantitative indexes and DLCO r  0469, p  0001508 for kurtosis, and DLCO, r  0474, p  0001309 for skewness and DLCO, r  0412, p  0005996 for HAA and DLCO was revealed To better investigate the influence of DPO in disease progression, a longitudinal evaluation should be performed,BACKGROUND The most common thoracic injury in children, resulting in trauma, is pulmonary contusion PC Bone marrowderived mesenchymal stem cells BMMSCs are used in wound healing and many other diseases This study aims to examine the effects of BMMSCs on PC healing in rats MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 45 male Wistar albino rats were used Four groups were formed BMMSCs were labeled with the green fluorescent protein PC was observed in the control group In group II, PC occured and left to spontaneous healing In group III, PC formed and BMMSCs were given In group IV, BMMSCs were given without PC formation Subjects were sacrificed 1 week later Whether there was any difference in terms of BMMSC involvement and lung injury score was investigated Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences SPSS, version 170, software SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, and p value of 005 was considered statistically significant RESULTS BMMSCs were collected much more in the lungs in group III than in group IV Group III had a lower lung injury score value than group II CONCLUSION The greater involvement of the BMMSCs in the injury site, and further reductions in lung injury score suggest that BMMSCs are contributing to the healing of the injury The use of BMMSCs in risky patients with diffuse PC may be an alternative treatment to conventional methods,,,,Abstract  Background While it is understood that coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is primarily complicated by respiratory failure, more data are emerging on the cardiovascular complications of this disease A subset of COVID19 patients present with STelevations on electrocardiogram ECG yet normal coronary angiography, a presentation that can fit criteria for myocardial infarction with no obstructive coronary atherosclerosis MINOCA There is little known about noncoronary myocardial injury observed in patients with COVID19, and we present a case that should encourage further conversation and study of this clinical challenge   Case summary An 86yearold man presented to our institution with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and an ECG showing anteroseptal STsegment elevation concerning for myocardial infarction Mechanic ventilation was initiated prior to presentation, and emergent transthoracic echocardiography reported an ejection fraction of 5055, with no significant regional wall motion abnormalities Next, emergent coronary angiography was performed, and no significant coronary artery disease was detected The patient tested positive for COVID19 Despite supportive management in the intensive care unit, the patient passed away   Discussion We present a case of COVID19 that is likely associated with MINOCA It is crucial to understand that in COVID19 patients with signs of myocardial infarction, not all myocardial injury is due to obstructive coronary artery disease In the case of COVID19 pathophysiology, it is important to consider the cardiovascular effects of hypoxic respiratory failure, potential myocarditis, and significant systemic inflammation Continued surveillance and research on the cardiovascular complications of COVID19 is essential to further elucidate management and prognosis,Patients with sickle cell disease are already at high risk for respiratory complications, which SARS‐CoV‐2 can rapidly worsen The case emphasizes the importance of efficiently maximizing standard therapies in sickle cell patients with COVID‐19 Patients with sickle cell disease are already at high risk for respiratory complications, which SARS‐CoV‐2 can rapidly worsen The case emphasizes the importance of efficiently maximizing standard therapies in sickle cell patients with COVID‐19,Background Nitrous oxide N2O, laughing gas is increasingly used as a recreational drug and is presumed relatively safe and innocent It is often being used in combination with other substances, such as cannabis Case summary A young adult attended the emergency room because of chest pain after recreational use of very highdose nitrous oxide in combination with cannabis Electrocardiography demonstrated STelevation in the anterior leads Coronary angiography showed thrombus in the proximal and thrombotic occlusion of the distal left anterior descending coronary artery for which primary percutaneous coronary intervention was attempted Thrombus aspiration was unsuccessful and the patient was further treated with a glycoprotein IIbIIIa in addition to dual platelet therapy Blood results showed low vitamin B12 and folic acid status with concomitant hyperhomocysteinaemia, a known cause of hypercoagulation Transthoracic echocardiogram showed a moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction LVEF Three months later, an improvement in LVEF and no recurrent angina or symptoms of heart failure were noticed Discussion We report a case of acute myocardial infarction secondary to very highdose nitrous oxide abuse in combination with cannabis and possible hypoxia We propose that severe hyperhomocysteinaemia secondary to nitrous oxideinduced vitamin B12 deficiency together with the vasoconstrictive effects of cannabis might pose a seriously increased risk for intracoronary, among others, thrombus formation In conclusion, we contest the safety and innocence of recreational nitrous oxide abuse, notably in the context of other factors increasing the risk of coagulation,Imatinib mesilate Glivec is a wellknown antitumor target inhibitor of protein tyrosine kinase, which is effective in different cancer types expressing Bcr  Abl and, in particular, in hemoblastosis A higher interest to imatinib during the COVID19 epidemic is explained by the fact that cancer patients are one of the COVID19 risk groups Moreover, imatinib target mechanism of action, which is effective in cancer, can have a high potential against the most severe COVID19 complication such as the disease associated pulmonary fibrosis COVID19 associated interstitial pulmonary fibrosis develops as an autoimmune process caused by systemic inflammation with atypical idiopathic pneumonia resulting from acute respiratory distress syndrome with the tyrosine kinase mechanism of signaling pathway activation and cellular response Experimental and clinical results showing antifibrotic and doserelated antithrombotic imatinib effect demonstrate perspective use of this antitumor agent to correct COVID19 associated pneumonia causing a high death rate of patients with COVID19 The review presents literature data of 20012020 discussing pathologic genetic and clinical characteristics of the fibrosis which exacerbates COVID19 pneumonia in adults The sequence of the disease processes demonstrates that disease progression with the decreasing oxygen saturation in the peripheral blood intensifies local thrombosis in the lungs As a result, hypoxia is developing, which is difficult to control and can cause lethal outcome in severe cases Yet, the conventional antifibrotic and thrombolytic agents can only partially control the process of pneumofibrosis including that of cancer patients The approximate antifibrotic dose of imatinib 400 mg  day is therapeutic for oncopathology The antitumor drug registered in many countries and well described side effects and contraindications needs no longterm registration studies for a new indication, therefore, it may be easily prepared for clinical testing,There were 79 articles published in the Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance JCMR in 2019, including 65 original research papers, 2

perihilar location and can be asymptomatic They may present in early stages with only obstructive features such as mucus plugging of airways resulting in bronchocele formation We report the case of a 44year lady with no chest complaints, who underwent chest radiograph for a routine preanesthetic checkup A vertically oriented, tubular, soft tissue density lesion was observed in the right lower lung, which mimicked a Scimitar vein Scimitar syndrome is a congenital disorder in which an anomalous vein drains the middle and lower lobes of right lung and enters into the IVC most commonly It may present asymptomatically in adults and on chest radiograph appears as a vertical tubular opacity paralleling the right cardiac border However, CT angiography revealed the lung lesion to be a bronchocele, distal to a central intensely enhancing spherical mass, completely occluding the right lower lobe bronchus This perihilar mass had been missed on the chest radiograph Bronchoscopic biopsy revealed a carcinoid tumor As the patient was asymptomatic, she refused surgery in the ongoing COVID19 pandemic,BACKGROUND Use of anesthesia machines as improvised ICU ventilators may occur in locations where waste anesthesia gas suctionWAGS is unavailable Anecdotal reports suggest as much as 18 cmH2O positive endexpiratory pressurePEEP being inadvertently applied under these circumstances, accompanied by inaccurate pressure readings by the anesthesia machine We hypothesized that resistance within closed anesthetic gas scavenging systemsAGSS disconnected from WAGS may inadvertently increase circuit pressures METHODS An anesthesia machine was connected to an anesthesia breathing circuit, a reference manometer, and a standard bag reservoir to simulate a lung Ventilation was initiated as follows Volume Control, TV 500 mL, respiratory rate 12, IE 119, FiO2 10, fresh gas flowFGF rate 20 liters per minuteLPM, and PEEP 0 cmH2O After engaging the ventilator, PEEP and peak inspiratory pressurePIP were measured by the reference manometer and the anesthesia machine display simultaneously The process was repeated using prescribed PEEP levels of 5, 10, 15, and 20 cmH2O Measurements were repeated with the WAGS disconnected and then were performed again at FGF of 4, 6, 8, 10, and 15 LPM This process was completed on three anesthesia machines Dräger Perseus A500, Dräger Apollo, and the GE Avance CS2 Simple linear regression was used to assess differences RESULTS Utilizing nonparametric BlandAltman analysis, the reference and machine manometer measurements of PIP demonstrated median differences of 040 cmH2O 95LOA 100,055 for the Dräger Apollo, 040 cmH2O 95LOA 110, 041 for the Dräger Perseus, and 170 cmH2O 95LOA 080,300 for the GE Avance CS2 At FGF 2 LPM and PEEP 0 cmH2O with the WAGS disconnected, the Dräger Apollo had a difference in PEEP of 002 cmH2O 95CI 004,008 p053 the Dräger Perseus A500, 00001 cmH2O 95CI 011 011 p100 and the GE Avance CS2, 862 cmH2O 95CI 855,869 p00001 After removing the hose connected to the AGSS and the visual indicator bag on the GE Avance CS2, the PEEP difference was 012 cmH2O 95CI 0059,0181 p00002 CONCLUSIONS Displayed airway pressure measurements are clinically accurate in the setting of disconnected WAGS The Dräger Perseus A500 and Apollo with open scavenging systems do not deliver inadvertent CPAP with WAGS disconnected, but the GE Avance CS2 with a closed AGSS does This increase in airway pressure can be mitigated by the manufacturers recommended alterations Anesthesiologists should be aware of the potential clinically important increases in pressure that may be inadvertently delivered on some anesthesia machines, should the WAGS not be properly connected,Background The coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic has resulted in drastic changes to the practice of medicine, requiring healthcare systems to find solutions to reduce the risk of infection Using a case series, we propose a protocol for sameday discharge SDD for selected patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement TAVR using realtime remote cardiac monitoring Six patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis underwent TAVR and were discharged on the same day Case summary Six patients with symptomatic severe native or bioprosthetic aortic valve stenosis underwent a successful transfemoral TAVR using standard procedures, including the use of rapid atrial pacing to assess the need for permanent pacemaker implantation Following TAVR, patients were monitored on telemetry in the recovery area for 3u2009h, ambulated to assess vascular access stability, and discharged with realtime remote cardiac monitoring if no new conduction abnormality was observed The patients were seen by televisits within 2u2009days and 2u2009weeks after discharge Discussion Amidst the COVID19 pandemic, SDD following successful transfemoral TAVR may be feasible for selected patients and reduce potential COVID19 exposure,The coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 has become a deadly pandemic with surging mortality rates and no cure COVID19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 SARSCoV2 with a range of clinical symptoms, including cough, fever, chills, headache, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, and a loss of smell or taste Aged individuals with compromised immunity are highly susceptible to COVID19 and the likelihood of mortality increases with age and the presence of comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Emerging evidence suggests that COVID19 highjacks mitochondria of immune cells, replicates within mitochondrial structures, and impairs mitochondrial dynamics leading to cell death Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell and are largely involved in maintaining cell immunity, homeostasis, and cell survivaldeath Increasing evidence suggests that mitochondria from COVID19 infected cells are highly vulnerable, and vulnerability increases with age The purpose of our article is to summarize the role of various agerelated comorbidities such as diabetes, obesity, and neurological diseases in increasing mortality rates amongst the elderly with COVID19 Our article also highlights the interaction between coronavirus and mitochondrial dynamics in immune cells We also highlight the current treatments, lifestyles, and safety measures that can help protect against COVID19 Further research is urgently needed to understand the molecular mechanisms between the mitochondrial virus and disease progression in COVID19 patients,,SARSCoV2 is primarily a respiratory disease however, there have been multiple reports of associated myocarditis In our 463 bedded, district general hospital, we noted an influx of young patients with myocarditis shortly after the peak of the outbreak We report two cases presenting with myocarditis, both of whom tested negative for the virus despite clinical and biochemical evidence of recent infection Diagnosis was made based on positive transthoracic echocardiogram TTE findings and a raised troponin, not in the context of suspected acute coronary syndrome We recommend that patients with negative coronavirus tests should still be considered at risk of potential sequelae from the disease There should be a low threshold for performing basic cardiac investigations ECG, troponin and TTE as well as seeking a cardiology opinion Colchicine is a recognised treatment for viral pericarditis and should be considered as adjunctive treatment however, further research is required specific to SARSCoV2,To assess the impact of COVID19 restrictions on cystic fibrosis CF pulmonary exacerbations PEx we performed a retrospective review of PEx events at our CF Center and compared the rate of PEx in 2019 versus 2020 Restrictions on social interaction due to the COVID19 pandemic were associated with a lower number of PEx events at our pediatric CF Center, suggesting that these restrictions also reduced exposure to other respiratory viral infection in children with CF,Backgroundxa0Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID19 is an ongoing major global health crisis caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 The outcomes of COVID19 in patients remain unclear We aimed to identify risk factors for the mortality of COVID19 in the Republic of Korea without health system disruptionMethods The data of confirmed COVID19 patients were retrieved from Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service HIRA dataset between January 3 and June 1, 2020 We used multivariable logistic regression models to identify risk factors for mortality in patients with COVID19Results We identified 7,333 COVID19 patients, of whom 227 31 died Hypertension was the most common 26, followed by diabetes mellitus 230 In multivariate analysis, male OR 192, P 00001, elderly age 65 OR 1100, P  00001, living in a large outbreak area OR 261, P  00001, Medical Aid beneficiaries OR 154, P  00282, Charlson Comorbidity Index CCI score 3 OR 325, P  0029, hypertension OR 190, P  00013, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD OR 161, P  00374, congestive heart failure CHF OR 214, P  00001, and endstage renal disease ESRD OR 569, P  00090 were independent risk factors associated with mortality in COVID19 patients However, diabetes mellitus, liver cirrhosis, and inflammatory bowel disease were not risk factors for mortalityConclusionxa0xa0xa0Male, elderly patients ˃65 years old, Medical Aid beneficiaries, higher CCI 3, and living in a large outbreak area might have a greater risk of mortality and comorbidities such as hypertension, COPD, CHF, and ESRD could also greatly affect the mortality in COVID19 patients,Epithelial characteristics underlying the differential susceptibility of chronic asthma to SARSCoV2 COVID19 and other viral infections are currently unclear By revisiting transcriptomic data from patients with Th2 low versus Th2 high asthma, as well as mild, moderate and severe asthmatics, we characterized the changes in expression of human coronavirus and influenza viral entry genes relative to sex, airway location and disease endotype We found sexual dimorphism in expression of COVID19 genes ACE2, TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, and SLC6A19 ACE2 receptor downregulation occurred specifically in females in Th2 high asthma, while proteases broadly assisting coronavirus and influenza viral entry, TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4, were highly upregulated in both sexes Overall, changes in COVID19 gene expression were specific to Th2 high molecular endotype of asthma, and different by asthma severity and airway location The downregulation of ACE2 COVID19, SARS and ANPEP HCoV229E viral receptors correlated with loss of club and ciliated cells in Th2 high asthma, while the increase in DPP4 MERSCoV, ST3GAL4, and ST6GAL1 influenza associated with an increase in goblet and basal activated cells Overall, this study elucidates sex, airway location, disease endotype and changes in epithelial heterogeneity as factors underlying asthmatic susceptibility, or lack thereof, to COVID19,In the acute cardiac care setting, undifferentiated clinical presentations such as dyspnea, chest pain, shock, and cardiac arrest are common diagnostic challenges for the clinician Lung ultrasonography is a wellestablished diagnostic tool which can be integrated in simplified decision making algorithms during the initial approach of the patient, in order to differentiate accurately cardiac from noncardiac causes and improve the management of timesensitive cardiovascular emergencies,A 53yearold man with diabetes came to the emergency department with fever and dry cough for 5u2009days, swelling of the left leg for 2u2009days, shortness of breath and chest pain for 1u2009hour He had raised temperature, tachycardia, tachypnoea, reduced oxygen saturation and swollen tender left leg on examination The frontal chest radiograph showed bilateral groundglass opacities he tested positive for COVID19 with elevated Ddimer The colour Doppler examination of the left leg revealed acute deep vein thrombosis DVT of the common femoral and the popliteal veins The chest CT showed bilateral diffuse groundglass opacities predominantly involving peripheral zones and the lower lobes The CTPA revealed left pulmonary thromboembolism PTE, treated with lowmolecularweight heparin COVID19 predominantly affects the respiratory system DVT and PTE are common in COVID19 but lethal They should be diagnosed early by clinical and radiological examinations and treated promptly with anticoagulants,Coronavirus disease2019 has created unprecedented challenges for society, and specifically the medical community While the pandemic continues to unfold, the transplant community has had to pivot to keep recipients, donors, and institutional transplant teams safe given the unique circumstances inherent to solid organ transplantation,COVID19 is a rapidly growing pandemic with its first case identified during December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China Due to the rampant rise in the number of cases in China and globally, WHO declared COVID19 as a pandemic on 11th March 2020 The disease is transmitted via respiratory droplets of infected patients during coughing or sneezing and affects primarily the lung parenchyma The spectrum of clinical manifestations can be seen in COVID19 patients ranging from asymptomatic infections to severe disease resulting in mortality Although respiratory involvement is most common in COVID19 patients, the virus can affect other organ systems as well The systemic inflammation induced by the disease along with multisystem expression of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 ACE2, a receptor which allows viral entry into cells, explains the manifestation of extrapulmonary symptoms affecting the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hematological, renal, musculoskeletal, and endocrine system Here, we have reviewed the extensive literature available on COVID19 about various clinical presentations based on the organ system involved as well as clinical presentation in specific population including children, pregnant women, and immunocompromised patients We have also briefly discussed about the Multisystemic Inflammatory Syndrome occurring in children and adults with COVID19 Understanding the various clinical presentations can help clinicians diagnose COVID19 in an early stage and ensure appropriate measures to be undertaken in order to prevent further spread of the disease,BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 primarily affects the lungs but can involve any organ The medical community is struggling to cope with the critical illness associated with the disease On top of that, patients who have recovered from COVID19 have presented with complications such as thrombotic episodes in various organs both during and after being infected with SARSCoV2 A COVID19associated prothrombotic state has been mentioned in multiple recent research articles The role of anticoagulants is debatable, because even after receiving them prophylactically, many patients have experienced thrombotic episodes The situation, therefore, represents a challenge to the medical community CASE REPORT We report on a COVID19associated prothrombotic state in a 65yearold man with no history of comorbid illness Initially, he presented with rightsided weakness and was found to have had an acute ischemic stroke Urgent imaging after the stroke revealed changes on electrocardiography that were remarkable for left bundle branch block The patients elevated cardiac enzyme levels correlated with a silent acute myocardial infarction MI His echocardiogram revealed a left ventricular LV thrombus He was managed with a multidisciplinary approach involving Neurology, Cardiology, and Medicine CONCLUSIONS COVID19associated prothrombotic episodes involving arterial and venous systems have been reported in the literature But concomitant stroke, acute MI, and LV thrombus rarely have been documented The role of prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation is still unclear because even when patients are on these drugs, they continue to develop thrombotic episodes Indeed, further studies are required to develop a standard management plan for what can be a fatal situation,BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is an infectious disease that leads to critical respiratory problems Obstructive sleep apnea OSA is the most common sleepassociated breathing disease and is represented by repetitive experiences of constraint of the respiratory tract prompting to reduced or deficient breathing during sleep AutoContinuous positive airway pressure AutoCPAP is a modality of respiratory ventilation used as gold standart in the treatment of OSA OBJECTIVE This study was performed to conclude the alteration of AutoCPAP levels in OSA patients who had COVID19 history METHODS Nineteen OSA patients who had cured COVID19 and used AutoCPAP were included in this study Nightly AutoCPAP 95th percentile pressure 95thpp, median CPAP pressure and AHI before COVID19 disease and one month after COVID therapy were recorded from electronic cards of AutoCPAP devices RESULTS Before COVID infection, average AutoCPAP 95thpp was 856xa0xa0017 cm H2O One month after COVID19, average AutoCPAP 95thpp was 978xa0xa0021 cm H2O P,,Purpose of ReviewGiant cell arteritis GCA, a medium and large vessel vasculitis occurring in the aged, remains a formidable disease, capable of taking both vision and life, through a multitude of vascular complications Our understanding of the spectrum of its manifestations has grown over the years, to include limb claudication, aortitis, and cardiac disease, in addition to the more classic visual complications resulting from of ischemia to branches of the external and internal carotid arteries While a clinical presentation of headache, jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, fever and other systemic symptoms and serum markers are together highly suggestive of the disease, diagnosis can be challenging in those cases in which classic symptoms are lacking The purpose of this review is to update the reader on advances in the diagnosis and treatment of giant cell arteritis and to review our evolving understanding of the immunological mechanism underlying the disease, which have helped guide our search for novel therapiesRecent FindingsThere is increasing evidence supporting the use of Doppler ultrasound, dedicated postcontrast T1weighted spin echo MRI of the scalp arteries and PET scan, which can together improve our diagnostic accuracy in cases in which temporal artery biopsy is either inconclusive or not feasible Advances in our understanding of the immunological cascades underlying the disease have helped guide our search for steroidsparing treatments for the GCA, the most important of which has been the IL6 receptor antibody inhibitor tocilizumab, which has been shown to reduce cumulative steroid dose in a large multicenter, placebocontrolled prospective study Other biologic agents, such as abatacept and ustekinumab have shown promise in smaller studiesSummaryGCA is no longer a disease whose diagnosis is based exclusively on temporal artery biopsy and whose complications are prevented solely with the use of corticosteroids Modern vascular imaging techniques and targeted immunologic therapies are heralding a new era for the disease, in which practitioners will hopefully be able to diagnosis it with greater accuracy and treat it with less ischemic complications and iatrogenic side effects,Purpose of the reviewDespite advancements in the diagnostic and therapeutic armamentarium, heart failure HF remains a major public health concern in the USA and worldwide Digital health applications hold promise to bridge this gap and improve HF care This review will provide the reader with a concise overview of the current digital health applications in HF, the main challenges to its use, and discuss the future of digital health for promoting care for HF patientsRecent findingsEmerging evidence continues to support the potential role of digital health across the continuum of HF disease process including primary prevention, early detection, disease management, and reducing associated morbidity There is also increasing emphasis on the need to pursue rigorous investigations to validate these promising claims, with some successful stories that have changed clinical practicesSummaryDigital health technologies have emerged as potentially useful tools to complement HF care in both research and clinical realms As digital technologies continue to play an increasing role in transforming healthcare delivery, creating the framework for its effective use would be necessary to ensure that digital health applications consistently improve outcomes and enhance care for HF patients,Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 It has been declared as a pandemic on March 11th 2020 by the WHO Morbidity and mortality of COVID19 has been shown to be high among patients with underlying diseases In this narrative review, searching a number of electronic databases PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Science Direct, 127 related articles written in English were retrieved and of which 73 articles related to risk factors affecting morbidity and mortality of COVID19 were extracted and summarized Factors such as old age, male gender and working in health setting were associated with higher morbidity and mortality Hypertension was the most frequent reported condition among those with severe disease It also appeared to increase the mortality and duration of hospitalization Diabetes, respiratory chronic illnesses COPD, asthma, impaired liver and renal function, and malignancies were also mentioned as the risk factors for severe disease, longer hospitalization, poor prognosis and outcome Some laboratory findings such as elevated Ddimer, CRP, and LDH as well as severe lymphopenia were associated with severity, mortality and poor outcomes in hospitalized patients All in all, a considerable number of comorbidities and biomarkers are associated with severity and presentations of COVID19 disease, affecting its morbidity and mortality rates,Giant coronary aneurysms are late sequelae of Kawasaki disease KD We describe a 53yearold patient who presented with acute myocardial infarction and proximal aneurysms of all three coronary arteries Coronary angiography demonstrated the aneurysms, but CT angiography allowed accurate assessment of the real dimensions of the aneurysms and making the decision on the preferred method of revascularization The patient underwent coronary bypass surgery and is asymptomatic at followup,Introduction Hypertension is a modifiable risk factor for multiple cardiovascular diseases Early identification and intervention of new cases are crucial to improve patients outcomes May Measurement Month MMM is an annual global synchronised blood pressure BP screening campaign Participants can have their BP measured at the screening sites It may be a possible way to identify undiagnosed hypertensive patients in the population Methods It was a crosssectional study of BP among Hong Kong adults Multiple screening sites were set in local community pharmacies and on the campus of the Chinese University of Hong Kong Participants were asked to fill in a questionnaire regarding their demographics, medical history, and social history Then, they took at least one BP reading using an automated sphygmomanometer after sitting at for 5 minutes Up to three BP readings were taken and recorded for each participant, with oneminute intervals between readings Results A total of 3224 adults participated in MMM between 2017 and 2019 The average BP among the 3224 participants was 1398755u2009mmHg The prevalence of hypertension was 2282 708, of which 635 278 were undiagnosed before MMM Among the 1647 participants previously diagnosed with hypertension, 1007 611 had uncontrolled hypertension Conclusion A high number of cases can be identified with untreated, or treated but uncontrolled, hypertension from MMM Citizens should be encouraged to check BP regularly and take followup actions if hypertension is suspected,,Objective To evaluate acute pulmonary embolism in patients with 2019 novel coronavirus COVID19 pneumonia using pulmonary CT angiography Subjects and Methods From 95 symptomatic patients confirmed with COVID19 by RTPCR from 1 May to 14 July 2020 in Dallah Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, CT angiography was done for 25 patients suspected to have pulmonary embolism and have no contraindication for contrast study 11 cases of them showed CT evidence of acute pulmonary embolism PE Retrospectively, CT angiography was analyzed and detailed findings were recorded This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of our hospital, and the patient consent was waived Results The mean age of the included patients was 49u2009u200911 years the youngest was 22 years, and the oldest was 64 years Common symptoms in the 25 cases that underwent CT angiography were fever that was noted in 2125 cases 84, shortness of breath in 1825 cases 72, cough in 1625 cases 64, and severe myalgiabody fatigue in 1325 cases 52 The less common symptoms were sore throat in 1125 cases 44 and headache in 1025 cases 40 Regarding CT findings, 425 cases 16 had unilateral lung disease and 2125 cases 84 had bilateral disease, with slight predilection for the right lower lobe 1025 cases, 40 Pure groundglass opacity GGO was seen in 1325 cases 52, and GGO with consolidation was seen in 1225 cases 48 Common accompanying CT signs included crazy paving stone sign in 1525 cases 60 and air bronchogram in 1225 cases 48 From the 25 patients that showed respiratory deterioration and elevated serum Ddimer level, 11 cases confirmed to have acute pulmonary embolism, while 14 cases showed negative result for pulmonary embolism 611 were male and 511 were female Pulmonary embolism was diagnosed at a mean of 21 days from symptom onset Unilateral acute pulmonary embolism was seen in 311 cases, while 811 cases showed bilateral distribution Among 11 cases with acute pulmonary embolism, no emboli at the central level could be seen, but 3 cases showed pulmonary embolism at the lobar level, 3 cases at the segmental level, and 5 cases at lobar, segmental, and subsegmental levels Conclusion In patients with confirmed COVID19, we should maintain a high suspicion for its thromboembolic complications such as acute pulmonary embolism that was mainly diagnosed at the end of 3rd week from symptom onset We suggest that whenever a CT evaluation of the parenchymal involvement of COVID19 pneumonia is performed, a simultaneous evaluation of the pulmonary arteries is also essential in order to identify early signs of associated pulmonary embolism,•COVID19 infection is associated with a prothrombotic state•Point of care ultrasound POCUS provides prompt bedside diagnosis of covid19 complications such as clot in transit•Bedside TEE guidance of mechanical CPR arm placement improves the efficiency of chest compressions,Nigella sativa N sativa seed had been used traditionally due to several pharmacological effects The updated experimental and clinical effects of N sativa and its constituents on respiratory, allergic and immunologic disorders are provided in this comprehensive review article Various databases including PubMed, Science Direct and Scopus were used The preventive effects of N sativa on pulmonary diseases were mainly due to its constituents such as thymoquinone, thymol, carvacrol and alphahederin Extracts and constituents of N sativa showed the relaxant effect, with possible mechanisms indicating its bronchodilatory effect in obstructive pulmonary diseases In experimental animal models of different respiratory diseases, the preventive effect of various extracts and constituents of N sativa was demonstrated by mechanisms such as antioxidant, immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory effects Bronchodilatory and preventive effects of the plant and its components on asthma, COPD and lung disorders due to exposure to noxious agents as well as on allergic and immunologic disorders were also shown in the clinical studies Various extracts and constituents of N sativa showed pharmacological and therapeutic effects on respiratory, allergic and immunologic disorders indicating possible remedy effect of that the plant and its effective substances in treating respiratory, allergic and immunologic diseases,The 4th Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction has stimulated considerable debate since its publication in 2018 The intention was to define the types of myocardial injury through the lens of their underpinning pathophysiology In this review, we discuss how the 4th Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction defines infarction and injury and the necessary pragmatic adjustments that appear in clinical guidelines to maximize triage of realworld patients,Four out of five deaths from cardiovascular disease are due to heart attacks and strokes in low and middleincome countries Early identification of risk factors in exposed individuals will help to develop interventions that may eliminate andor reduce these risks and prevent the development of cardiovascular diseases So, it is necessary to investigate the risk of impaired cardiovascular function in university students due to the increase in some risk factors and cardiovascular events in young adults, and to describe its epidemiology among international university students For this, an observational crosssectional study through interviews is designed The clinical validity was addressed following the Fehring model In addition, anthropometric data and results of laboratory tests were collected The nursing diagnosis Risk of impaired cardiovascular function showed clinical validity, high sensitivity and specificity, as well as predictive values Fehring ratio values were above 079 and Kappa Index above 072 The study showed a high frequency of this nursing diagnosis among university students, especially in students of Brazilian nationality The main risks of impaired cardiovascular function found in 868 of students were family history of cardiovascular disease, sedentary lifestyle, pharmacological agent, dyslipidemia, and insufficient knowledge The most prevalent risk factors of the nursing diagnosis in the studied population were related to insufficient knowledge of modifiable health habits, such as sedentary lifestyle The information provided is expected to serve as the basis for the planning and implementation of health actions aimed at reducing modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease,,INTRODUCTION Blood transfusion and anaemia are frequent and are associated with poor outcomes in patients with hip fracture HF We hypothesised that preoperative intravenous iron and tranexamic acid TXA may reduce the transfusion rate in these patients METHODS AND ANALYSIS The HiFIT study is a multicentre, 2×2 factorial, randomised, doubleblinded, controlled trial evaluating the effect of iron isomaltoside IIM 20 mgkg vs placebo and of TXA intravenously at inclusion and topically during surgery versus placebo on transfusion rate during hospitalisation, in patients undergoing emergency surgery for HF and having a preoperative haemoglobin between 95 and 130u2009gL 780 patients are expected The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients receiving an allogenic blood transfusion of packed red blood cells from the day of surgery until hospital discharge or until D30 if patient is still hospitalised Enrolment started on March 2017 in 11 French hospitals The study was stopped between July 2017 and August 2018 because of investigation of serious AEs with IIM in Spain and slowed down since March 2020 COVID19 crisis The expected date of final followup is May 2022 Analyses of the intenttotreat and perprotocol populations are planned ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The HiFIT trial protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Comité de Protection des Personnes Ouest II and the French authorities ANSM It will be carried out according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines The results will be disseminated through presentation at scientific conferences and publication in peerreviewed journals The HiFIT trial will be the largest study evaluating iron and TXA in patients with HF TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER clinicalTrialsgov identifier NCT02972294 EudraCT Number 201600308740,The mechanisms of COVID19associated coagulopathy CAC are complex and differ in many ways from the standard mechanisms of thrombosis in critically ill patients This review presents the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and comparison of various types of coagulopathy with SAS During COVID19 infection, the number of sudden deaths outside the hospital increased One possible reason is the high incidence of serious thrombotic events in patients with COVID19 However, the pathogenesis of these lifethreatening events is multifactorial and requires independent discussion Deviations in laboratory studies of the hemostatic system in patients infected with SARSCoV2 with a severe course indicate the activation of the blood coagulation system corresponding to sepsisinduced coagulopathy SIC or DIC However, hemostasis disorders in COVID19 have characteristics that distinguish them from DIC in sepsis The clinical and laboratory features of CAC overlap with hemophagocytic syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome, and thrombotic microangiopathy The review presents data on their similarities and differences Inadequate diagnosis or inadequate treatment of hypercoagulability may explain the high incidence of unexplained deaths from COVID19 They can be associated with potentially preventable microvascular and macrovascular thrombosis and subsequent cardiovascular complications, including myocardial injury and infarction, as well as insufficient information content of biomarkers for their assessment Research to identify the most informative biomarkers for decisionmaking to intensify anticoagulant prophylaxis in patients with severe COVID19 is progressing rapidly, with increasing focus on TEG and ROTEM The review presents changes in CAC during hormone therapy for COVID19associated lung damage Pulse therapy with high doses of GCS has a rapid antiinflammatory effect, but at the same time increases the level of Ddimer, which increases the risk of venous thrombosis and thromboembolism,BACKGROUND The prevalence and prognostic value of chronic heart failure CHF in the setting of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 infection has seldom been studied The aim of this study was to analyze the prevalence and prognosis of CHF in this setting METHODS This singlecenter study included 829 consecutive patients with SARSCoV2 infection from February to April 2020 Patients with a previous history of CHF were matched 12 for age and sex We analyze the prognostic value of preexisting CHF Prognostic implications of N terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide NTproBNP levels on admission in the CHF cohort were explored RESULTS A total of 129 patients 43 CHF and 86 nonCHF where finally included Allcause mortality was higher in CHF patients compared to nonCHF patients 512 vs 291, p  0014 CHF was independently associated with 30day mortality hazard ratio HR 23, confidence interval CI 95 12624 Patients with CHF and highsensitivity troponin T  14 ngL showed excellent prognosis An NTproBNP level  2598 pgmL on admission was associated with higher 30day mortality in patients with CHF CONCLUSIONS Allcause mortality in CHF patients hospitalized due to SARSCoV2 infection was 512 CHF was independently associated with allcause mortality HR 23, CI 95 12642 NTproBNP levels could be used for stratification risk purposes to guide medical decisions if larger studies confirm this finding,,In March 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 caused by SARSCoV2 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization WHO The clinical course of the disease is unpredictable but may lead to severe acute respiratory infection SARI and pneumonia leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS It has been shown that pulmonary fibrosis may be one of the major longterm complications of COVID19 In animal models, the use of spironolactone was proven to be an important drug in the prevention of pulmonary fibrosis Through its dual action as a mineralocorticoid receptor MR antagonist and an androgenic inhibitor, spironolactone can provide significant benefits concerning COVID19 infection The primary effect of spironolactone in reducing pulmonary edema may also be beneficial in COVID19 ARDS Spironolactone is a wellknown, widely used and safe antihypertensive and antiandrogenic medication It has potassiumsparing diuretic action by antagonizing mineralocorticoid receptors MRs Spironolactone and potassium canrenoate, exerting combined pleiotropic action, may provide a therapeutic benefit to patients with COVID19 pneumonia through antiandrogen, MR blocking, antifibrotic and antihyperinflammatory action It has been proposed that spironolactone may prevent acute lung injury in COVID19 infection due to its pleiotropic effects with favorable reninangiotensinaldosterone system RAAS and ACE2 expression, reduction in transmembrane serine protease 2 TMPRSS2 activity and antiandrogenic action, and therefore it may prove to act as additional protection for patients at highest risk of severe pneumonia Future prospective clinical trials are warranted to evaluate its therapeutic potential,Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 infection has been associated with variousxa0complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney failure, myocardial infection, and thromboembolism Cold agglutinin syndrome CAS hasxa0been associated with other viral infections such as EpsteinBarr virus EBV, but there have been only a few reportsxa0of cold agglutination associated with COVID19 In this report, we describe a case of transient cold agglutinin elevation in a COVID19infected patient A 61yearold man with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and endstage renal disease ESRD presented with shortness of breath, cough, and lethargy for five days A clinical diagnosis of COVID19 infection was made The COVID19 RNA qualitative realtime polymerasechainreaction PCR assay tested positive During the hospital stay, he had progressive dyspnea requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation During the third week of hospital stay, an acute drop in the hemoglobin Hb level to 45 gdl baseline Hb 9 gdl was observed The workup for acute anemia revealed a positive result for cold agglutinins, direct antibody test C3d, and agglutination of the red blood cells were apparent on the peripheral blood smear Further, cold agglutinin titers peaked during the third week of the onset of illness and significantly declined during the fifth week These observational findings indicate that cold agglutinin titers might correlate with the disease activity,The coronavirus infection, COVID19, caused by SARSCoV2 is associated not only with a wide range of respiratory syndromes, but also with a pronounced destructive effect on the blood vessels of the whole body Age and concomitant pathology predispose to a more severe course of the disease Endothelial damage, widespread vasculitis and thrombosis can be distinguished as general nonspecific pathomorphological changes developing in blood vessels under the influence of SARSCoV2 For the blood vessels of the lungs, in addition to alteration of the endothelium and thrombosis, angiogenesis of the cleaving invagination type was typical The general mechanism of alteration of blood vessels and the development of vasculopathy is the direct cytopathic effect of the virus on endotheliocytes and immunemediated damage to the endothelium, manifested by the development of endotheliitis, destruction of intercellular contacts of endothelial cells, their swelling and separation from the basement membrane, accompanied by endo and perivascular inflammation Molecular biological mechanisms of virus invasion involve various ways of its penetration into the cell and various forms of development of the inflammatory response with the participation of innate and acquired immunity reactions,Acute lung immunity to inhaled pathogens elicits defensive pneumonitis that may convert to the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ARDS, causing high mortality Mechanisms underlying the conversion are not understood, but are of intense interest because of the ARDSinduced mortality in the ongoing Covid19 pandemic Here, by optical imaging of live lungs we show that key to the lethality is the functional status of mitochondrial Ca2 buffering across the mitochondrial Ca2 uniporter MCU in the alveolar type 2 cells AT2, which protect alveolar stability In mice subjected to ARDS by airway exposure to lipopolysaccharide LPS, or to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, there was marked loss of MCU expression in AT2 The ability of mice to survive ARDS depended on the extent to which the MCU expression recovered, indicating that the viability of Ca2 buffering by AT2 mitochondria critically determines ARDS severity Mitochondrial transfer to enhance AT2 MCU expression might protect against ARDS,Cardiovascular complication is one of the significant causes of death in diabetic mellitus DM in which diabetic cardiomyopathy, independent of hypertension, cardiac valvular disease, and coronary atherosclerosis, occupies an important position Although the detailed pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy remains unclear currently, mitochondrial morphological abnormality and dysfunction were observed in diabetic cardiomyopathy animal models according to much research, suggesting that mitochondrial structural and functional impairment played an integral role in the formation of diabetic cardiomyopathy Thus, we have summarized the effect of mitochondria on the process of diabetic cardiomyopathy, including abnormal mitochondrial morphology, mitochondrial energy metabolism disorder, enhanced mitochondrial oxidative stress, mitochondrial unbalanced calcium homeostasis, and mitochondrial autophagy Based on the above mechanisms and the related evidence, more therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondria in diabetic cardiomyopathy have been and will be proposed to delay the progression of the disease,The coronary care unit by Santa Izabel Hospital Salvador, Bahia, Brazil made a comparison of admitted patients with coronary disease cases admitted between two equivalent periods ranging from April through July in 2019 and 2020 There was a striking reduction in 2020 of cases of STelevation myocardial infarction 39 nonST elevation myocardial infarction 19 and unstable angina pectoris 21 This occurred in parallel with what happened in many parts of the world and hampered offering the best treatment strategy to these patients with an acute coronary syndrome such as invasive stratification and myocardial revascularization,Scholars argue that the science of science studies have to investigate the critical role of exogenous events in the emergence of new research fields The goal of this study is to analyze and explain the birth and growth of new research fields driven by exogenous event to science, such as COVID19 Coronavirus disease 2019 global pandemic crisis This study here analyzes how the novel research field of COVID19 emerges, in a comparative analysis with other scientific fields concerning respiratory illnesses eg, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, COPD and Lung Cancer, to explain factors determining the unique dynamics of science that is generating scientific breakthroughs in a short period of time The origin and evolution of the research field of COVID19 reveal that has an acceleration of scientific production equal to a growth of 171 daily in 2020, laying the foundations for science advances and a likely paradigm shift in the treatment of infectious diseases with novel mRNA vaccines Main results are generalized in properties that clarify the dynamics of science and explain the characteristics that generate the origin and evolution of new research fields driven by unforeseen crises with critical implications for technological and social change directed scientific progress of human societies,During the COVID19 epidemic, the prevalence of the disease means that practically any lung opacity on an Xray could represent pneumonia due to infection with SARSCoV2 Nevertheless, atypical radiologic findings add weight to negative microbiological or serological tests Likewise, outside the epidemic wave and with the return of other respiratory diseases, radiologists can play an important role in decision making about diagnoses, treatment, or preventive measures isolation, provided they know the key findings for entities that can simulate COVID19 pneumonia Unifocal opacities or opacities located in upper lung fields and predominant airway involvement, in addition to other key radiologic and clinical findings detailed in this paper, make it necessary to widen the spectrum of possible diagnoses,The coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 outbreak has devastated the healthcare systems and economies of over 200 countries in just a few months The etiological agent of COVID19, SARSCoV2, is a highly contagious virus that can be transmitted by asymptomatic and symptomatic carriers alike While in vitro testing techniques have allowed for populationwide screening, prognostic tools are required to assess the disease severity and therapeutic response, contributing to improve the patient clinical outcomes Moreover, no specific antiviral against COVID19 exists at the time of publication, severely limiting treatment against the infection Hence, there is an urgent clinical need for innovative therapeutic strategies that may contribute to manage the COVID19 outbreak and prevent future pandemics Herein, we critically examine recent diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic advancements for COVID19 in the field of radiopharmaceuticals First, we summarize the gold standard techniques used to diagnose COVID19, including in vitro assays and imaging techniques, and then discuss how radionuclidebased nuclear imaging provides complementary information for prognosis and treatment management of infected patients Second, we introduce new emerging types of radiotherapies that employ radioimmunoconjugates, which have shown selective cytotoxic response in oncological studies, and critically analyze how these compounds could be used as therapeutic agents against SARSCoV2 Finally, this Perspective further discusses the emerging applications of radionuclides to study the behavior of pulmonary SARSCoV2 aerosol particles,Information on outcomes of COVID19 in pulmonary arterial hypertension PAH patients is limited to a few case series and surveys Here, we describe our experience at a large Pulmonary Hypertension Center in New York City at the height of the pandemic We performed a retrospective chart review of eleven consecutive PAH patients who were diagnosed with SARSCoV2 infection We analyzed demographics, PAH severity, risk factors for COVID19, and COVID19 severity and outcomes We found in our sample that 636 of patients required intensive care, and there was a 4545 overall mortality Most patients had a known COVID19 contact and mean duration of symptoms prior to presentation was 12 days Only 411 36 patients presented to a center with pulmonary hypertension expertise, all of whom survived Most patients had at least moderate pulmonary hypertension with an average REVEAL score of 781 despite double or triple PAH therapy Our cases series underscores the gravity of SARSCoV2 infection in patients with PAH It also suggests possible interventions to prevent unfavorable outcomes such as preserving social distancing, PAH management optimization, and early and preferential presentation to a center with specialized expertise in PAH,,IntroductionAntisynthetase syndrome ASSD is a rare autoimmune condition that can present as interstitial lung disease ILD and progress into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ARDS ImportanceThe purpose of this clinical case is to highlight the importance of considering less prevalent causes of ARDS amid the COVID19 pandemic Case reportWe present a 56yearold Belgian female of African descent without past medical history who demonstrated typical signs of COVID19 at the start of the pandemic Based on the disease course as well as CTscan findings, a diagnosis of COVID19 was made She progressed to ARDS for which she got intubated and was started on venovenous membrane oxygenation VVECMO Despite initial negative screening for antinuclear antibodies, further analysis revealed antiJoantibodies Diagnosis of ASSD was eventually retained and immunosuppressive therapy was started However, pulmonary fibrosis had evolved too far and therapy was halted shortly after,Hypoxia and inflammation often coincide in pathogenic conditions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS and chronic lung diseases, which are significant contributors to morbidity and mortality for the general population For example, the recent global outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 has placed viral infectioninduced ARDS under the spotlight Moreover, chronic lung disease ranks the third leading cause of death in the United States Hypoxia signaling plays a diverse role in both acute and chronic lung inflammation, which could partially be explained by the divergent function of downstream target pathways such as adenosine signaling Particularly, hypoxia signaling activates adenosine signaling to inhibit the inflammatory response in ARDS, while in chronic lung diseases, it promotes inflammation and tissue injury In this review, we discuss the role of adenosine at the interphase of hypoxia and inflammation in ARDS and chronic lung diseases, as well as the current strategy for therapeutic targeting of the adenosine signaling pathway,Horizon Europe is a major stakeholder in the immediate future of lung research As such, we believe it is worthwhile drawing the attention of the European Respiratory Journal readership to the recent publication by Hynes et al 1 on Advanced Nonanimal Models in Biomedical Research Respiratory Tract Diseases This report from the European Commissions Joint Research Centre EU Reference Laboratory EURL ECVAM, and its accompanying dataset 2, identifies wellestablished current and emerging in vitro, in silico and ex vivo nonanimal models for respiratory disease modelling, and reinforces the concept of reduce, refine, or replace animals used for scientific purposes The 3R approach is not only embraced by the European Commission, but also the respiratory research community, as evidenced by many European Respiratory Society publications as well as frequent ERS Congress sessions and research seminars on the topic A recent report from the European Commission highlights strategies for the development of safe and efficacious therapies for respiratory diseases, especially those that exploit nonanimal methods and recapitulate the mechanistic basis of human disease httpsbitly2Vk3xfA,SARSCoV2, the virus responsible for the global coronavirus disease COVID19 pandemic, attacks multiple organs of the human body by binding to angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2 to enter cells More than 20 million people have already been infected by the virus ACE2 is not only a functional receptor of COVID19 but also an important endogenous antagonist of the reninangiotensin system RAS A large number of studies have shown that ACE2 can reverse myocardial injury in various cardiovascular diseases CVDs as well as is exert antiinflammatory, antioxidant, antiapoptotic and anticardiomyocyte fibrosis effects by regulating transforming growth factor beta, mitogenactivated protein kinases, calcium ions in cells and other major pathways The ACE2angiotensin17Mas receptor axis plays a decisive role in the cardiovascular system to combat the negative effects of the ACEangiotensin IIangiotensin II type 1 receptor axis However, the underlying mechanism of ACE2 in cardiac protection remains unclear Some approaches for enhancing ACE2 expression in CVDs have been suggested, which may provide targets for the development of novel clinical therapies In this review, we aimed to identify and summarize the role of ACE2 in CVDs,BACKGROUND Corona virus disease 2019 COVID19 is a multisystemic illness that can present with cardiac complications This report describes the preliminary findings of cardiac manifestations seen in patients managed in three centres in Lagos, Nigeria METHODS Ten patients, part of an ongoing study of patients admitted in three centres in Lagos, Nigeria, with COVID19 diagnosed with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction RTPCR or serology were retrospectively studied for cardiac manifestations RESULTS The mean SD age was 525  1879 years with a minimum of 17 years and maximum of 79 years Six patients were female and four were male Hypertension was seen in 70, diabetes in 50 and obesity in 60 of patients All had elevated inflammatory markers Only four patients had bilateral pneumonia The rest had only cardiac manifestations Six patients presented with de novo heart failure and one had decompensated heart failure A set of three patients had individually fulminant myocarditis, probable pulmonary embolism and stress cardiomyopathy, respectively CONCLUSIONS This study shows that comorbidities are common in patients with COVID19 and cardiac complications The array of cardiac complications is large, with the commonest being heart failure,The impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 on diastolic function is less known We describe a 46yearold man with a history of mild hypertension who presented to the emergency department with fever, cough, and myalgia for 2xa0days The patient was tested positive for SARSCoV2 He was admitted and started on a combination of antiviral and antimicrobial therapy He developed respiratory distress 2xa0days later, and O2 saturation declined Blood tests showed an increased Nterminal proB type natriuretic peptide NTproBNP level, and echocardiography showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction and Ee ratio of 16 Computed tomography scan showed interstitial pulmonary oedema and prominent peripheral pulmonary vascular markings Given these findings, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction HFpEF was considered Lowdose diuretic was started, and fluid administration was restricted, resulting in a decrease in NTproBNP level, clinical and haemodynamic stabilization, and improved oxygenation This case highlights the occurrence of HFpEF in coronavirus disease 2019,,BACKGROUND The pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 has brought a global public health crisis However, the pathogenesis underlying COVID19 are barely understood METHODS In this study, we performed proteomic analyses of airway mucus obtained by bronchoscopy from severe COVID19 patients In total, 2351 and 2073 proteins were identified and quantified in COVID19 patients and healthy controls, respectively RESULTS Among them, 92 differentiated expressed proteins DEPs 46 upregulated and 46 downregulated were found with a fold change 15 or 067 and a pvalue 005, and 375 proteins were uniquely present in airway mucus from COVID19 patients Pathway and network enrichment analyses revealed that the 92 DEPs were mostly associated with metabolic, complement and coagulation cascades, lysosome, and cholesterol metabolism pathways, and the 375 COVID19 only proteins were mainly enriched in amino acid degradation Valine, Leucine and Isoleucine degradation, amino acid metabolism betaAlanine, Tryptophan, Cysteine and Methionine metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, phagosome, and cholesterol metabolism pathways CONCLUSIONS This study aims to provide fundamental data for elucidating proteomic changes of COVID19, which may implicate further investigation of molecular targets directing at specific therapy,BackgroundMaintenance hemodialysis MHD patients are at increased risk for coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 The aim of this study was to describe clinical, laboratory, and radiologic characteristics and determinants of mortality in a large group of MHD patients hospitalized for COVID19MethodsThis multicenter, retrospective, observational study collected data from 47 nephrology clinics in Turkey Baseline clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics, and COVID19 treatments during hospitalization, need for intensive care and mechanical ventilation were recorded The main study outcome was inhospital mortality and the determinants were analyzed by Cox regression survival analysisResultsOf 567 MHD patients, 93 163 patients died, 134 236 patients admitted to intensive care unit ICU and 91 of the ones in ICU 679 needed mechanical ventilation Patients who died were older median age, 66 5774 vs 63 5271 years, pu2009u20090019, had more congestive heart failure 349 versus 207, pu2009u20090004 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 236 versus 127, pu2009u20090008 compared to the discharged patients Most patients 896 had radiological manifestations compatible with COVID19 pulmonary involvement Median platelet 166u2009×u2009103 per mm3 versus 192u2009×u2009103 per mm3, pu2009u20090011 and lymphocyte 800 per mm3 versus 1000 per mm3, p,We describe a 40yearold man with severe COVID19 requiring mechanical ventilation who developed aortobiiliac arterial, right lower extremity arterial, intracardiac, pulmonary arterial and iliocaval venous thromboses and required right lower extremity amputation for acute limb ischemia This unique case illustrates COVID19associated thrombotic complications occurring at multiple, different sites in the cardiovascular system of a single infected patient,Percutaneous intervention in the context of coronary artery ectasia CAE is penalized with noreflow phenomenon The glycoproteinIIbIIIainhibitor abciximab was the most accepted method for pharmacology thrombus resolution in this scenario, nevertheless, this agent was recently withdrawn We describe 5 patients treated with local intracoronary fibrinolysis administrated through predesigned catheters in the setting of AMI and CAE,Background PM25 particles matter smaller aerodynamic diameter of 25 μm  exposure, as one major environmental risk factor for the global burden of disease, is associated with high risks of respiratory diseases and lung cancer Hemeoxygenase 1 HMOX1 has been considered as one of the major molecular antioxidant defenses to mediate cytoprotective effects against diverse stressors, including PM25induced toxicity and SARSCoV2 infection however, the regulatory mechanism of HMOX1 expression still needs to be elucidated In this study, using PM25 as a typical stressor, we explored whether microRNAs miRNAs might modulate HMOX1 expression in lung cellsxa0Results Systematic bioinformatics analysis showed that seven miRNAs have the potential to target HMOX1 gene Among these, hsamiR760 was identified as a response miRNA to PM25 exposure More importantly, we revealed a nonconventional miRNA function in hsamiR760 upregulating HMOX1 expression, by targeting the coding region and interacting with YBX1 protein In addition, we observed that exogenous hsamiR760 effectively elevated HMOX1 expression, reduced the reactive oxygen agents ROS levels, and then rescued the lung cells from PM25induced apoptosis Conclusion Our results revealed that hsamiR760 might play an important role in protecting lung cells against PM25induced toxicity, by elevating HMOX1 expression, and offered new clues to elucidate the diverse function of miRNAs,In the context of collateral circulation of the heart, the role of extracardiac collateral arteries has been thought to be negligible We present a case in which such collateral vessel acted as a rescue, subsequent to a failed revascularisation attempt With surgeons nowadays considering less is more in terms of grafting in coronary artery bypass grafting CABG, and more evidence arising in favour of medical therapy, we need to reassess the role of these collateral vessels in the coronary circulation,,A young man hospitalized in severe biventricular heart failure, awaiting his third heart transplant, held a wish that he had not expressed to any of the myriad of clinicians involved in his care It was only at the suggestion of his mother that he, in the hope of having his wish fulfilled, shared his wish with a medical student on the Palliative Care service Through years of navigating the stressful complexities of her sons medical care, this mother had encountered Palliative care and had come to expect of palliative care, a compassionate presence, compassionate listening, and a compassionate response,INTRODUCTION Recent randomised clinical trials showed benefit of nonculprit lesion revascularisation in STelevation myocardial infarction STEMI patients However, it remains unclear whether revascularisation should be performed at the index procedure or at a later stage METHODS AND ANALYSIS The instantaneous wavefree ratio iFR Guided Multivessel Revascularisation During Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for Acute Myocardial Infarction trial is a multicentre, randomised controlled prospective openlabel trial with blinded evaluation of endpoints After successful primary percutaneous coronary intervention PCI, eligible STEMI patients with residual nonculprit lesions are randomised, to instantaneous wavefree ratio guided treatment of nonculprit lesions during the index procedure versus deferred cardiac MRguided management within 4 days to 6 weeks The primary endpoint of the study is the combined occurrence of allcause death, recurrent myocardial infarction and hospitalisation for heart failure at 12 months followup Clinical followup includes questionnaires at 3 months and outpatient visits at 6 months and 12 months after primary PCI Furthermore, a costeffectiveness analysis will be performed ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Permission to conduct this trial has been granted by the Medical Ethical Committee of the Amsterdam University Medical Centres loc VUmc, ID NL6010702916 The primary results of this trial will be shared in a main article and subgroup analyses or spinoff studies will be shared in secondary papers TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER NCT03298659,Acute lung inflammatory diseases severely affect the patients recovery and outcomes worldwide Unregulated acute inflammatory response is fundamentally central to acute lung inflammation including acute lung injury ALI and acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS To limit the potentially deleterious effects of acute lung inflammation, complex transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory networks have been explored, which often involves long noncoding RNAs lncRNA LncRNAs are RNAs that longer than 200 nucleotides, functioning as scaffolds or decoys in the cytoplasm or nucleus By now, lncRNAs have been found to join in all major cellular processes including cell proliferation, metabolism, stress response or death Extensive advance over the last decade furthermore indicated a fundamental role of lncRNAs in acute lung inflammation This article reviews and summarizes the current knowledge on lncRNA in acute lung inflammatory response,Noncavitary torso hemorrhage is a rare and poorly characterized injury that can lead to exsanguination if not promptly addressed When present in a highrisk patient on therapeutic anticoagulation, it can lead to a swift fatal outcome Two cases an 80yearold female on warfarin and a 67yearold male on apixaban for atrial fibrillation presented with shock after direct blunt trauma in their torsos Embolotherapy techniques were utilized to obtain angiostasis while the patients were resuscitated with massive transfusion protocols and reversal of the agents received In the setting of severe localized blunt trauma on an aging victim while on antithrombotic medications, noncavitary torso hemorrhage must be included in the differential diagnosis Local expertise and a high level of suspicion were critical in the early intervention, and postprocedural management of the injuries sustained and secured a good result,Primary percutaneous coronary intervention PCI is now the recommended reperfusion technique for patients with acute STsegment elevation myocardial infarction However, despite early reperfusion in the majority of patients, PCI does not achieve effective myocardial reperfusion in a significant proportion of patients due to the prevalence of coronary microvascular obstruction The amount of infarcted myocardium has been considered to be a reliable indicator of major adverse cardiovascular eventsxa0and resultant adverse left ventricular remodeling The purpose of this paper is to review the clinical benefits of supersaturated oxygen therapy following PCI for STsegment elevation myocardial infarction,Background The clinical manifestation of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 overlap with other disorders especially cardiovascular diseases CVD The prevailing conditions in the COVID19 pandemic can distract us from other differential diagnosesCase presentation We report a 58 years old female presented with syncope episodes and dyspnea on exertion DOE with the left atrial LA mass, candidate for surgical removal and mitral valve replacement Nearly 3 months later, she developed dyspnea, fever, and a sore throat cause to admit her with suspected COVID19 During diagnostic evaluation, a larger LA mass detected that seemed to be COVID19 induced organized thrombus with prosthetic mitral valve malfunction The mass resected and immunohistochemistry revealed liposarcomaConclusions The unusual early recurrence of liposarcoma and misdiagnosis with COVID19 induced thrombosis is the hallmark of the present case that we keep other causes in mind besides COVID19,Despite improvements in leukemia therapy, acute myeloid leukemia AML remain a difficult disease to treat with a majority of patients having disease relapse without an allogeneic stem cell transpl,Introduction The nationwide shortage of pediatric cardiologists in medically underserved areas poses a challenge to congenital heart disease CHD screening requiring echocardiography, resulting in transfer of neonates to regional Level IIIIV Neonatal Intensive Care Units NICUs This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy, safety, and costeffectiveness of teleechocardiography for advanced CHD screening at a Level II NICU managed by a hybrid telemedicine system Methods Retrospective chart review of infants requiring teleechocardiography at a Level II NICU Patient demographics, echocardiography indications, and findings were analyzed Agreement between teleechocardiography and conventional echocardiography findings was assessed Transport cost savings were calculated based on preventable transfers to Level IV NICU Descriptive statistics were computed for demographic and clinical variables Results Over 5 years, 52 infants were screened for CHD Thirtytwo infants 62 had findings consistent with minor CHD or normal neonatal transitional physiology Twenty infants 38 had abnormal findings requiring followup with either a conventional echocardiography as inpatient at the regional Level IV NICU or as outpatient after discharge Only 5 infants 10 required transfer to a Level IV NICU for CHD management, whereas 15 infants 29 were scheduled for outpatient followup Strong agreement was noted between teleechocardiography and conventional echocardiography findings No case of critical congenital heart disease CCHD was missed Teleechocardiography saved 260,000 in transport costs Conclusions Teleechocardiography can be accurate, safe, and effective in CHD screening, preventing unnecessary transfer of most infants to regional Level IIIIV NICUs, saving transfer costs,PURPOSE We aimed to evaluate the safety and diagnostic accuracy of computed tomography CTguided transthoracic biopsy of small lung nodules 20 mm adjacent to the pericardium or great vessels METHODS This retrospective study examined the safety and diagnostic accuracy of percutaneous CTguided biopsy for small lung nodules 20 mm located within 10 mm of the pericardium or great vessels Technical aspects and factors influencing complications were assessed, and diagnostic accuracy was calculated RESULTS A total of 168 biopsies were performed in 168 patients The complications were mainly pneumothorax 345 58 of 168 patients, chest tube insertion 53 9 of 168 patients, and pulmonary hemorrhage 613 103 of 168 procedures, with no patient mortality One patient 06 was admitted because of hemorrhage complications Significant independent risk factors for pneumothorax were nodules resided in upper or middle lobes and lateral patient position, and for hemorrhage, longer distance from structures and longer needle trajectory through the lung parenchyma Overall, the sensitivity, accuracy, and specificity were 910, 922, and 100, respectively CONCLUSION Percutaneous CTguided transthoracic biopsy was highly accurate in small lung nodules 20 mm adjacent to the pericardium or great vessels Complications are common, but most were minor and selflimited,In vitro interferon IFNα treatment of primary human upper airway basal cells has been shown to drive ACE2 expression, the receptor of SARSCoV2 The protease furin is also involved in mediating SARSCoV2 and other viral infections, although its association with early IFN response has not been evaluated yet In order to assess the in vivo relationship between ACE2 and furin expression and the IFN response in nasopharyngeal cells, we first examined ACE2 and furin levels and their correlation with the wellknown marker of IFNs activation, ISG15, in children nxa0xa059 and adults nxa0xa048, during respiratory diseases not caused by SARSCoV2 A strong positive correlation was found between ACE2 expression, but not of furin, and ISG15 in all patients analyzed In addition, type I and III IFN stimulation experiments were performed to examine the IFNmediated activation of ACE2 isoforms fulllength and truncated and furin in epithelial cell lines Following all the IFNs treatments, only the truncated ACE2 levels, were upregulated significantly in the A549 and Calu3 cells, in particular by type I IFNs If confirmed in vivo following IFNs activation, the induction of the truncated ACE2 isoform only would not enhance the risk of SARSCoV2 infection in the respiratory tract,PURPOSE We investigated the impact of modelbased iterative reconstruction MBIR on 320detector row computed tomography angiography CTA in infants with complex congenital heart disease CHD METHODS Seventy infants with complex CHD who underwent 320detector row CTA 40 boys and 30 girls age range, 022 months median age, 60 days were retrospectively evaluated First, the images were reconstructed by filtered back projection FBP, hybrid iterative reconstruction HIR, or MBIR in 20 cases, and variables were compared among the three iterative reconstruction methods IR test Second, the variables were compared between 25 cases scanned using HIR and 25 cases scanned using MBIR, with a 20 standard deviation noise level for both Attenuation values and contrasttonoise ratios CNRs of the great vessels and heart chambers were calculated Total doselength products were recorded for all patients radiation dose RD test RESULTS In the IR test, the mean CNR values were 4813 for FBP, 6914 for HIR, and 8217 for MBIR P  00001 The best subjective image qualities in the great vessels and heart chambers were obtained with MBIR In RD testing, no significant differences between HIR and MBIR in image quality CNR HIR, 8424 MBIR, 8324 were observed The effective dose was significantly lower for MBIR than for HIR 0702 vs 1103 mSv P  0001 CONCLUSION The MBIR algorithm significantly improved image quality and decreased radiation exposure in 320row CTA of infants with complex CHD, providing an alternative to FBP or HIR that is both safer and produces better results,,,Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 may present with pulmonary and extrapulmonary manifestations We present a 41yearold patient who presented with 1 week of increasing dyspnea and fever and initial chest radiography demonstrated bilateral diffuse infiltrates Due to the patients progressively worsening symptoms, he was intubated, paralyzed, sedated He began proning, 100 fractional inspired oxygenation ventilation, and venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation Computed tomography of the thorax revealed completely opacified lungs bilaterally with the exception of a small, aerated apicoposterior segment of the left lung Computed tomography of the head demonstrated several areas of hemorrhage, areas of hypodensity consistent with posterior cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery territory infarcts, and findings consistent with transtentorial herniation Given the radiologic findings and nonprogressive clinical status, the family placed the patient on comfort care and the patient died within minutes of extubation As with our patient at the time of admission, presenting symptoms and clinical laboratory data provide reliable prognostic factors for patients with COVID19,BACKGROUND The COVID19 pandemic is placing blood and tissue establishments under unprecedented stress, putting its capacity to provide the adequate care needed at risk Here we reflect on how our integrated organisational model has faced the first impact of the pandemic and describe what challenges, opportunities and lessons have emerged MATERIALS AND METHODS The organisational model of the Catalan Blood and Tissue Bank Banc de Sang i Teixits, BST is described The new scenario was managed by following international recommendations and considering the pandemic in a context of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity VUCA, allowing rapid measures to be taken These aimed to ensure donor safety, promote proper responses to patients needs, ensure the health and wellbeing of personnel, and prepare for future scenarios RESULTS The BST has adapted its activities to the changes in demand No shortage of any product or service occurred Donor acceptance, safety and wellbeing were maintained except for tissue donation, which almost completely stopped To support the health system, several activities have been promoted largescale convalescent plasma CP production, clinical trials with CP and mesenchymal stromal cells, massive COVID19 diagnoses, and participation in cooperative research and publications Haemovigilance is running smoothly and no adverse effects have been detected among donors or patients DISCUSSION Several elements have proven to be critical when addressing the pandemic scenario a the early creation of a crisis committee in combination with technical recommendations and the recognition of a VUCA scenario b identification of the strategies described c the integrated donortopatient organisational model d active Research and Development RD and e the flexibility of the staff It is essential to underline the importance of the need for centralised management, effective contingency strategies, and early collaboration with peers,BACKGROUND Prioritization among patients with coronary artery disease represents a difficult issue during the SARSCoV2 pandemic We present our clinical practices and patients outcomes after elective, emergent, and urgent cardiovascular surgery and percutaneous coronary interventions PCI We also investigated the rate of nosocomial infection of SARSCoV2 in health workers HWs, including surgeons after cardiovascular procedures and percutaneous interventions PCI MATERIAL AND METHODS We performed 186 cardiovascular operations and PCI between March 15 and October 15 According to the level of priority LoP, we performed urgent and emergent coronary artery bypass grafting CABG and cardiac valve repair or replacement surgery in 44 patients In one patient with acute chordae rupture with pulmonary edema, we performed mitral valve replacement We performed the aortic arch repair in two patients with typeI aortic dissection in urgent situations Therefore, in 47 patients we performed cardiac operations in urgent or emergent situations Elective CABG N  28 and elective cardiac valve N  10 surgeries were performed total 38 While rescue PCI was urgently performed in 47 patients with STsegment elevation myocardial infarction STEMI, it was performed in elective or emergent situations in 40 patients with myocardial ischemia Endovascular treatment was performed in four patients with deep venous thrombosis DVT and in four patients with chronic arterial occlusion, respectively Surgical vascular repair and embolectomy were performed in patients with peripheral artery injury N  6 and acute arterial embolic events N  4, respectively We performed thoracic computed tomography followed by reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction RTPCR test in patients with irregular diffuse reticular opacities with or without consolidation on chest Xray Blood coagulation disorders including ddimer, thromboplastin time TT, and partial thromboplastin time aPTT were measured prior to procedures RESULTS No mortality and morbidity was seen after percutaneous and surgical arterial or venous procedures The total mortality rate was 41 8 of 186 CAD patients or valve surgery after urgent and emergent CABG N  4, an urgent valve replacement N  1, and PCI N  3 Low cardiac output syndrome LOS and major adverse cardiac cerebrovascular event MACCE were the mortality factors after cardiac surgery The reasons for death after PCI were sudden cardiac arrest related to the dissection of the left main coronary artery during procedure and pneumonia due to COVID19 N  2 Groundglass opacities in combination with pulmonary consolidations were detected in seven patients Interlobular septal and pleural thickening with patchy bronchiectasis in the bilateral lower lobe involvement was found after thoracic computed tomography in these patients We confirmed inhospital COVID19 using a PCR test in two patients with STEMI prior to PCI PT and aPTT increased, but fibrin degradation products did not in those two patients We confirmed COVID19 via phone call in six CABG patients and one PCI patient after discharge from the hospital None of the patients diagnosed with COVID19 died after being discharged from the hospital CONCLUSION Cardiovascular surgery and PCI can safely be performed with acceptable complications and mortality rates in elective situations, during the COVID19 pandemic Preoperative control of OR traffic, careful evaluation of the patients history, consultation, and precautions taken by healthcare professionals are important, during and after procedures Also important is wearing a mask and face shield and careful disinfection of equipment and space,COVID19 ARDS is associated with prolonged ventilator dependence and high mortality, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown Critical to the pathogenesis of ARDS is injury to the alveolar epithelial cell AEC barrier clinical recovery requires epithelial regeneration We previously identified a KRT8 hi transitional state that regenerating AEC2s adopt during differentiation into AEC1s, the persistence of which may be pathogenic in pulmonary fibrosis Here, we hypothesize that ineffectual differentiation of transitional cells into AEC1s without fibrosis may perpetuate barrier permeability and poor clinical outcomes in COVID19 ARDS To test this hypothesis, we examined postmortem lung tissue of COVID19 ARDS patients We observed extensive AEC1 injury, rare mature AEC2s, and abundant transitional cells Transitional cells were cuboidal, partially spread or, rarely, flat but did not express AEC1 markers They formed monolayers on alveolar septa denuded of AEC1s but structurally normal without fibrosis We conclude that ineffectual AEC1 differentiation from transitional AECs may perpetuate barrier permeability and respiratory failure in COVID19 ARDS In contrast to fibrosis, transitional AECs may retain the capacity for physiologic AEC1 regeneration with restoration of normal alveolar architecture and function Novel therapies to promote AEC1 differentiation from transitional cells may accelerate barrier restitution and clinical recovery in ARDS,,,SARSCoV2 infection is characterized by extremely heterogeneous features, going from cases with few symptoms to severe respiratory failures Chest Computed Tomography CT is currently the goldstandard imaging method, although burdened by the risk of exposure to ionizing radiation and management  organizational concerns In particular, the critical patient undergoing ventilation invasive or not seems to be difficult to monitor by repeated CT scan over time We report the case of a 55yearold male patient subjected to Continuous Positive Airway Pressure CPAP and prone positioning, in which the use of ultrasound monitoring allowed to verify the effectiveness of the pressure support used in recruiting previously atelectasis lung areas Lung ultrasound can guide pulmonary recruitment and pronation maneuvers in patients undergoing noninvasive ventilation Ultrasound can identify atelectatic lung areas, which demonstrate an alveolar reexpansion following the setting of high PEEP values, as underlined by the reappearance of pleuralair interface,Abstract  Aims Reninangiotensin system blockers such as angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors ACEIs and angiotensin receptor blockers ARBs may increase the risk of adverse outcomes in COVID19 In this study, the relationships between ACEIARB use and COVID19 related mortality were examined   Methods  Consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID19 by RTPCR at the Hong Kong Hospital Authority between 1 st January and 28 th July 2020 were included    Results This study included 2774 patients The mortality rate of the COVID19 positive group was 15 n42 Those who died had a higher median age 823765895 vs 429282595 years old P00001, more likely to have baseline comorbidities of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease P00001 They were more frequently prescribed ACEIARBs at baseline, and steroids, lopinavirritonavir, ribavirin and hydroxychloroquine during admission P00001 They also had a higher white cell count, higher neutrophil count, lower platelet count, prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time, higher Ddimer, troponin, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase and alkaline phosphatase P00001 Multivariate Cox regression showed that age, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, diabetes mellitus, the use of ACEIsARBs and diuretics, and various laboratory tests remained significant predictors of mortality   Conclusions We report that an association between ACEIsARBs with COVID19 related mortality even after adjusting for cardiovascular and other comorbidities, as well as medication use Patients with greater comorbidity burden and laboratory markers reflecting deranged clotting, renal and liver function, and increased tissue inflammation, and ACEIARB use have a higher mortality risk   Key Points   We report that an association between ACEIsARBs with COVID19 related mortality even after adjusting for cardiovascular and other comorbidities, as well as medication use   Patients with greater comorbidity burden and laboratory markers reflecting deranged clotting, renal and liver function, and increased tissue inflammation, and ACEIARB use have a higher mortality risk,With the introduction of immunomodulatory drugs, proteasome inhibitors, and antiCD38xa0monoclonal antibodies, major improvements have been achieved in the treatment of multiple myeloma MM, with a significant impact on the outcome of this disease Different treatment combinations are now in use and other therapies are being developed Based on an extensive review of the recent literature, we propose practical recommendations on myeloma management, to be used by hematologists as a reference for daily practice,BACKGROUND Introduction Ever since Sars CoV2 infection has started from China and has taken the shape of pandemic the mortality associated with this disease has been under discussion and hypercoagubility, acute severe respiratory syndrome and sepsis with multi organ failure have been accursed as possible reasons of deaths in cases infected with novel Corona virus We conducted a retrospective analysis of the cases admitted in our high dependency and Intensive care unit and tried to pinpoint the major cause of mortality in our cases Methods This is a single center retrospective study carried out at Bahria International Hospital Lahore over a 3 month period May 10th to July 10th 2020 in which we analyzed the clinical and biochemical profiles of the COVID19 patients who died during this period Results A total of 108 patients were admitted during this period out of which 11 patients died 7 of them were men and 4 women Majority of them had sudden cardiac arrest due to acute coronary syndrome followed by multiorgan dysfunction syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome Conclusion Acute coronary syndrome due to hypercoagubility was the leading cause of death in our patients   OBJECTIVE To evaluate major cause of mortality in our COVID 19 cases   METHODS This is a single center retrospective study carried out at Bahria International Hospital Lahore over a 3 month period May 10th to July 10th 2020 in which we analyzed the clinical and biochemical profiles of the COVID19 patients who died during this period   RESULTS A total of 108 patients were admitted during this period out of which 11 patients died 7 of them were men and 4 women Majority of them had sudden cardiac arrest due to acute coronary syndrome followed by multiorgan dysfunction syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome   CONCLUSIONS Acute coronary syndrome due to hypercoagubility was the leading cause of death in our patients,,,,,,The coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic has now infected six million people and is responsible for nearly four hundred thousand deaths We review the potential role of the lung ultrasound to evaluate its benefits and potential roles to compare it to the current gold standard of computed tomography A literature search was carried out utilizing electronic search engines and databases with COVID19 Keywords related to the lung ultrasound LUS were used to refine this search  only the relevant articles found are cited This review showed that there exists a strong correlation between the CT and LUS scan in COVID19 Prominent features include the vertical Blines, thicker pleural lines, and subpleural consolidation Potential roles include reducing transmission between healthcare workers and monitoring the progress of the disease However, the current research is scarce compared to wellestablished imaging modalities, and as such, there is a necessity for more research to confirm the findings of this review,COVID19 can cause damage to the lung, which can result in progressive respiratory failure and potential death Chest radiography and CT are the imaging tools used to diagnose and monitor patients with COVID19 Lung ultrasound LUS during COVID19 is being used in some areas to aid decisionmaking and improve patient care However, its increased use could help improve existing practice for patients with suspected COVID19, or other lung disease A limitation of LUS is that it requires practitioners with sufficient competence to ensure timely, safe, and diagnostic clinicalimaging assessments This commentary discusses the role and governance of LUS during and beyond the COVID19 pandemic, and how increased education and training in this discipline can be undertaken given the restrictions in imaging highly infectious patients The use of simulation, although numerical methods or dedicated scan trainers, and machine learning algorithms could further improve the accuracy of LUS, whilst helping to reduce its learning curve for greater uptake in clinical practice,Coronavirus disease 2019xa0COVID19 is a rapidly emerging pandemic disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 Critical COVID19 is thought to be associated with a hyperinflammatory process that can develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome, a critical disease normally mediated by dysfunctional neutrophils This study tested the hypothesis whether the neutrophil compartment displays characteristics of hyperinflammation in COVID19 patients Therefore, a prospective study was performed on all patients with suspected COVID19 presenting at the emergency room of a large academic hospital Blood drawn within 2 d after hospital presentation was analyzed by pointofcare automated flow cytometry and compared with blood samples collected at later time points COVID19 patients did not exhibit neutrophilia or eosinopenia Unexpectedly neutrophil activation markers CD11b, CD16, CD10, and CD62L did not differ between COVID19positive patients and COVID19negative patients diagnosed with other bacterialviral infections, or between COVID19 severity groups In all patients, a decrease was found in the neutrophil maturation markers indicating an inflammationinduced left shift of the neutrophil compartment In COVID19 this was associated with disease severity,BACKGROUND The available information on the echocardiographic features of cardiac injury related to the novel coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 and their prognostic value are scattered in the different literature Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the echocardiographic features of cardiac injury related to COVID19 and their prognostic value METHODS Published studies were identified through searching PubMed, Embase Elsevier, and Google scholar databases The search was performed using the different combinations of the keywords echocard, cardiac ultrasound, TTE, TEE, transtho, or transeso with COVID19, sarsCOV2, novel corona, or 2019nCOV Two researchers independently screened the titles and abstracts and full texts of articles to identify studies that evaluated the echocardiographic features of cardiac injury related to COVID19 andor their prognostic values RESULTS Of 783 articles retrieved from the initial search, 11 8 cohort and 3 crosssectional studies met our eligibility criteria Rates of echocardiographic abnormalities in COVID19 patients varied across different studies as follow RV dilatation from 150 to 489 RV dysfunction from 36 to 40 and LV dysfunction 54 to 400 Overall, the RV abnormalities were more common than LV abnormalities The majority of the studies showed that there was a significant association between RV abnormalities and the severe forms and death of COVID19 CONCLUSION The available evidence suggests that RV dilatation and dysfunction may be the most prominent echocardiographic abnormality in symptomatic patients with COVID19, especially in those with more severe or deteriorating forms of the disease Also, RV dysfunction should be considered as a poor prognostic factor in COVID19 patients,Aim Face masks are an important addition to our arsenal in the fight against COVID19 The aim of this study is to present a novel method of measuring mask performance which can simultaneously assess both fabric penetration and leakage due to poor fit Materials  methods A synthetic aerosol is introduced into the lung of a medical dummy A conical laser sheet surrounds the face of the dummy where it illuminates the aerosol emittedxa0during a simulated breath The system is demonstrated with five mask types Conclusions The curved laser sheet highlights both penetration through the mask fabric and leakage around the edges of the mask A large variation in both material penetration and leakage was observed,,Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 has become an extensive pandemic worldwide since it is firstly broken out in Wuhan in December 2019 As of July 26, 2020, this disease has resulted in more than 600,000 of death and the numbers remains increasing Pneumonia is commonly developed in COVID19 confirmed patients, and it weakens lung functions and decreases the oxygen levels of blood As an oxygen carrier, hemoglobin transport oxygen from lung to other organs and meanwhile plays a vital role in maintaining the balance of blood oxygen Therefore, we speculate that a decrease of hemoglobin, also known as anemia, would weaken the oxygen transport and aggravates the illness of COVID19 Moreover, anemia is commonly observed in a large proportion of COVID19 confirmed patients Taken together, anemia might be associated with the COVID19 The aim of this study was performed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID19 confirmed patients with anemia and to further investigate the relationship between anemia and COVID19,,,,,The global COVID19 pandemic has led to unprecedented change throughout society1 As the articles in this supplement outline, all segments of the broader cardiovascular community have been forced to adapt, to change models of care delivery, and to evolve and innovate in order to deliver optimal management for cardiovascular patients The medtechdevice industry has not been exempt from such change and has been forced to navigate direct and indirect COVIDassociated disruption, with effects felt from supply chain logistics to the entire product lifecycle, from the running of clinical trials to new device approvals and managing training, proctoring and congresses in an increasinglyonline world This seachange in circumstances itself has enforced the industry, in effect, to disrupt its own processes, models and activities Whilst some of these changes may be temporary, many will endure for some time and some will doubtless become permanent one thing is for sure the healthcare ecosystem, including the medical device industry, will never look quite the same again Although the pandemic has brought a short to mediumterm medical crisis to many countries, its role as a powerful disruptor cannot be underestimated, and may indeed prove to be a force for longterm good, given the accelerated innovation and rapid adaptation that it has cultivated,The Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic has become the worst pandemic in modern history The lack of prior immunity to the virus has resulted in a high mortality rate, though children have fared better than adults, overall We present a case of a child who developed Bcell acute lymphoblastic leukemia 1 week following a symptomatic COVID19 infection It is possible that this viral infection provided the second hit posited to occur in pediatric leukemogenesis as proposed by Dr Greaves, with his initial viral exposure occurring several weeks earlier,Coronavirus disease2019 COVID19 caused by SARSCoV2 is an ongoing viral pandemic marked by increased risk of thrombotic events However, the role of platelets in the elevated observed thrombotic risk in COVID19 and utility of antiplatelet agents in attenuating thrombosis is unknown We aimed to determine if human platelets express the known SARSCoV2 receptorprotease axis on their cell surface and assess whether the antiplatelet effect of aspirin may mitigate risk of myocardial infarction MI, cerebrovascular accident CVA, and venous thromboembolism VTE in COVID19 Expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 on human platelets were detected by immunoblotting and confirmed by confocal microscopy We evaluated 22,072 symptomatic patients tested for COVID19 Propensitymatched analyses were performed to determine if treatment with aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs NSAIDs affected thrombotic outcomes in COVID19 Neither aspirin nor NSAIDs affected mortality in COVID19 However, both aspirin and NSAID therapies were associated with increased risk of the combined thrombotic endpoint of MI, CVA, and VTE Thus, while platelets clearly express ACE2TMPRSS2 receptorprotease axis for SARSCoV2 infection, aspirin does not prevent thrombosis and death in COVID19 The mechanisms of thrombosis in COVID19, therefore, appears distinct and the role of platelets as direct mediators of SARSCoV2mediated thrombosis warrants further investigation,BACKGROUND Cardiovascular comorbidity anticipates poor prognosis of SARSCoV2 disease COVID19 and correlates with the systemic atherosclerotic transformation of the arterial vessels The amount of aortic wall calcification AWC can be estimated on lowdose chest CT We suggest quantification of AWC on the lowdose chest CT, which is initially performed for the diagnosis of COVID19, to screen for patients at risk of severe COVID19 METHODS Seventy consecutive patients 46 in center 1, 24 in center 2 with parallel lowdose chest CT and positive RTPCR for SARSCoV2 were included in our multicenter, multivendor study The outcome was rated moderate no hospitalization, hospitalization and severe ICU, tracheal intubation, death, the latter implying a requirement for intensive care treatment The amount of AWC was quantified with the CT vendors software RESULTS Of 70 included patients, 38 developed a moderate, and 32 a severe COVID19 The average volume of AWC was significantly higher throughout the subgroup with severe COVID19, when compared to moderate cases 7717 mm3 Q1  498 mm3, Q3  30655 mm3 vs 0 mm3 Q1  0 mm3, Q3  573 mm3 Within multivariate regression analysis, including AWC, patient age and sex, as well as a cardiovascular comorbidity score, the volume of AWC was the only significant regressor for severe COVID19 p  0004 For AWC  3000 mm3, the logistic regression predicts risk for a severe progression of 078 If there are no visually detectable AWC risk for severe progression is 013, only CONCLUSION AWC seems to be an independent biomarker for the prediction of severe progression and intensive care treatment of COVID19 already at the time of patient admission to the hospital verification in a larger multicenter, multivendor study is desired,Severe respiratory sequelae drive morbidityassociated with coronavirus 2019 COVID19 disease We report a case of COVID19 pneumonia complicated by cavitary lesions and pneumothorax in a young healthy male Pneumothorax management with catheter thoracostomy and rapid resolution of the cavitary lesions are described An extensive workup for other causes a cavitation was negative and the temporal correlation of the cavities with COVID19 infection plus their rapid resolution suggest a direct relationship We propose a mechanism for cavitation secondary to microangiopathy, a cause of cavitation in the vasculitides and a known feature of COVID19,We describe the insertion of the Impella 50, a peripherally placed mechanical cardiovascular microaxial pump, in a patient with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction The Impella is a 7 Fr device capable of achieving a flow of 4050 Lmin its use necessitates an open arterial cutdown A subclavicular incision is used to access the right or left axillary artery A 10mm tube graft is anastomosed to the artery through which the Impella 50 is inserted The device traverses the tube graft and is advanced via the aorta, across the aortic valve, to its final position inflow toward the ventricular apex and outflow above the aorta The device may remain in situ for 10 days until recovery or until further supports are instituted Our goal is to demonstrate the insertion of the Impella 50 device in a patient with cardiogenic shock whose situation was further complicated by coronavirus disease 2019,Obesity rates in the United Kingdom are some of the highest in Western Europe, with considerable clinical and societal impacts Obesity is associated with type 2 diabetes T2D, osteoarthritis, cardiovascular disease, and increased mortality however, relatively few studies have examined the occurrence of multiple obesity‐related outcomes in the same patient population This study was designed to examine the associations between body mass index BMI and a broad range of obesity‐related conditions in the same large cohort from a UK‐representative primary care database Demographic data and diagnosis codes were extracted from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD database in January 2019 Adults registered for  3 years were grouped by BMI, with BMI 185249 kgm2 as reference group Associations between BMI and 12 obesity‐related outcomes were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models, adjusted for age, sex, and smoking More than 29 million individuals were included in the analyses and were followed up for occurrence of relevant outcomes for a median of 114 years during the study period Generally, there was a stepwise increase in risk of all outcomes with higher BMI Individuals with BMI 400450 kgm2 were at particularly high risk of sleep apnea hazard ratio 95 confidence interval vs reference group 198 189208, T2D 124 121127, heart failure 346 335357, and hypertension 321 315326 This study substantiates evidence linking higher BMI to higher risk of a range of serious health conditions, in a large, representative UK cohort By focusing on obesity‐related conditions, this demonstrates the wider clinical impact and the healthcare burden of obesity, and highlights the vital importance of management, treatment approaches, and public health programs to mitigate the impact of this disease,Despite recent advances in biostabilization, clinical blood supplies still experience shortages and storage limitations for red blood cells RBCs have not yet been sufficiently addressed Storing RBCs in a frozen or dried state is an appealing solution to address storage limitations, but many promising cryoprotectants, including the nonreducing sugar trehalose, are impermeant to mammalian cell membranes and cannot be utilized effectively using currently available compoundloading methods We found that transient pore formation induced by ultrasound and microbubbles sonoporation offers an effective means of loading trehalose into RBCs to facilitate longterm storage in a frozen or desiccated state The protective potential of trehalose loading was demonstrated by freezing processed RBCs at 1xa0°Cmin to 80xa0°C, then either storing the cells at 80xa0°C or lyophilizing them RBCs were either thawed or rehydrated after 42 days of storage and evaluated for membrane integrity and esterase activity to estimate recovery and cell viability The intracellular concentration of trehalose reached 40xa0mM after sonoporation and over 95 of treated RBCs were recovered after loading Loading of trehalose was sufficient to maintain RBC morphology and esterase activity in most cells during freezing 90 RBC recovery and to a lower degree after lyophilization and rehydration 20 recovery Combining sonoporation with an integrated fluidics device allowed for rapid loading of up to 70xa0mM trehalose into RBCs These results demonstrate the potential of sonoporationmediated trehalose loading to increase recovery of viable RBCs, which could lead to effective methods for longterm stabilization of RBCs,BACKGROUND The Spectra Optia allows automated performance of red blood cell reduction and isovolemic hemodilution IHD prior to standard red cell exchange RCE, and is primarily intended for patients with sickle cell disease SCD undergoing chronic RCE Data on the safety of inducing transient further anemia and the benefits of IHDRCE is limited and occasionally contradictory STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS In this retrospective crossover analysis of six patients with SCD who underwent chronic exchange with standard RCE Cobe Spectra followed by IHDRCE Spectra Optia, we compared safety and benefit outcomes with IHDRCE vs standard RCE RESULTS There were statistically but not clinically significant drops in blood pressure in the postIHD phase With IHDRCE, there were significant reductions in red blood cell RBC usage andor lower fraction of cells and significant increases in postprocedure hematocrit Hct associated with increased preprocedure Hct There were no differences achieved in the time interval between procedures or in the net RBC gain with IHDRCE Overall, there were also no significant differences in pre and postprocedure percentage of hemoglobin S, reticulocyte count, interval daily hemoglobin A decrement, or postprocedure white blood cell, neutrophil, or platelet counts CONCLUSIONS Our study supports that IHDRCE can be safely used in patients with stroke risk and compared to standard RCE, results in benefits of lower RBC usage andor fraction of cells remaining and higher postprocedure Hct associated with higher preprocedure Hct These findings support wider use of IHDRCE, especially in the current environment with reduced availability of minority units,Blood banks need to understand patterns of use and ordering practices to provide the blood donor centers with the best information with which to develop daily scheduled deliveries of blood products Blood use is a large component of this process through maximizing physician education about appropriate ordering practices and use of appropriate tools Simple measures can help provide guidance on the number of available components and the need to order more from the blood donor center Special product requests in pediatrics, such as fresh blood, leukoreduction, irradiation, and antigennegative units can also drive inventory practices and use patterns,Abstract  Objectives Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is currently a worldwide major health threat Recognizing hypoxia in patients early on can have a considerable effect on therapy success and survival rate   Methods  We collected data using a standard blood gas analyzer from 50 patients and analyzed measurements of partial pressure of carbon dioxidepCO 2 , partial pressure of oxygenpO 2 and oxygen saturationsO 2 , bicarbonate concentrationsHCO 3 as well as ionized calcium concentrations We further examined PCR test results for SARSCoV2 of the patients and analyzed differences between patients tested positive and those tested negative for the virus    Results  Venous pCO 2 was significantly higher whereas pO 2 and sO 2 were significantly lower in patients who tested positive for SARSCoV2 The pH, and ionized calcium concentrations of patients tested positive for the virus were significantly lower than in those tested negative    Conclusions Symptomatic SARSCoV2positive patients upon admission to the emergency room exhibit lower venous blood levels of oxygen, pH, and calcium and higher levels of carbon dioxide compared to symptomatic SARSCoV2negative patients This blood gas analysis constellation could help in identifying SARSCoV2positive patients more rapidly and identifying early signs of hypoxia,,Despite global efforts, there are no effective FDAapproved medicines for the treatment of SARSCoV2 infection Potential therapeutics focus on repurposed drugs, some with cardiac liabilities Here we report on a preclinical drug screening platform, a cardiac microphysiological system MPS, to assess cardiotoxicity associated with hydroxychloroquine HCQ and azithromycin AZM polytherapy in a mock clinical trial The MPS contained human heart muscle derived from patientspecific induced pluripotent stem cells The effect of drug response was measured using outputs that correlate with clinical measurements such as QT interval action potential duration and drugbiomarker pairing Chronic exposure to HCQ alone elicited early afterdepolarizations EADs and increased QT interval from day 6 onwards AZM alone elicited an increase in QT interval from day 7 onwards and arrhythmias were observed at days 8 and 10 Monotherapy results closely mimicked clinical trial outcomes Upon chronic exposure to HCQ and AZM polytherapy, we observed an increase in QT interval on days 48 Interestingly, a decrease in arrhythmias and instabilities was observed in polytherapy relative to monotherapy, in concordance with published clinical trials Furthermore, biomarkers, most of them measurable in patients serum, were identified for negative effects of single drug or polytherapy on tissue contractile function, morphology, and antioxidant protection The cardiac MPS can predict clinical arrhythmias associated with QT prolongation and rhythm instabilities This high content system can help clinicians design their trials, rapidly project cardiac outcomes, and define new monitoring biomarkers to accelerate access of patients to safe COVID19 therapeutics,,Abstract During the COVID19 pandemic, transesophageal echocardiography TEE for left atrial appendage thrombosis LAAT detection should be limited to situations of absolute necessity We sought to identify the main conventional and functional echocardiographic parameters associated with LAAT on TEE in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation NVAF patients planned for electrical cardioversion ECV This retrospective study included 125 consecutive NVAF patients 71578 yrs, 75 males, who underwent TEE at our Institution between April 2016 and January 2020, to exclude LAAT before scheduled ECV All patients underwent a transthoracic echocardiography TTE implemented with speckle tracking echocardiography STE analysis of left atrial LA strain and strain rate SR parameters 28 of patients were diagnosed with LAAT, while 72 without LAAT Compared to controls, patients with LAAT had significantly higher CHA2DS2Vasc Score and average Ee ratio, and significantly lower left ventricular ejection fraction LVEF Moreover, LApeak positive global atrial strain GSA and LASR parameters were significantly reduced in patients with LAAT Multivariate logistic regression revealed that, differently from CHA2DS2Vasc Score, LVEF OR 088, 95CI 081097, p  001, average Ee ratio OR 236, 95CI 141398, p  0001, and LAGSA OR 057, 95CI 036090, p  001 were independently associated with LAAT LAGSA optimal cutoff  91, AUC 095 showed the highest diagnostic performance Finally, a strong linear correlation of LA peaktopeak SR with both LA appendage filling r  086 and emptying r  083 velocities was demonstrated TTE implemented with STE analysis of LA mechanics improves thrombotic risk assessment of NVAF patients,,Background A systemic coagulation dysfunction has been associated with COVID19 In this case report, we describe a COVID19positive patient with multisite arterial thrombosis, presenting with acute limb ischaemia and concomitant STelevation myocardial infarction and oligosymptomatic lung disease Case summary An 83yearold lady with history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease presented to the Emergency Department with acuteonset left leg pain, pulselessness, and partial loss of motor function Acute limb ischaemia was diagnosed At the same time, a routine ECG showed STsegment elevation, diagnostic for inferior myocardial infarction On admission, a nasopharyngeal swab was performed to assess the presence of SARSCoV2, as per hospital protocol during the current COVID19 pandemic A totalbody CT angiography was performed to investigate the cause of acute limb ischaemia and to rule out aortic dissection the examination showed a total occlusion of the left common iliac artery and a nonobstructive thrombosis of a subsegmental pulmonary artery branch in the right basal lobe Lung CT scan confirmed a typical pattern of interstitial COVID19 pneumonia Coronary angiography showed a thrombotic occlusion of the proximal segment of the right coronary artery Percutaneous coronary intervention was performed, with manual thrombectomy, followed by deployment of two stents The patient was subsequently transferred to the operating room, where a Fogarty thrombectomy was performed The patient was then admitted to the COVID area of our hospital Seven hours later, the swab returned positive for COVID19 Discussion COVID19 can have an atypical presentation with thrombosis at multiple sites,From the beginning of the pandemic hypertension appeared as one of the most common comorbidities in patients hospitalised with a Covid19 infection Hypertension, diabetes, overweight, chronic pulm,BackgroundThis study was conceived to provide systematic data about lung mechanics during early phases of CoVID19 pneumonia, as long as to explore its variations during prone positioningMethodsWe enrolled four patients hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit of M Bufalini hospital, Cesena Italy after the positioning of an esophageal balloon, we measured mechanical power, respiratory system and transpulmonary parameters and arterial blood gases every 6 hours, just before decubitus change and 1 hour after pronosupinationResultsBoth respiratory system and transpulmonary compliance and driving pressure confirmed the pseudonormal respiratory mechanics of early CoVID19 pneumonia respectively, CRS 408xa0mlcmH2O and DPRS 97 cmH2O CL 531xa0mlcmH2O and DPL 79 cmH2O Interestingly, prone positioning involved a worsening in respiratory mechanical properties throughout time CRS,SUP 563xa0mlcmH2O and CRS,PR 415xa0mlcmH2O  P 037 CL,SUP 808xa0mlcmH2O and CL,PR 532xa0mlcmH2O  P 023ConclusionsDespite the severe ARDS pattern, respiratory system and lung mechanical properties during CoVID19 pneumonia are pseudonormal and tend to worsen during pronationTrial registrationRestrospectively registered,,Introduction The widespread prevalence of Coronavirus COVID19 around the world has raised concerns about physical activity and exercise Patients with COVID19 are 22 percent more likely to have heart damage than other people with infectious diseases Due to the cardiovascular complications seen in patients, there are limitations for athletes due to the severity of the disease Despite doubts about the outcomes of COVID 19 disease, there is a lot of insist on athletes to continue sports matches, including football, due to economic and competitive factor The main aim of this study was to explain about the time when athletes with Covid19 and cardiovascular approach return to sports activities,Background The COVID19 pandemic has resulted in people avoiding hospital admission for nonCOVID patients and forcing people to seek help via telehealth or alternative medicineCase study A 30yearold man from Solo, Indonesia, complained of left chest discomfort with an irregular heartbeat This man sent an inquiry and his left eye sclera profile through WhatsApp on July 20, 2020 to a researcher, who is a nurse and Su jok therapist Protocol for Su jok therapy was sent back through WhatsApp, and after applying the treatment for 30 minutes, the patient felt better, and symptoms were less severe The full protocol to be applied for the following days was then sent to the patient After three weeks, there was a less sharp red line in the sclera area of the vessel blockage, and he only experienced mild symptomsConclusion The case study shows that Su jok therapy may become an alternative therapy for managing chest pain at home Sclerology can be a complementary choice to monitor a patients heart condition Visiting the hospital, however, is still necessary when the symptoms become worse,Sudden cardiac death SCD is one of the most common causes of death worldwide with a higher frequency especially in the young Therefore, SCD is represented frequently in forensic autopsy practice, whereupon pathological findings in the heart can explain acute death These pathological changes may not only include myocardial infarction, coronary thrombosis, or all forms of myocarditisendocarditis but also rare diseases such as hereditary structural or arrythmogenic anomalies, lesions of the cardiac conduction system, or primary cardiac tumours,,Megakaryocytes MKs are platelet progenitor stem cells found in the bone marrow Platelets obtained from blood draws can be used for therapeutic applications, especially platelet transfusion The needs for platelet transfusions for clinical situation is increasing, due in part to the growing number of patients undergoing chemotherapy Platelets obtained from donors, however, have the disadvantages of a limited storage lifespan and the risk of donorrelated infection Extensive effort has therefore been directed at manufacturing platelets ex vivo Here, we review ex vivo technologies for MK development, focusing on human adipose tissuederived mesenchymal stemstromal cell line ASCLbased strategies and their potential clinical application Bone marrow and adipose tissues contain mesenchymal stemstromal cells that have an ability to differentiate into MKs, which release platelets Taking advantage of this mechanism, we developed a donorindependent system for manufacturing platelets for clinical application using ASCL established from adiposederived mesenchymal stemstromal cells ASCs Culture of ASCs with endogenous thrombopoietin and its receptor cMPL, and endogenous genes such as p45NFE2 leads to MK differentiation and subsequent platelet production ASCs compose heterogeneous cells, however, and are not suitable for clinical application Thus, we established ASCLs, which expand into a more homogeneous population, and fulfill the criteria for mesenchymal stem cells set by the International Society for Cellular Therapy Using our ASCL culture system with MK lineage induction medium without recombinant thrombopoietin led to peak production of platelets within 12xa0days, which may be sufficient for clinical application,Abstract                                    Background                   Severe coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 manifests as a lifethreatening microvascular syndrome The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 uses primarily the capsid spike S protein to engage with its receptors and infect host cells To date, it is still not known if the S protein alone, without the other viral elements, is able to trigger vascular cell signalling and provoke cell dysfunction                                                     Methods                   We investigated the effects of the recombinant, stabilised S protein on primary human cardiac pericytes PCs signalling and function Endpoints included cell viability, proliferation, migration, cooperation with endothelial cells ECs in angiogenesis assays, and release of proinflammatory cytokines Adopting a blocking strategy against the S protein receptors ACE2 and CD147, we explored which receptor mediates the S protein signalling in PCs                                                     Findings                                        We show, for the first time, that the recombinant S protein alone elicits functional alterations in cardiac PCs This was documented as 1 increased migration, 2 reduced ability to support EC network formation on Matrigel, 3 secretion of proinflammatory molecules typically involved in the                     cytokine storm                     , and 4 production of proapoptotic factors responsible for EC death Furthermore, the S protein stimulates the phosphorylationactivation of the extracellular signalregulated kinase 12 ERK12 through the CD147 receptor, but not ACE2, in cardiac PCs Accordingly, the neutralization of CD147, using a blocking antibody, prevented the activation of ERK12 and partially rescued the PC function in the presence of the S protein                                                                        Interpretation                   Our findings suggest the new, intriguing hypothesis that the S protein may elicit vascular cell dysfunction, potentially amplifying, or perpetuating, the damage caused by the whole coronavirus This mechanism may have clinical and therapeutic implication                                                     Funding                   Elizabeth Blackwell Institute EBI Rapid Response COVID19 award                                                     Research in context                                        Evidence before this study                     The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 uses primarily the capsid spike S protein to engage with its receptors and infect host cells Coreceptors and host cell proteases may also be involved Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2 is the wellrecognized entry receptor used by the virus in respiratory epithelial cells it is also abundantly expressed in the human heart Alongside ACE2, CD147 has recently emerged as a novel receptor for SARSCoV2 Yet, it is not clear if SARSCoV2 triggers adverse responses in cardiac vascular mural cells Likewise, no investigation was devoted to verifying if the recombinant S protein alone can mimic the whole virus signalling                                                           Added value of this study                     This study provides the first evidence that the recombinant S protein alone, without the other viral elements, is capable of eliciting cellular signalling in human cardiac pericytes, thereby inducing cell dysfunction In addition, this study proposes CD147 as the leading receptor mediating S protein signalling in cardiac pericytes                                                           Implications of all the available evidence                     These reports imply that fragments of the S protein might be able to elicit vascular cell dysfunction Blocking the CD147 receptor may help protect the vasculature not only from infection, but also from the collateral damage caused by the S protein,In recent years, structural cardiac interventions became an important part of cardiovascular medicine Despite the rapid development and evolution of these interventional techniques, there is axa0significant lack of evidence regarding the optimal antithrombotic treatment strategy as randomized trials on this issue are missing for most of these interventions Thus, this manuscript summarizes the current level of evidence The listed recommendations are based on available data as well as expert opinion and aim to guide physicians in making decisions for the treatment of patients in this setting,In late 2019, a highly pathogenic novel coronavirus CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome SARSCoV2 emerged from Wuhan, China and led to a global pandemic SARSCoV2 has a predilection for the pulmonary system and can result in serious pneumonia necessitating hospitalisation Computed tomography CT chest scans of patients with severe symptoms, show signs of multifocal bilateral ground or groundglass opacities GGO associated with consolidation areas with patchy distribution However, it is less well known that both asymptomatic and mild symptomatic patients may exhibit similar lung changes Presumably, the various pathological changes in the lungs may increase the risk of adverse events during diving eg, lung barotrauma, pulmonary oedema, etc, thus these lung manifestations need to be considered prior to allowing resumption of diving Presently, it is not known how the structural changes in the lungs develop and to what extent they resolve, in particular in asymptomatic carriers and patients with mild disease However, current evidence indicates that a month of recovery may be too short an interval to guarantee complete pulmonary restitution even after COVID19 infections not demanding hospital care,Objective Several COVID19 patients have overlapping comorbidities The independent role of each component contributing to the risk of COVID19 is unknown, and how some noncardiometabolic comorbidities affect the risk of COVID19 remains unclear Methods A retrospective followup design was adopted A total of 1,160 laboratoryconfirmed patients were enrolled from nine provinces in China Data on comorbidities were obtained from the patients medical records Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratio  OR and 95 confidence interval 95 CI of the associations between comorbidities cardiometabolic or noncardiometabolic diseases, clinical severity, and treatment outcomes of COVID19 Results Overall, 158 136 patients were diagnosed with severe illness and 32 27 had unfavorable outcomes Hypertension 287, 130632, type 2 diabetes T2DM 357, 232549, cardiovascular disease CVD 378, 181789, fatty liver disease 753, 1962896, hyperlipidemia 215, 126367, other lung diseases 600, 3011196, and electrolyte imbalance 1040, 3002610 were independently linked to increased odds of being severely ill T2DM 607, 2891275, CVD 847, 6031189, and electrolyte imbalance 1944, 11473296 were also strong predictors of unfavorable outcomes Women with comorbidities were more likely to have severe disease on admission 546, 325919, while men with comorbidities were more likely to have unfavorable treatment outcomes 658, 1462964 within two weeks Conclusion Besides hypertension, diabetes, and CVD, fatty liver disease, hyperlipidemia, other lung diseases, and electrolyte imbalance were independent risk factors for COVID19 severity and poor treatment outcome Women with comorbidities were more likely to have severe disease, while men with comorbidities were more likely to have unfavorable treatment outcomes,SARSCoV2 has created universal disarray since its outbreak in 2019 Emergent measures were taken worldwide to mitigate the morbid outcomes of the pandemic Multiple organ systems have been shown to be negatively impacted secondary to the heightened inflammatory response to the novel virus In this report, we focus on the respiratory system The novel virus impact on the respiratory system has been well documented, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome Here, we present a case of a patient with no risk factors for pneumothoraxxa0smoking, underlying lung disease, prior history of pneumothorax, age, family history who was found to be SARSCoV2 positive and developed a significant pneumothorax requiring transfer to the intensive care unit,BACKGROUND COVID19 counts 46 million people infected and killed more than 12 million Hypoxaemia is one of the main clinical manifestations, especially in severe cases HIF1α is a master transcription factor involved in the cellular response to oxygen levels The immunopathogenesis of this severe form of COVID19 is poorly understood METHODS We performed scRNAseq from leukocytes from five critically ill COVID19 patients and characterized the expression of hypoxiainducible factor1α and its transcriptionally regulated genes Also performed metanalysis from the publicly available RNAseq data from COVID19 bronchoalveolar cells RESULTS Criticallyill COVID19 patients show a shift towards an immature myeloid profile in peripheral blood cells, including band neutrophils, immature monocytes, metamyelocytes, monocytemacrophages, monocytoid precursors, and promyelocytesmyelocytes, together with mature monocytes and segmented neutrophils May be the result of a physiological response known as emergency myelopoiesis These cellular subsets and bronchoalveolar cells express HIF1α and their transcriptional targets related to inflammation CXCL8, CXCR1, CXCR2, and CXCR4 virus sensing, TLR2 and TLR4 and metabolism SLC2A3, PFKFB3, PGK1, GAPDH and SOD2 CONCLUSIONS The upregulation and participation of HIF1α in events such as inflammation, immunometabolism, and TLR make it a potential molecular marker for COVID19 severity and, interestingly, could represent a potential target for molecular therapy Key messages Critically ill COVID19 patients show emergency myelopoiesis HIF1α and its transcriptionally regulated genes are expressed in immature myeloid cells which could serve as molecular targets HIF1α and its transcriptionally regulated genes is also expressed in lung cells from critically ill COVID19 patients which may partially explain the hypoxia related events,OBJECTIVES Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is an emerging viral infection without any approved treatment Investigational therapies for COVID19 may cause clinically important drugdrug interactions DDIs We aimed to study potential DDIs pDDIs and their risk factors in COVID19 patients admitted to the hospital METHODS We conducted a crosssectional study in a tertiary respiratory hospital dedicated to COVID19 patients The LexiInteract database was used to investigate clinically important pDDIs The database output including interacting drug pairs, risk rating, reliability rating, mechanism, and management was evaluated Associations between the occurrence of pDDIs and probable risk factors were assessed by logistic regression analysis RESULTS Medical charts of 227 patients were reviewed About 38 of the patients had at least one clinically important pDDI More than half of the interactions were between protease inhibitors lopinavirritonavir and regularly prescribed medications for the management of comorbidities or COVID19 symptoms eg, atorvastatin, alprazolam, salmeterol, and tamsulosin Ischemic heart disease, chronic respiratory diseases, and ICU admission were significantly associated with the occurrence of pDDIs CONCLUSIONS We recommend considering the risk factors for the emergence of clinically important DDIs in the pharmacotherapy of COVID19 patients Using an alternative medication or dose adjustments may be required in highrisk patients,Cooccurrence of pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum is rare in COVID19 patients Positive airway pressure therapy used to improve oxygenation may sometimes worsen clinical outcomes in some patients with severe COVID19 pneumonia In this case report, we describe an individual who was diagnosed with COVID19 and developed bilateral pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum after initiating noninvasive positive airway pressure therapy,Abstract  Background Heart Failure HF is the leading cause of death worldwide Myocardial fibrosis, one of the clinical manifestations implicated in almost every form of heart disease, contributes significantly to HF development However, there is no approved drug specifically designed to target cardiac fibrosis Nintedanib NTB is an FDA approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis IPF and chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases ILD The favorable clinical outcome of NTB in IPF patients is well established Furthermore, NTB is well tolerated in IPF patients irrespective of cardiovascular comorbidities However, there is a lack of direct evidence to support the therapeutic efficacy and safety of NTB in cardiac diseases   Methods and Results  We examined the effects of NTB treatment on cardiac fibrosis and dysfunction using a murine model of HF Specifically, 10 weeks old C57BL6J male mice were subjected to Transverse Aortic Constriction TAC surgery NTB was administered once daily by oral gavage 50mgkg till 16 weeks postTAC Cardiac function was monitored by serial echocardiography Histological analysis and morphometric studies were performed at 16 weeks postTAC In the control group, systolic dysfunction started developing from 4 weeks postsurgery and progressed till 16 weeks However, NTB treatment prevented TACinduced cardiac functional decline In another experiment, NTB treatment was stopped at 8 weeks, and animals were followed till 16 weeks postTAC Surprisingly, NTBs beneficial effect on cardiac function was maintained even after treatment interruption NTB treatment remarkably reduced cardiac fibrosis as confirmed by Massons trichome staining and decreased expression of collagen genes COL1A1, COL3A1 Compared to TAC group, NTB treated mice showed lower HWTL ratio and cardiomyocyte crosssectional area Our in vitro studies demonstrated that NTB prevents myofibroblast transformation, TGFβ1induced SMAD3 phosphorylation, and production of fibrogenic proteins Fibronectin1 However, NTB significantly altered vital signaling pathways in both, isolated fibroblast and cardiomyocytes, suggesting that its biological effect and underlying cardiac protection mechanisms are not limited to fibroblast and fibrosis alone    Conclusion Our findings provide a proof of concept for repurposing NTB to combat adverse myocardial fibrosis and encourage the need for further validation in large animal models and subsequent clinical development for HF patients,1                 Abstract                                    Background                   Analyses in hospitalized patients and small autopsy series suggest that severe SARSCoV2 infection may affect the heart We investigated heart tissue by in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and RNA sequencing in consecutive autopsy cases to quantify virus load and characterize cardiac involvement in COVID19                                                     Methods                   Left ventricular tissue from 95 deceased with diagnosed SARSCoV2 infection undergoing autopsy was analyzed and clinical data were collected RNA was isolated to examine virus load of SARS CoV2 and its replication in the heart A virus load 1000 copies per µg RNA was defined as relevant Viral RNA and inflammatory cells were assessed using histology RNA sequencing and gene ontology GO enrichment were performed in 10 cases with high cardiac virus load and 10 agematched cases without cardiac infection                                                     Results                                        A relevant SARSCoV2 virus load was detected in 41 out of 95 deceased 43 The median cardiac virus load was 7952 copies per µg RNA IQR 2507, 32 005 In situ hybridization revealed SARS CoV2 RNA primarily in the interstitium or interstitial cells Virus detection was not associated with increased inflammatory cells Relevant cardiac infection was associated with increased expression of the entry factor                     TMPRSS2                      Cardiac virus replication was found in 1495 hearts 15 Remarkably, cardiac virus replication was associated with shorter time between diagnosis and death RNA sequencing revealed clear activation of immune response pathways to virus infection and destruction of cardiomyocytes Hearts with high virus load showed activation of the GO term extracellular exosomes                                                                        Conclusion                   SARSCoV2 infection including virus replication and distinct transcriptomic alterations without signs of myocarditis demonstrate a cardiac involvement In this autopsy series, cardiac replication of SARSCoV2 was associated with early death,Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancerrelated death Over the past 510 years lung cancer outcomes have significantly improved in part due to better treatment options including immunotherapy and molecularly targeted agents Unfortunately, the majority of lung cancer patients do not enjoy durable responses to these new treatments Seminal research demonstrated the importance of the gut microbiome in dictating responses to immunotherapy in melanoma patients However, little is known regarding how other sites of microbiota in the human body affect tumorigenesis and treatment responses The lungs were traditionally thought to be a sterile environment however, recent research demonstrated that the lung contains its own dynamic microbiota that can influence disease and pathophysiology Few studies have explored the role of the lung microbiome in lung cancer biology In this review article, we discuss the links between the lung microbiota and cancer, with particular focus on immune responses, metabolism and strategies to target the lung microbiome for cancer prevention,,Lung ultrasound is a fast and reliable diagnostic tool in the detection of a neonatal pneumothorax This tutorial provides basic information for understanding and detecting the generated artefacts, such as Alines, Blines, and the lung point Essential knowledge of these artefacts allows for rulein and ruleout criteria of a pneumothorax diagnosis Lung ultrasound could help to reduce the use of radiation in neonatology in the future,,Tracheal stenosis in children is a challenge for the healthcare team, since it is a rare disease Patients usually have other clinical comorbidities, mainly previous cardiac surgical interventions This retrospective singlecenter study included infants with tracheal stenosis congenital or acquired operated between 2016 and 2020 on venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation VA ECMO Five patients were operated and the median age of detection of the tracheal disease was 37xa0months, and the median age at the operation was 5xa0months All patients had associated cardiac anomalies Four patients had congenital tracheal stenosis two with associated pig bronchus One patient had acquired subglottic stenosis with concomitant stenosis at the carina After the operation, the patients were referred to ICU on ECMO with an open chest Minor ECMOrelated complications occurred in two patients hemothorax and wound infection All patients required endoscopic evaluation during the postoperative care median of 32 procedures Two patients are currently in followup and three have died Slide tracheoplasty with VAECMO can be successfully performed in infants with prior cardiac surgery Nevertheless, a difficult postoperative course should be anticipated, with possible prolonged ECMO use, readmissions, and higher morbidity and mortality than in children with tracheal stenosis alone,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 SARSCoV2 virus or the coronavirus 2019 COVID19 infection is a novel viral infection causing the 2020 pandemic affecting primarily the respiratory system in the form of influenza like illness, severe acute respiratory illness or asymptomatic respiratory illness and other systems The cardiovascular system may also be affected, with or without a prior history of cardiovascular diseases Myocardial injury is common among patients hospitalized with COVID19 due to stress cardiomyopathy, hypoxic injury, ischemic injury due to cardiac microvascular damage or epicardial coronary artery disease and cytokine storm, however rhythm abnormalities is affected rarely in a transient or severe manner causing rhythm disturbances The concerns about COVID‐19 may result in a delay in proper approach and prompt management in many emergent medical conditions, such as cardiovascular problems Here, we describe our experience with 4 COVID19 patients with varied cardiac manifestations presenting to our hospital during the months of September October 2020,ABSTRACT  While the nasopharynx in the upper respiratory airway is the dominant initial infection site for SARSCoV2, the physiologic mechanism that launches the infection in the lower airway is still not wellunderstood Based on the rapidity with which SARSCoV2 infection progresses to the lungs, it has been conjectured that the nasopharynx acts as the seeding zone for subsequent contamination of the lower airway via aspiration of virusladen boluses of nasopharyngeal fluids In this study, we examine the plausibility of this proposed mechanism To this end, we have developed computational fluid mechanics models of the inhalation process in two medical imaging based airway reconstructions and have quantified the nasopharyngeal liquid volume ingested into the lower airspace during each aspiration The numerical predictions are validated by comparing the number of projected aspirations approximately 2  4 during an eighthour sleep cycle with prior observational findings of 3 aspirations in human subjects Extending the numerical trends on aspiration volume to earlier records on aspiration frequency for the entire day indicates a total aspirated nasopharyngeal liquid volume of 03  076 ml per day We then used sputum assessment data from hospitalized COVID19 patients to estimate the number of virions that are transmitted daily to the lungs via nasopharyngeal liquid boluses For mean sputum viral load, our modeling projects that the number of virions penetrating to the lower airway per day will range over 21 × 10 6  53 × 10 6  for peak viral load, the corresponding number of penetrating virions hovers between 71 × 10 8  179 × 10 8  These findings fill in a key piece of the mechanistic puzzle of the progression from SARSCoV2 infection of the nasopharynx to the development of COVID19 disease within a patient, and point to dysphagia as a potential underlying risk factor for COVID19 The findings also have significant practical implications in the design of COVID19 prophylactics and therapeutics that aim to constrain the pathogenic progress of the disease within the limits of the upper airway,,,BackgroundThe lung CT of COVID19 has characteristic changes, showing scattered groundglass changes extrapulmonary zone However, we observe a case of early infection of COVID19 in a patient who did not show classic CT changes, but shows characteristic pulmonary fibrosisCase presentationWe reported a patient who was infected in the early stage of the COVID epidemic without any treatment The extrapulmonary zone showed symmetrical and diffuse fibrotic changesConclusionsthe lungs of COVID19 may not show scattered groundglass changes, but show symmetrical, diffuse pulmonary fibrosis in extrapulmonary, suggests that there may be other mechanisms other than infection involved in the changes in the lungs,Medical goddesses and gods invoked in the Hippocratic Oath were called on in times of pandemics along with Greek physicians such as Galen of Pergamum Ancient Greek and Roman coinage provide insights into the coexisting religious and rational approaches to medicine rooted in Classical Antiquity, portraying medical symbols and gestures akin to contemporary medicine,,ABSTRACT  Background COVID19 is a new infectious disease with severe disease course and high mortality in some groups Blood tests on admission to the hospital can be useful for stratification of patients and timely correction Our study investigated the clinical features of COVID19 patients in Latvia and differences in blood tests in groups with different disease severity   Methods The retrospective study included 100 patients hospitalized in Riga East Clinical University Hospital in Spring 2020 The severity of the disease course was classified by the presence of pneumonia and its combination with respiratory failure We have assessed blood cells count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, erythrocyte sedimentation rate ESR, Creactive protein CRP, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase LDH, troponin T, electrolytes, creatinine, glomerular filtration rate GFR, Ddimer, prothrombin time, prothrombin index, oxygen saturation, and temperature on admission to the hospital   Results Patients were from 18 to 99 5718 years, 57 males Comorbidities were found in 74 of patients The mild, moderate, and severe groups included 35, 44, and 16 patients, respectively In the severe group, the mortality rate was 50 The progression to severe COVID19 was associated positively with temperature, ESR, CRP, creatinine, LDH, and troponin T and negatively associated with oxygen saturation, eosinophils, and GFR on admission to the hospital   Conclusions COVID19 severity associates with lower renal function and a higher level of inflammation and tissue damage Eosinophils, CRP, ESR, LDH, troponin T, creatinine, and GFR are blood indicators for monitoring patients condition,,,,,OBJECTIVE To investigate the risk factors for acute myocardial injury in coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 patients METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of a COVID19 cohort, in which 149 confirmed COVID19 patients enrolled were divided into the group of myocardial injury 19 cases and the group of nonmyocardial injury 130 cases Myocardial injury was defined according to Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction released by European Society of Cardiology ESC in 2018, that cardiac troponin cTn was above 99th percentile of the reference level Clinical information and results of laboratory tests of the eligible patients were collected Factors associated with myocardial injury in COVID19 patients were evaluated RESULTS Compared with the group of noninjury, the patients in the group of injury were older and had a larger proportion of severe or critical cases P  005, higher respiratory rate and lower percutaneous oxygen saturation SpO2 without oxygen therapy on admission P  005 All inflammatory indexes except for tumor necrosis factor α TNFα showed significant elevation in the patients of the group of injury P  005 Analyzed by Spearman correlation test, we showed that the levels of circulatory cTnI were in positive correlation with the levels of highsensitivity Creactive protein hsCRP, ferritin, receptor of interleukin2 IL2R, interleukin6 IL6 and interleukin8 IL8 ρ  0, P  005 Lower SpO2 without oxygen therapy on admission OR 0860, 95CI 07790949, P0003 and higher plasma IL6 levels OR 1068, 95CI 10191120, P0006 were independent risk factors for acute myocardial injury in the patients with COVID19 by multivariate Logistic regression analyses CONCLUSION Hypoxic state and inflammation may play a key role in the pathogenesis of acute myocardial injury in COVID19 patients,Corresponding Author,,,,Cystic fibrosis CF is an autosomal recessive disease which involves the mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator CFTR gene CF involves in the inflammatory processes and is considered as a multisystem disorder that is not confined to lungs, but it also affects other vital organs that leads to numerous comorbidities The respiratory disorder in the CF results in mortality and morbidity which is characterized by series of serious events involving mucus hypersecretion, microbial infections, airways obstruction, inflammation, destruction of epithelium, tissue remodeling and terminal lung diseases Mucins are the high molecular weight glycoproteins important for the viscoelastic properties of the mucus, play a significant role in the disease mechanisms Determining the functional association between the CFTR and mucins might help to identify the putative target for specific therapeutic approach In fact, furin enzyme which helps in the entry of novel COVID19 virus into the cell, is upregulated in CF and this can also serve as a potential target for CF treatment Moreover, the use of nanoformulations for CF treatment is an area of research being widely studied as they have also demonstrated promising outcomes The indepth knowledge of noncoding RNAs like miRNAs and lncRNAs and their functional association with CFTR gene expression and mutation can provide a different range of opportunity to identify the promising therapeutic approaches for CF,,,We present a case of 68yearold man with diabetes, heart failure, status postcoronary artery bypass grafs, cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator in situ, altered liver function, with corona virus disease 2019 He presented with cough and high grade fever with occasional dyspnea He was treated at home with favipiravir, methyl prednisolone, enoxaparin and antibiotics and home oxygen therapy He retested positive on 14th and 21st day and later on 31st day he was found RTPCR negative for SARSCoV2 Patient came for a followup after 3 months in healthy state with normal Ddimer and other inflammatory markers Birdem Med J 2020 10, COVID Supplement 131134,BackgroundThe burden of COVID19 has been noted to be disproportionately greater in minority women, a population that is nevertheless still understudied in COVID19 research MethodsWe conducted a casecontrol cohort study to examine COVID19associated mortality and cardiovascular disease outcomes after testing henceforth index among a racially diverse adult women veteran population We drew data from a Veterans Affairs VA national COVID19 shared data repository, collected between February and August 2020 KaplanMeier curves and the Cox proportional hazards model were employed to examine the distribution of time to death and the effects of baseline predictors on mortality risk Generalized linear models were used to examine 60day cardiovascular disease outcomes Covariates studied included age, body mass index BMI, and active smoking status at index, and preexisting conditions of diabetes, chronic kidney disease CKD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD, and a history of treatment with antiplatelet or antithrombotic drug at any time in the 2 years prior to the index dateResultsWomen veterans who tested positive for SARSCoV2 had 4 times higher mortality risk than women veterans who tested negative Hazard Ratio 38, 95 Confidence Interval CI 292 to 489 but had lower risk of cardiovascular events Odds Ratio OR 078, 95 CI 066 to 092 and developing new heart disease conditions within 60 days OR 067, 95 CI 058 to 077 Older age, obesity BMI  30, and prior CVD and COPD conditions were positively associated with increased mortality in 60 days xa0Despite a higher infection rate among minority women veterans, there was no significant race difference in mortality, cardiovascular events, or onset of heart disease Conclusions and RelevanceSARSCoV2 infection increased shortterm mortality risk among women veterans similarly across race groups However, there was no evidence of increased cardiovascular disease incidence in 60 days A longer followup of women veterans who tested positive is warranted,Cardiovascular diseases CVDs are the most common cause of mortality worldwide In acute cardiovascular conditions, time is a crucial player in the outcomes of disease management Given the ease and noninvasiveness of obtaining saliva, salivary biomarkers may provide a rapid and efficient diagnosis of CVD Here, we reviewed the published data on the value of salivary molecules for diagnosis of CVD, especially in acute care settings In this review, we show that some biomarkers such as salivary creatinine kinase myocardial band, Creactive protein, troponin1, and myoglobin exhibited promising diagnostic values that were comparable to their serum counterparts Other molecules were also investigated and showed controversial results, including myeloperoxidase, brain natriuretic peptide, and some oxidative stress markers Based on our review, we concluded that the clinical use of salivary biomarkers to diagnose CVD is promising however, it is still in the early stage of development Further studies are needed to validate these findings, determine cutoff values for diagnosis, and compare them to other established biomarkers currently in clinical use,,BACKGROUND Postcardiac arrest patients with a return of spontaneous circulation ROSC are critically ill, and high body mass index BMI is ascertained to be associated with good prognosis in patients with a critically ill condition However, the exact mechanism has been unknown To assess the effectiveness of skeletal muscles in reducing neuronal injury after the initial damage owing to cardiac arrest, we investigated the relationship between estimated lean body mass LBM and the prognosis of postcardiac arrest patients METHODS This retrospective cohort study included adult patients with ROSC after outofhospital cardiac arrest from January 2015 to March 2020 The enrolled patients were allocated into good and pooroutcome groups cerebral performance category CPC scores 12 and 35, respectively Estimated LBM was categorized into quartiles Multivariate regression models were used to evaluate the association between LBM and a good CPC score The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve AUROC was assessed RESULTS In total, 155 patients were analyzed CPC score 12 vs 35, n  70 vs n  85 Patients age, first monitored rhythm, noflow time, presumed cause of arrest, BMI, and LBM were different p  005 Fourthquartile LBM 4898 kg was associated with good neurological outcome of postcardiac arrest patients odds ratio  481, 95 confidence interval CI, 1102555, p  004 Initial high LBM was also a predictor of good neurological outcomes AUROC of multivariate regression model including LBM 0918 CONCLUSIONS Initial LBM above 4898kg is a feasible prognostic factor for good neurological outcomes in postcardiac arrest patients,A previously healthy 20yearold female presented to the emergency room in April 2020 withxa0complaints of shortness of breath, chest pain, and

membranebound protein found on the surface of many human cells Treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors ACEI or angiotensin receptors blockers ARB has been shown to increase angiotensin converting enzyme 2 expression by up to 5fold AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY These findings coupled with observations of the high prevalence and mortality among SARSCoV2infected patients with underlying cardiovascular disease have led to a speculation that ACEIsARBs may predispose to higher risk of being infected with SARSCoV2 Therefore, we systematically reviewed the literature and performed a metaanalysis of the association between prior use of ACEIs and ARBs and the risk of SARSCoV2 infection or hospitalization due to COVID19 disease DATA SOURCES We searched Ovid MEDLINER and Epub Ahead of Print, InProcess  Other NonIndexed Citations and Daily, Ovid Embase, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, Scopus, and Medrxivorg preprint server until June 18, 2020 THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES Ten studies 6 cohorts and 4 case control that enrolled a total of 23,892 patients and 853,369 controls were eligible for inclusion in our metaanalysis One study was excluded from the analysis because of high risk of bias Prior use of ACEIs was not associated with an increased risk of acquiring SARSCoV2 or hospitalization due to COVID19 disease, odds ratio 098, 95 confidence interval 091105, I2  15 Similarly, prior use of ARBs was not associated with an increased risk of acquiring SARSCoV2, odds ratio 104, 95 confidence interval 098110, I2  0 CONCLUSION Cumulative evidence suggests that prior use of ACEIs or ARBs is not associated with a higher risk of COVID19 or hospitalization due to COVID19 disease Our results provide a reassurance to the public not to discontinue prescribed ACEIsARBs because of fear of COVID19,Arrhythmias have been reported frequently in COVID19 patients, but the incidence and nature have not been well characterized Patients admitted with COVID19 and monitored by telemetry were prospectively enrolled in the study Baseline characteristics, hospital course, treatment and complications were collected from the patients medical records Telemetry was monitored to detect the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias The incidence and types of cardiac arrhythmias were analyzed and compared between survivors and nonsurvivors Among 143 patients admitted with telemetry monitoring, overall inhospital mortality was 252 36143 patients during the period of observation mean followup 237 days Survivors were less tachycardic on initial presentation heart rate 906  196 vs 993  231 bpm, p  0030 and had lower troponin peak troponin 003 vs 018 ngml p  0004, Creactive protein peak Creactive protein 97 vs 181 mgdl, p  0029, and interleukin6 levels peak interleukin6 30 vs 246 pgml, p  0003 Sinus tachycardia, the most common arrhythmia detected in 399 57143 of patients, occurred more frequently in nonsurvivors 583 vs 336 in survivors, p  0009 Premature ventricular complexes occurred in 287 41143, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in 154 22143 of patients, with no difference between survivors and nonsurvivors Sustained ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation were not frequent seen only in 14 and 07 of patients, respectively Contrary to reports from other regions, overall mortality was higher and ventricular arrhythmias were infrequent in this hospitalized and monitored COVID19 population Either disease or managementrelated factors could explain this divergence of clinical outcomes, and should be urgently investigated,COVID19 Virus named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 is a pandemic disease characterized with respiratory infection caused by coronavirus It has worldwide after an outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 SARSCoV2 has infected more than 15 million people globally The disease severity and mortality increased in patients with heartrelated comorbidities Cardiovascular disease patients are more susceptible and infected with SARSCoV2 Early screening and managements these patients prevent or ameliorate adverse outcomes Several treatments have been used to combat these effects as previously seen in MERS and SARS This review will cover the association of cardiovascular diseases with COVID 19 It showed that cardiovascular diseases are common in patients with COVID 19 Increased attention to highlight the gaps should be paid to the care of this unique group of patients,,Abstract  Background COVID19 may induce a coagulation dysregulation resulting in a prothrombotic state with a higher risk of arterial and venous thrombosis This abnormal thrombotic diathesis can lead to pulmonary embolism, stroke, and intracardiac thrombosis   Case summary We present two cases of unusual intracardiac thrombosis in patients hospitalized for COVID19 In both cases, imaging tests such as transthoracic echocardiography TTE, computed tomography scan of the chest, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed evidence of unusual intracardiac thrombosis with thrombi adherent to regularly contracting walls   Discussion This evidence confirms that COVID19 induces a hypercoagulable state which can result in intracardiac thrombosis Therefore, TTE is indicated in all COVID19 patients for early diagnosis, and prompt anticoagulant therapy is to be considered as a thromboprophylaxis strategy,,,Application of artificial intelligence techniques in medicine has rapidly expanded in recent years Two algorithms for identification of cardiac implantable electronic devices using chest radiography were recently developed The PacemakerID algorithm, available as a mobile phone application PIDa and a web platform PIDw and The Pacemaker Identification with Neural Networks PPMnn, available via web platform In this study, we assessed the relative accuracy of these algorithms The machine learning algorithms PIDa, PIDw, PPMnn were used to predict device manufacturer using chest Xrays for patients with implanted devices Each prediction was considered correct if predicted certainty was 75 For comparative purposes, accuracy of each prediction was compared to the result using the CARDIAX algorithm 500 Xrays were included from a convenience sample Raw accuracy was PIDa 89, PIDw 73, PPMnn 71 and CARDIAX 85 In conclusion, machine learning algorithms for identification of cardiac devices are accurate at determining device manufacturer, have capacity for improved accuracy with additional training sets and can utilize simple user interfaces These algorithms have clinical utility in limiting potential infectious exposures and facilitate rapid identification of devices as needed for device reprogramming,BACKGROUND Plasma renin activity PRA has been related to allcause mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with cardiovascular disease However, data from patients with acute coronary syndromes ACS are sparse METHODS Determination of PRA was made in 550 patients with ACS, including a subgroup of 287 patients not on treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers or diuretics, and without heart failure We evaluated the relations between PRA and allcause mortality after three years and longterm, and to cardiovascular events after median 87xa0years Adjustments were made for variables that influenced the hazard ratio HRxa0xa05 for the relation between PRA and outcome RESULTS Baseline PRA was associated with allcause mortality during threeyears unadjusted HR 174 per 1 SD increase in logarithmically transformed PRA 95 confidence interval CI 139216, p,,An amendment to this paper has been published and can be accessed via the original article,The cardiac rehab nurse calls out each of our groups blood pressures and pulse rates It is my first posthospitalization class and I am relieved to be in the middle of the pack Although fully aware that numbers are not fate, I cannot help wondering if the worst performers will fully satisfy the dark needs of heart disease statistics I presume that others are making similar calculations, yet wince at the ugly direction of my mind Maybe it is not necessary to do better than another if we take our meds, eat wisely, and exercise to the max, it is possible that our entire group will do well,The severe acute respiratory syndrome novel coronavirus2 pandemic has established a new set of challenges to health care delivery Remotely monitored physiologic sensors on implantable cardiac devices can provide insight into the differential diagnosis of dyspnea in the heart failure population We report on a unique pattern of sensor deviations that seem to occur specifically with severe acute respiratory syndrome novel coronavirus2 infection,Background Cardiac manifestations during Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 SARSCoV2 pandemic have included acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmias, myocarditis, and stress cardiomyopathy However, the combination of cardiomyopathy and negative cardiac biomarkers has not yet been reported Case summary A 49yearold man admitted for respiratory failure secondary to SARSCoV2 developed newonset cardiomyopathy with negative cardiac biomarkers Left ventricular ejection fraction and strain improved 7 days after the initial echocardiogram, after administration of Tocilizumab, coinciding with clinical recovery, and improvement in inflammatory markers Discussion As experience of cardiovascular manifestations of SARSCoV2 increases, more patients will likely present with cardiovascular manifestations the recognition and proper management of these may improve patient outcomes,Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 is associated with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children MISC that ranges from mild symptoms to cardiopulmonary collapse A 5yearold girl presented with shock and a rapid decline in left ventricular function requiring intubation SARSCoV2 was diagnosed by viral Polymerase Chain Reaction PCR, and she received remdesivir and COVID19 convalescent plasma Initial echocardiogram ECHO demonstrated low normal left ventricular function and mild left anterior descending coronary artery dilation She remained hypotensive, despite highdose epinephrine and norepinephrine infusions as well as stressdose hydrocortisone Admission SARSCoV2 IgG assay was positive, meeting the criteria for MISC An ECHO 9xa0hours after admission demonstrated a severe decline in left ventricular function Due to severe cardiogenic shock, she was cannulated for venoarterial extracorporeal support ECMO During her ECMO course, she was treated with remdesivir, intravenous methylprednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulin, and anakinra She was decannulated on ECMO day 7, extubated the following day, and discharged home 2xa0weeks later without respiratory or cardiac support The use of ECMO for cardiopulmonary support for pediatric patients with MISC is feasible and should be considered early as part of the treatment algorithm for patients with severe cardiopulmonary dysfunction,The covid19 disease coronavirus disease 2019 is a novel disease causing a world pandemic Its presentation varies from an asymptomatic infection to a pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome We present a case presenting initially as a covid19 pneumonia together with a disseminated intravascular coagulopathy consisting of arterial and venous thrombosis in different locations and a shock requiring admission in the intensive care unit The abnormal coagulation test in covid19 patients have been described since the first cases observed in Wuhan, China, as well as an increased incidence of venous thrombosis On the contrary, a higher incidence of arterial thrombosis has not been described in these patients The unusual case we present could be a manifestation of this altered tests,OBJECTIVES Painful vasoocclusive episodes VOE are the most common reason for emergency department ED visits experienced by patients with sickle cell disease SCD The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute NHLBI evidencebased recommendations for VOE treatment are based primarily on expert opinion In this randomized controlled trial RCT, we will compare changes in pain scores between patients randomized to a patientspecific analgesic protocol versus those randomized to a weightbased analgesic protocol, as recommended by the NHLBI guidelines METHODS We report the rationale and design of a multisite, phase III, singleblinded, RCT to be conducted in six EDs in the United States Eligible participants will be randomized after providing consent, anticipating 50 of those randomized would have an ED visit during the enrollment period A total of 230 participants with one VOE ED visit provides sufficient power to detect a clinically significant difference in pain score reductions of 14 between groups with 005 type I error Uniquely, this trial randomizes participants in a larger population than the study population, given the impossibility of consenting and randomizing participants during emergencies The primary endpoint is the change in pain scores in the ED from time of placement in treatment area to time of disposition hospitalization, discharged home, or assigned to observation status or a maximum treatment duration of 6xa0hours Additional outcomes include hospitalizations and ED visits seven days post enrollment, side effects, and safety assessments CONCLUSIONS The COMPAREVOE study design will provide highlevel evidence to support the NHLBI VOE treatment guidelines,Anaesthesia,congenital heart disease,echocardiography,hemodynamics,laparoscopic surgery,perioperative care,transesophageal,In 2019, it was reported that changes to asthma management reported in the Global Initiative for Asthma GINA …might be considered the most fundamental changes in asthma management in 30 years These changes refer to the recommendation that the treatment of asthma in adolescents and adults would no longer include shortacting ß2agonist SABA only, but that people with asthma should receive either symptomdriven inhaled corticosteroids ICScontaining treatment mild asthma or daily ICScontaining treatment The fundamental reason for this shift was driven by concerns about the risks and consequences associated with SABAonly treatment, the need to improve the daytoday management of asthma symptoms to prevent exacerbations and emergent evidence These recommendations have subsequently been reinforced and characterized in GINA 2020, and it is reasonable to say that they are significant, not only in terms of an asthma management framework but also as a management approach in practice This opinion article specifically focuses on opportunities and challenges associated with the implementation of GINA 2020 in primary care practice that need to be recognized and addressed if the shift in asthma treatment paradigm is to be successfully implemented into daytoday practice,We are grateful to have the opportunity for an indepth discussion with Nusair 1 and DG Chapman and coworkers We sincerely appreciate their insightful comments on our study about the impaired pulmonary function in coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 patients 2, 3, which helps to interpret the parameters of abnormal lung diffusion capacity more accurately Besides the impaired lung diffusion capacity, impairment of exercise endurance in recovered patients with COVID19 should also be considered httpsbitly3qrzPDY,BACKGROUND This study aimed to evaluate the association between sex and clinical outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease COVID19 using a populationbased dataset METHODS In this retrospective study, insurance claims data from the Korea database were used Patients who tested positive for COVID19 were included in the study All diseases were defined according to the International Classification of Diseases 10th revision During followup, the clinical outcomes, except mortality, were assessed using the electrical codes from the dataset The clinical outcomes noted were hospitalization, the use of inotropics, high flow nasal cannula, conventional oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, development of acute kidney injury, cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, acute heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and disseminated intravascular coagulation after the diagnosis of COVID19 RESULTS A total of 7327 patients were included of these, 2964 patients 405 were men and 4363 patients 595 were women There were no significant differences in the Charlson comorbidity index score between men and women in the same age group The incidence of mortality and clinical outcomes was higher among men than among women The mortality rate was the highest for the populations aged 5064 or 65 years The subgroup analyses for age, diabetes mellitus, or hypertension showed favorable results for patient survival or clinical outcomes for women compared to men CONCLUSION Our populationbased study showed that female patients with COVID19 were associated with favorable outcomes Furthermore, the impact of sex was more evident in patients aged 5064 or 65 years,The aim of this study is to evaluate the blood level of antiheart antibodies AHA and its correlation with clinical outcomes in patients with severe and moderate coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 The study included 34 patients 23 males mean age 602  166 years with COVID19 pneumonia Besides standard medical examination, the AHA blood levels were observed, including antinuclear antibodies, antiendothelial cell antibodies, anticardiomyocyte antibodies AbC, antismooth muscle antibodies ASMA, and cardiac conducting tissue antibodies Median hospital length of stay was 14 13 18 days AHA levels were increased in 25 735 patients Significant correlation p  005 of AHA levels with cardiovascular manifestations r  0459 was found AbC levels correlated with pneumonia severity r  0472, respiratory failure r  0387, need for invasive ventilation r  0469, chest pain r  0374, low QRS voltage r  0415, and levels of Creactive protein r  0360 and lactate dehydrogenase r  0360 ASMA levels were found to correlate with atrial fibrillation r  0414, p  005 Antinuclear antibodies and AbC levels correlated with pericardial effusion r  0721 and r  0745, respectively, p  005 The lethality rate was 88 AbC and ASMA levels correlated significantly with lethality r  0363 and r  0426, respectively, p  005 and were prognostically important AHA can be considered as part of the systemic immune and inflammatory response in COVID19 Its possible role in the inflammatory heart disease requires further investigation,Neutrophil extracellular traps NETs contribute to immunothrombosis and have been associated with mortality in Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID19 We stimulated donor neutrophils with plasma from patients with COVID19 and demonstrate that R406 can abrogate the release of NETs These data provide evidence for how fostamatinib may mitigate neutrophilassociated mechanisms contributing to COVID19 immunopathogenesis,Background The COVID19 pandemic has resulted in a significant reduction in urgent cardiac surgery due to concerns about safety for both patients and care givers The timing of safe cardiac surgery is yet to be clarified in the setting of COVID19 diagnosis Methods Due to the urgency of the cardiac conditions on presentation, we have operated on four patients who exhibited the spectrum of COVID19 disease from asymptomatic to severe COVID19 pneumonia With the evolving knowledge about SARSCoV2 and its genetic determinants as well as the cycle threshold levels obtained from realtime reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, we have attempted to develop a strategy to deal with these patients Results All four patients underwent urgent cardiac surgery following a thorough evaluation and multidisciplinary team approach with guidance based on the virus cycle threshold values obtained by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction Conclusion We have shown that, with thorough preparations, consideration of the significance of the cycle threshold obtained on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and meticulous timing, COVID19 diagnosed patients may undergo open heart surgery safely,During the COVID19 epidemic, our national guidelines have suggested that surgical patients should wear a mask to decrease the potential transmission of COVID19 in the operating room, as long as the condition allows However, so far, there is no study to discuss the influence of wearing a mask on the ventilation and blood oxygenation status in patients of spontaneous breathing with supplementary oxygen through an anesthetic facemask This is a beforeafter study in the same patient, and 10 healthy volunteers were recruited, by testing the arterial blood gas parameters at key time points before and after oxygen inhalation to evaluate the effects of two different supplementary oxygen methods disposable medical mask  anesthetic facemask and anesthetic facemask only on the oxygenation of subjects Our data demonstrated whether wearing a disposable medical mask or not could effectively increase the oxygen supply of the subjects compared with the basic value before oxygen inhalation however, compared with the group without mask, the arterial oxygen partial PaO 2 reduced significantly at each time points when subjects wearing a disposable medical mask There was no significant difference in other parameters, and our data showed that age growth and smoking had no significant effects on the difference of PaO 2 between the groups with and without masks This study demonstrates effective oxygen supplementation through anesthetic facemask in subjects with spontaneous breathing who is wearing a disposable medical mask, whose pulse oxygen saturation and arterial oxygen saturation can reach 100 rapidly, and this provides a theoretical basis for the management of patients with disseminated respiratory diseases to wear masks in the operating room however, the rate and amount of PaO 2 increase are both decreased as compared to those who is not wearing a disposable medical mask during supplementary oxygenation Whether this difference will affect the clinical outcome needs further study,,BACKGROUND While emergency physicians are familiar with the management of hypoxemic respiratory failure, management of mechanical ventilation and advanced therapies for oxygenation in the emergency department have become essential during the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic OBJECTIVE We review the current evidence on hypoxemia in COVID19 and place it in the context of known evidencebased management of hypoxemic respiratory failure in the emergency department DISCUSSION COVID19 causes mortality primarily through the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS, with hypoxemia arising from shunt, a mismatch of ventilation and perfusion Management of patients developing ARDS should focus on mitigating derecruitment and avoiding volutrauma or barotrauma CONCLUSIONS High flow nasal cannula and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation have a more limited role in COVID19 because of the risk of aerosolization and minimal benefit in severe cases, but can be considered Stable patients who can tolerate repositioning should be placed in a prone position while awake Once intubated, patients should be managed with ventilation strategies appropriate for ARDS, including targeting lungprotective volumes and low pressures Increasing positive endexpiratory pressure can be beneficial Inhaled pulmonary vasodilators do not decrease mortality but may be given to improve refractory hypoxemia Prone positioning of intubated patients is associated with a mortality reduction in ARDS and can be considered for patients with persistent hypoxemia Neuromuscular blockade should also be administered in patients who remain dyssynchronous with the ventilator despite adequate sedation Finally, patients with refractory severe hypoxemic respiratory failure in COVID19 should be considered for venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation,Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 has become a major global crisis Preliminary reports have, in general, indicated worse outcomes in diabetes mellitus DM patients, but the magnitude of cardiovascular CV complications in this subgroup has not been elucidated Methods We included 142 patients admitted with laboratoryconfirmed COVID19 from April 1st to May 30th 2020 71 50 had DM We compared baseline demographics and study outcomes between those with or without DM using descriptive statistics Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratio for the study outcomes in DM patients, compared to those without DM, stratified by age, sex and glycaemic control CV outcomes of interest include acute myocarditis, acute heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, newonset atrial fibrillation and composite cardiovascular endpoint consisting of all individual outcomes above Result Mean age was 58xa0years The unadjusted rates were higher in DM patients compared to nondiabetics for the composite cardiovascular endpoint 732 vs 406 p,Background Severe coronavirusinduced disease 2019 COVID19 leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome with an increased risk of venous thromboembolic events To a much lesser extent, arterial thromboembolic events have also been reported in this setting Case summary Here, we describe four different cases of COVID19 infection with ischaemic arterial events, such as a myocardial infarction with high thrombus load, ischaemic stroke on spontaneous thrombosis of the aortic valve, floating thrombus with mesenteric, splenic and renal infarction, and acute limb ischaemia Discussion Cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, and diabetes are comorbidities most frequently found in patients with a severe COVID19 infection and are associated with a higher death rate Our goal is to provide an overview of the clinical spectrum of ischaemic arterial events that may either reveal or complicate COVID19 Several suspected pathophysiological mechanisms could explain the association between cardiovascular events and COVID19 role of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, endothelial dysfunction, activation of coagulation cascade leading to a hypercoagulability state, virusinduced secondary antiphospholipid syndrome We need additional studies of larger size, to estimate the incidence of these arterial events and to assess the efficacy of anticoagulation therapy,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 is a singlestranded, positivesense, enveloped ribonucleic acid RNA virus SARSCoV2 and its associated disease coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 has caused a global pandemic in the year 20192020 COVID19 has caused widespread death, economic burden, and overcrowding of hospitals As of September 2020, there is no reliable pharmacological treatment for patients affected by COVID19 Herein we present a case of a 41yearold Caucasian female who presented to the emergency department with flulike symptoms for the past five days The patient was admitted for COVID19 symptoms and subsequently developed COVID19 associated thrombotic syndrome and ischemic stroke Below, we discuss risk factors, pathology, and rare manifestations resulting from COVID19 infection COVID19 primarily affects the lungs, but a review of the current literature shows limited cases of ischemic stroke and diffuse thrombosis induced by infection of the novel COVID19 in relatively healthy individuals with minimal risk factors,ABSTRACT                                    Many acute and chronic lung diseases affect the distal lung alveoli Although airwayderived human cell lines exist, alveolar epithelial cell AECderived lines are needed to better model these diseases We have generated and characterized novel immortalized cell lines derived from human AECs They grow as epithelial monolayers expressing lung progenitor markers SOX9 and SOX2, with little to no expression of mature AEC markers Cocultured in 3dimensions 3D with lung fibroblasts, the cells form NKX21                                      organoids expressing mature AEC markers AQP5 and GPRC5A Singlecell RNA sequencing of an AEC line in 2D                   versus                   3D revealed increased cellular heterogeneity and induction of cytokine and lipoprotein signaling, consistent with organoid formation Activating WNT and FGF pathways resulted in larger organoids Our approach appears to yield lung progenitor lines that retain a genetic and structural memory of their alveolar cell lineage despite longterm expansion and whose differentiation may be modulated under various 3D conditions These cell lines provide a valuable new system to model the distal lung                   in vitro                   ,The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of an antiviral regimen of protease inhibitors combined with Arbidol umifenovir for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 pneumonia patients The genomic sequence of SARSCoV2 is highly homologous to that of SARSCoV Zhou et al, 2020 Previously published basic and clinical research on antiSARSCoV treatment found that lopinavirritonavir LPVr could improve the prognosis of SARS patients Chan et al, 2003 Chu et al, 2004 Darunavir DRV is another protease inhibitor that blocks the binding of SARSCoV2 to human angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 Omotuyi et al, 2020 The broadspectrum antiviral drug Arbidol umifenovir also shows in vitro antiSARSCoV activity Khamitov et al, 2008,,Cardiac involvement has been reported in children with SARSCoV2 inflammatory syndrome The objectives herein were to assess changes in cardiac parameters and compare cardiac pathologies observed in SARSCoV2 to KawasakiKW and myocarditisMY,Background Statins are the cornerstone of therapy in patients with hyperlipidemia In high risk patients statins are employed for aggressive therapy, however part of the users are intolerant to these drugs The aim of this study was to analyze the undesirable effects of moderate, median and high doses of rosuvastatin in CD1 male mice that received a cholesterolrich diet, focusing in the morphological and functional changes on hepatocyte mitochondria Methods We studied in a mouse model the combined administration of a cholesterolrich diet HD along with a moderate high dose of rosuvastatin Ro 1, 25 or 5 mgKgday during several days Animals n6 were sacrificed, the liver mitochondria were isolated for analysis of respiratory function and microscopic studies The respiratory control state 3state 4 and the O2 expenditure nanoatomsminmg proteins were evaluated Results Rosuvastatin doses higher than 20 mgKgday induced premature death in hypercholesterolemic mice but not in mice with a cholesterolfree diet Doses from 25 to 5 mgKgday also induced morphological and functional alterations in mitochondria but the hypercholesterolemic animals survived longer A dose of 1 mgKgday, which is close to the maximal therapeutic dose employed in humans, did not affect mitochondrial architecture or respiratory function after two months of treatment We analyzed the effect of rosuvastatin on the hepatic tissue where statins are most retained after their administration, and the main site of endogenous cholesterol synthesis Conclusions Our results contribute to understand the undesirable side effects of rosuvastatin in hypercholesterolemic mice, effects that can also be present in human being intolerant to statins,The accelerated growth of commercial flights has resulted in a huge upswing of air travelers over the last few decades, including passengers with a wide range of cardiovascular conditions Notwithstanding the ongoing COVID19 pandemic that has set back the aviation industry for the next 12 years, air travel is expected to rebound fully by 2024 Guidelines and evidencebased recommendations for safe air travel in this group vary, and physicians often encounter situations where opinions and assessments on fitness for flights are sought This article aims to provide an updated suite of recommendations for the aeromedical disposition of passenger with uncommon cardiovascular conditions, such as congenital heart diseases, inflammatory cardiac conditions endocarditispericarditismyocarditis, pulmonary hypertension, and venous thromboembolism In addition, the article also aims to provide practical general guidance for the aeromedical examiner in evaluating, preparing, and optimizing the cardiac status of the patient with cardiovascular ailments for air travel,This case report describes multiple organ failure in a young man with illicit vape use which he did not initially disclose to his health care providers His symptoms were not readily diagnosed until he experienced lung collapse and significant heart failure Treatment plan recommendations varied among health care providers leading to increased anxiety for the patient and his family It was ultimately determined that illicit vape use along with chronic substance abuse contributed to a respiratory virus causing pulmonary collapse The pulmonary virus migrated to the patients heart causing severe restrictive pericarditis ultimately requiring a pericardectomy Assessment, interventions, and followup care occurred during the global Corona19 pandemic of 2020,,,Highlights    • Radiologists should know the atypical CT findings of COVID19 pneumonia as well as the typical ones   • A single focal halosign lesion has never been described before as manifestation of COVID19 pneumonia   • CT halosign could represent a consequence of thrombotic damage of pulmonary microcirculation   • In the setting of asymptomatic patients, unilateral single halosign should alert to the possibility of COVID19 pneumonia,The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 SARSCoV2 which results in coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 has had a devastating impact globally Not much is fully understood about this disease Acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS appears to be the commonest complication among patients with COVID19 However, venous thromboembolism VTE appears to be a common complication among patients with COVID19 even with adequate anticoagulation during hospitalization VTE may confer a poor outcome on its own or may exacerbate other common complications such as ARDS or cardiac injury There are several diagnostic dilemmas with regards confirming VTE among patients with COVID19 as there is a move to reduce the transfer of patients for angiographic studies or even venous Doppler ultrasonography because of the high transmissibility SARSCoV2 There is also the risk of worsening ARDS following fluid administration to prevent contrast nephropathy after angiographic studiesxa0 It is, therefore, crucial to understand the timing of VTE occurrence in the setting of COVID19, identify strategies for early diagnosis of VTE, therapeutic options as well as prognostic implications of VTE in the setting of COVID19,,Metabolic associated fatty liver disease MAFLD, previously termed nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, is the leading global cause of liver disease and is fast becoming the most common indication for liver transplantation The recent change in nomenclature to MAFLD refocuses the conceptualisation of this disease entity to its metabolic underpinnings and may help to spur a paradigm shift in the approach to its management, including in the setting of liver transplantation Patients with MAFLD present significant challenges in the pre, peri and posttransplant settings, largely due to the presence of medical comorbidities that include obesity, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk factors As the community prevalence ofxa0MAFLD increases concurrently with the obesity epidemic, donor liver steatosis is also a current and future concern This review outlines current epidemiology, nomenclature, management issues and outcomes of liver transplantation in patients with MAFLD,BACKGROUND Approximately 65 to 69 million individuals in the United States have heart failure, and the disease costs approximately 436 billion in 2020 This research provides geographical incidence and cost models of this disease in the US and explanatory models to account for hospitals number of heart failure DRGs using technical, workload, financial, geographical, and timerelated variables METHODS The number of diagnoses is forecast using regression constrained and unconstrained and ensemble random forests, extra trees regressor, gradient boosting, and bagging techniques at the hospital unit of analysis Descriptive maps of heart failure diagnosticrelated groups DRGs depict areas of high incidence State and countylevel spatial and nonspatial regression models of heart failure admission rates are performed Expenditure forecasts are estimated RESULTS The incidence of heart failure has increased over time with the highest intensities in the East and center of the country however, several Northern states have seen large increases since 2016 The best predictive model for the number of diagnoses hospital unit of analysis was an extremely randomized tree ensemble predictive R2  086 The important variables in this model included workload metrics and hospital type Statelevel spatial lag models using firstorder Queen criteria were best at estimating heart failure admission rates R2  0816 At the county level, OLS was preferred over any GIS model based on Morans I and resultant R2 however, none of the traditional models performed well R2  0169 for the OLS Gradientboosted tree models predicted 36 of the total sum of squares the most important factors were facility workload, mean cash on hand of the hospitals in the county, and mean equity of those hospitals Online interactive maps at the state and county levels are provided CONCLUSIONS Heart failure and associated expenditures are increasing Costs of DRGs in the study increased 61 billion from 2016 through 2018 The increase in the more expensive DRG 291 outpaced others with an associated increase of 92 billion With the increase in demand and steadystate supply of cardiologists, the costs are likely to balloon over the next decade Models such as the ones presented here are needed to inform healthcare leaders,The necessity of early diagnosis of respiratory diseases, especially in the context of the COVID19 pandemic, by means of pulse oximetric screening and monitoring has been substantiated The expediency of using portable pulse oximeters by therapists and general practitioners has been shown The main respiratory diseases accompanied by respiratory failure, which can be detected in time by pulse oximetry, are the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the obstructive sleep apneahypopnea syndrome Early detection of these diseases is an important task because of the mild symptoms of these diseases in the early stages, and as a result, the prevalence of late diagnosis Special attention is given to the pulse oximetry for COVID19 detection, as this infection is also accompanied by respiratory failure The use of oxygen concentrators and auto CPAP devices for the treatment of respiratory failure as well as rehabilitation has been argued The effectiveness of the appointment of longterm oxygen therapy using oxygen concentrators for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, CPAP therapy using automatic CPAP devices for patients with obstructive sleep apneahypopnea syndrome with mandatory pulse oximetry monitoring has been confirmed The analysis of 120 cases of treatment of moderate and severe COVID19 cases complicated by the pneumonia has been carried out The efficiency of the use of oxygen concentrators for supplying oxygen to patients at a flow rate not more than 5 lmin has been proven It has been found that no more than 10  of patients needed an oxygen flow rate more than 5 lmin At the same time, the possibility of using CPAP devices for noninvasive ventilation of lungs using fullface masks has been shown The expediency of using oxygen concentrators and CPAP devices for the rehabilitation of patients after COVID19 has been noted,,Background The COVID19 pandemic creates new challenges for healthcare, including invasive cardiology Case summary We discuss the case of a 65yearold man who presented with nonST segment elevation myocardial infarction combined with bilateral pneumonia The patient had known severe iliac artery lesions with prior interventions and bilateral subclavian artery occlusions After unsuccessful femoral artery access, the diagnostic angiography and the right coronary artery percutaneous coronary intervention were successfully performed from ultrasoundguided lower superficial temporal artery access Discussion We showed that superficial temporal access can be used as an alternate access site for diagnostic coronary angiography and intervention when standard wrist and femoral access sites are not readily accessible,The coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 has become a global pandemic as declared by World Health Organization WHO In the absence of an effective treatment, different drugs with unknown effectiveness, including antimalarial hydroxychloroquine HCQ, with or without concurrent administration with azithromycin AZM, have been tested for treating COVID19 patients with developed pneumonia However, the efficacy and safety of HCQ andor AZM have been questioned by recent clinical reports Direct effects of these drugs on the human heart remain very poorly defined To better understand the mechanisms of action of HCQ  AZM, we employed bioengineered human ventricular cardiac tissue strip hvCTS and anisotropic sheet hvCAS assays, made with human pluripotent stem cell hPSCderived ventricular cardiomyocytes hvCMs, which have been designed for measuring cardiac contractility and electrophysiology, respectively Our hvCTS experiments showed that AZM induced a dosedependent negative inotropic effect which could be aggravated by HCQ electrophysiologically, as revealed by the hvCAS platform, AZM prolonged action potentials and induced spiral wave formations Collectively, our data were consistent with reported clinical risks of HCQ and AZM on QTc prolongationventricular arrhythmias and development of heart failure In conclusion, our study exposed the risks of HCQAZM administration while providing mechanistic insights for their toxicity Our bioengineered human cardiac tissue constructs therefore provide a useful platform for screening cardiac safety and efficacy when developing therapeutics against COVID19,,Background Studies about the incidence and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 in children are still significantly lower than those in adults Moreover, data on the effect of COVID19 in children with congenital heart disease CHD are limited To the best of our knowledge, this study first reported mortality in a child with CHD who acquired COVID19 Case summary A 16monthold boy presented to the emergency department due to shortness of breath, fever, cough, and poor oral intake He tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 He required mechanical ventilation for rapidly progressing respiratory failure The patient had a large midmuscular ventricular septal defect VSD that was closed percutaneously at the age of 13u2009months Moreover, we followed his hospital sequelae from admission to death Discussion This child had multiple risk factors, including malnutrition and persistent pulmonary hypertension PH after late closure of the VSD The preexisting PH could have been aggravated by the lung condition associated with COVID19 and the respiratory failure triggered by SARSCoV2 infection The patient presented with ventricular systolic dysfunction, elevated troponin serum levels and newly developed trifascicular block, which were indicative of myocardial injury The elevated inflammatory markers and multiorgan dysfunction seem to corroborate multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, which was described recently among paediatric patients with COVID19,,Patients affected by pulmonary arterial hypertension PAH benefit from intensive, continuous clinical monitoring to guide escalation of treatments that carry the potential to improve survival and quality of life During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the need for physical distancing has fueled the expeditious expansion of various telehealth modalities, which may apply in a unique manner to individuals with PAH Performance of objective risk assessments in patients with PAH remotely via telemedical visits and other telehealth mechanisms is unprecedented and not yet rigorously validated The uniquely high risk for rapid deterioration in patients with PAH demands a high degree of sensitivity to detect changes in functional assessments In this review, several telehealth modalities for potential utilization in risk assessment and treatment titration in patients with PAH are explored, yet additional study is needed for their validation with the prepandemic care paradigm,,,The management of cardiac implantable electronic devices after death has become a source of controversy There are no uniform recommendations for such management in Brazil practices rely exclusively on institutional protocols and regional custom When the cadaver is sent for cremation, it is recommended to remove the device due to the risk of explosion and damage to crematorium equipment, in addition to other precautions Especially in the context of the SARSCoV2 pandemic, proper guidance and organization of hospital mortuary facilities and funeral services is essential to minimize the flow of people in contact with bodily fluids from individuals who have died with COVID19 In this context, the Brazilian Society of Cardiac Arrhythmias has prepared this document with practical guidelines, based on international publications and a recommendation issued by the Brazilian Federal Medical Council,Objective of the research to assess the prevalence and course of COVID19 in children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis CF in the Russian Federation Materials and methods up to September 1, 2020, 10 cases of COVID19 in CF patients were registered Results the incidence of COVID19 among children and adolescents with CF up to September 1, 2020 was 3,41000 Asymptomatic course was noted in 3 children, mild  in 5, moderate  in 2 20 with pneumonia The main symptoms were fiver 60  6 children, increased cough  5 50 and fatigue  in 3 children 30, in 2 patients 20 abdominal syndrome All patients received dornase alfa inhalations, two patients received azythromycin for antiinflammatory purposes and permanent antibacterial therapy These factors may play a role in the milder course of COVID19 in children and adolescents with CF,Taking into account the gutlung microbiota axis, the new probiotic treatment methods for COVID19 are currently being discussed There are effective medicinal preparations of domestic manufacture in the Russian Federation, the immobilized probiotics The study was aimed to determine the effectiveness of the mixed immobilized probiotic containing the immobilized B bifidum and lactobacilli L plantarum 100 million CFU per dose or the simple immobilized probiotic containing the immobilized B bifidum 500 million CFU per dose in the complex therapy of patients with COVID19 During the openlabel, prospective, observational study 70 patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID19 received complex treatment which included the immobilized probiotics All patients were discharged from the hospital with imporoved health status, as well as with improved instrumental and laboratory indicators body temperature returned to normal in all patients shortness of breath, cough, feeling of chest tightening, myalgia and headache disappeared the patients regained sense of smell and taste the weakness decreased or disappeared pathognomic symptom for COVID19 The dynamics of clinical, laboratory and instrumental indicators reflecting the course of the novel coronavirus infection demonstrates the effectiveness of the used complex therapy The immobilized probiotics may be recommended for the complex treatment of patients with COVID19,A clinical case of treatment of a 54yearold man with several risk factors, including diabetes, obesity, hypertension, with moderate COVID19 bilateral pneumonia is presented His clinical symptoms and signs at presentation included combinations of fever, nonproductive cough, and shortness of breath Initial chest radiograms faid to show any changes, but chest CT revealed ground glass opacities GGOs with fuzzy contours, parenchyma damage 27  He was treated according to the Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of COVID19 cases the Order of Ministry of Health of Ukraine No 762 After a 12day treatment, the damaged area reduced to 5  with fibrosis,,The ongoing pandemic of COVID19 that started in the Hubei province of China in late December 2019, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus2 SARS CoV2 Globally millions affected by the disease so far The risk of COVID19 severity and its complications increases with age and other comorbidities The course of SARSCoV2 infection or its related complications has yet to be established in patients with sickle cell disease SCD, once more evidence is available It is clear from the available data that the course of COVID19 in patients with SCD is mild to moderate, seldom severe, and rarely fatal Herein we report three known cases of SCD with confirmed COVID19, in whom the course of the disease was mild to moderate and uncomplicated with uneventful recoveries,Ischemic stroke seems to be one of the most serious neurologic complications in patients with COVID19 infection Herein, we report a series of 10 ischemic stroke patients with concomitant COVID19 disease Out of 10, 8 had large infarcts 3 massive middle cerebral artery, 2 basilar artery, 2 posterior cerebral artery, and 1 internal carotid artery infarct territory Two had cardiogenic embolic stroke due to atrial fibrillation Almost half of our patients did not have a vascular risk factor Nine did not have fever and were diagnosed with COVID19 upon admission for stroke Stroke occurred in the first week of respiratory symptoms with moderate pulmonary involvement Most Patients did not have hypoxia and did not establish respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome The blood pressures were low and hemorrhagic transformation did not occur even after antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy Patients had markedly increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase, Creactive protein, and Ddimer Three patients died It seems that ischemic strokes in COVID19 patients tend to occur as large infarct and can be seen in patients with mild to moderate pulmonary involvement,Materials and methods a prospective nonrandomized pilot multicenter study of the informativeness and clinical significance of hemostasis laboratory tests in 1210 patients with COVID19 in disease course, including favorable and unfavorable outcomes, was performed Hemostasis was assessed using clotting tests and Ddimer concentration, thromboelastography TEG and thrombodynamics TD Results comparison of COVID19 laboratory parameters and clinical picture showed that 75 of patients have pronounced activation of the plasma coagulation system upon admission to the hospital Hypercoagulation is recorded in all tests, reaching a maximum in patients with subtotal CT3 and total CT4 lung lesion andor resuscitation patients with a clinical picture of pulmonary embolism and unfavorable outcome Low molecular weight heparins LMWH in a standard dosage leads to suppression of the initial hypercoagulable syndrome in more than half of the patients from 75 to 31 All patients without LMWH laboratory effect developed thrombotic complications For clotting tests, insufficient sensitivity to changes in hemostasis against the background of LMWH was revealed The Ddimer test effectively correlates with the severity and outcomes of COVID19, but is not suitable for the control of heparin therapy, which is associated with the effect of lysis of existing blood clots and the lack of response to a decrease in the coagulation activity of patients Methods of thromboelastography and thrombodynamics effectively record a decrease in the activity of the coagulation system and can be used to control heparin therapy The correlation coefficient between the methods was 0,77 The dynamic indices of Ddimers, TEG and TD in severe patients and, especially, in patients with fatal outcomes revealed the greatest sensitivity to the control of heparin therapy in the Thrombodynamics test, which allows, along with thrombosis, to record hypercoagulable states and the risk of bleeding, which are the outcome of thrombohemorrhagic syndrome in patients with COVID19,Pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating disease, and the pathogenesis of this disease is not completely clear Here, the medical records of 85 Covid19 cases were collected, among which fibrosis and progression of fibrosis were analyzed in detail Next, data independent acquisition DIA quantification proteomics and untargeted metabolomics were used to screen diseaserelated signaling pathways through clustering and enrichment analysis of the differential expression of proteins and metabolites The main imaging features were lesions located in the bilateral lower lobes and involvement in five lobes The closed association pathways were FcγRmediated phagocytosis, PPAR signaling, TRPinflammatory pathways, and the urea cycle Our results provide evidence for the detection of serum biomarkers and targeted therapy in patients with Covid19,BACKGROUND The management of cardiac arrest patients receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation CPR is an essential aspect of emergency medicine EM training At our institution, we have a 1month Resuscitation Rotation designed to augment resident training in managing critical patients The objective of this study is to compare 30day mortality between cardiac arrest patients with resuscitation resident RR involvement versus patients without Our secondary outcome is to determine if RR involvement altered rates of initiating targeted temperature management TTM METHODS This study was conducted at a single site tertiary care Level1 trauma center with an Emergency Department ED census of nearly 130,000 visits per year Data was collected from 01012015 to 01012018 using electronic medical records via query Patients admitted with cardiac arrest were separated into two groups, one with RR involvement and one without Initial rhythm of ventricular fibrillationtachycardia VFIBVTACH, 30day mortality, history of coronary artery disease CAD, and initiation of TTM were compared Statistical analysis was performed RESULTS Out of 885 patient encounters, 91 1028 had RR participation There was no statistical difference in 30day mortality between patients with RR involvement compared to those without 7142 vs 6636 Pxa0xa003613 However, TTM was initiated more in the RR group 2070 vs 886 Pxa0xa000025 Patients who received TTM also had a lower 30day mortality compared to those without TTM 5294 vs 7087 Pxa0xa000020 Patients who were older and had no history of CAD were also noted to have a statistically significant higher 30day mortality All other variables were not statistically significant CONCLUSION Resuscitation resident involvement with the care of cardiac arrest patients had no impact in 30day mortality However, the involvement of RR was associated with a statistically significant increase in the initiation of TTM One limitation is that RR participated in 1028 of the cases analyzed herein, thus the two arms are unbalanced in size Future work may investigate if the increase in TTM in the RR involved cases may portend improved rates of neurologically intact survival or more rapid achievement of goal temperatures,During the COVD19 pandemic, some pediatric patients in many countries around the world experienced a syndrome resembling a severe Kawasaki disease KD, often accompanied by shock Due to the incomplete signs of the classic KD in the era before the present pandemic, in many publications from European countries and the United States, this condition was called «multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children  MISC» or «hyperinflammatory shock» or «Kawasakilike syndrome» This syndrome with a new coronavirus infection is characterized by refractory fever, frequent gastrointestinal symptoms, heart damage including coronary dilation in some patients, and acute left ventricular failure in the majority, increased ESR and CRP levels, neutrophilia, extremely high troponin levels, increased ferritin, AST, ALT, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphate kinase, interleukin6 and interleukin10, coagulopathy with an increase in Ddimer and fibrinogen, thrombocytopenia, sometimes procalcitonin increase The manifestations of a cytokine storm may meet the criteria for secondary hemophagocytic syndrome The mechanism of myocardial damage remains unclear Treatment with highdose intravenous immunoglobulin is effective, and in the presence of signs of hemophagocytic syndrome, dexamethasone or methylprednisolone Further research is needed to understand the pathogenesis, resemblance and differences of this syndrome with classic KD, understanding of heart injuiry and early recognition for the need of urgent care,Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2 is a receptor for cell entry of SARSCoV2, and recombinant soluble ACE2 protein inhibits SARSCoV2 infection as a decoy ACE2 is the carboxypeptidase to degrade angiotensin II Ang II to angiotensin 17 and improves the pathologies of cardiovascular disease and acute lung injury To address whether the carboxypeptidase enzymatic activity of ACE2 is protective against COVID19, we investigated the effects of B38CAP, an ACE2like enzyme, on SARSCoV2induced lung injury Expression of ACE2 protein was significantly downregulated in the lungs of SARSCoV2infected hamsters Recombinant S1 domain or receptorbinding domain RBD of the SARSCoV2 Spike protein also directly downregulated ACE2 expression and elevated Ang II levels and considerably worsened acidinduced lung injury in hamsters Treatment with B38CAP downregulated Spike RBDinduced high Ang II levels, severe inflammation and pulmonary edema through its ACE2like enzymatic activity Consistently, elevated cytokine mRNA levels and impaired lung functions were improved by B38CAP treatment Moreover, in SARSCoV2infected humanized ACE2 transgenic mice, B38CAP significantly improved the pathologies of lung injury, alleviated the cytokine storms and downregulated viral RNA levels These results provide the first experimental in vivo evidence that increasing ACE2like enzymatic activity is a potential and powerful therapeutic strategy for lung pathologies in COVID19,,,,,,,Dear sir, Numerous concerns have arisen during the COVID19 epidemic, chief among them the risk of overlooking other pathologies 13 The issue of late diagnoses and interrupted treatments has be,BackgroundLittle is known about the impact of the global coronavirus disease2019 COVID19 pandemic on patients with cardiovascular disease CVD, the biggest global killer and major risk factor for severe COVID19 infections We aim to explore the indirect consequences of COVID19 on healthrelated quality of life HRQoL of patients with CVD MethodsEightyone adult outpatients with CVD were assessed using the EQ5D, a generic health status instrument with five dimensions mobility, selfcare, usual activities, paindiscomfort, anxietydepression, before and during the pandemic Changes in the EQ5D dimensional responses were compared categorically as well as using the dimensionspecific sumscore range 13, with a higher score indicating worse health The responses and sumscore were compared using the exact test of symmetry and the paired ttest, respectivelyResultsThese patients mean age SD 598 105 926 males 56 New York Heart Association NYHA functional class I had coronary artery disease 69, heart failure 28, or arrhythmias 15 None experienced change in NYHA class between assessments About 30 and 38 of patients reported problems with at least one of the EQ5D dimensions prepandemic and during the pandemic, respectively The highest increase in health problems was reported for anxietydepression 125 prepandemic vs 235 during pandemic pu2009u20090035 with mean domainspecific score from 112 SD 033 to 125 SD 046 standardized

mental health of patients with CVD,The global incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 continues to increase despite health care efforts The disease is caused by coronavirus 2 with high transmission and mortality rates Little is known about the management of COVID19 in advanced liver disease The aim of work was to propose a plan for management of this drastic disease in case of this specific population with review of medications that could be suitable for advanced liver disease All the guidelines and medications available for treatment of COVID19 were reviewed with selection of the less toxic medications that could be used in advanced liver disease Drugs suitable to manage COVID19 in patients with liver disease might include remdesivir intravenously, nitazoxanide  sofosbuvir, ivermectin, tocilizumab, convalescent plasma, and low molecular weight heparin in certain situations Advanced liver disease is associated with portal hypertension and splenomegaly with reduction of blood elements and immune dysfunction and impaired T cell function Thus, when confronted by cytokine storm as an immune response to COVID19, there may be an increase in the mortality rate of these patients Through this review, a plan to treat COVID19 in this special group of patients with advanced cirrhosis is proposed,Thromboembolic complications are well recognized events in Covid19 infection Most of the case fatalities are due to this event Although any blood vessels may be involved, larger vessels are less commonly involved in this process Here we describe a case of thrombosis of the arch of the aorta in association of Covid19 infection in a hospitalized patient The aim was to ensure timely identification and therapeutic intervention to prevent distal thromboembolic sequelae Journal of National Institute of Neurosciences Bangladesh, 202062 143145,,Introduction Preservation of vascular endothelium integrity and maintenance of its full functionality are fundamental aspects in order to avoid both cardiovascular and noncardiovascular diseases Areas covered Although a massive endothelial disruption is a rare condition, caused by acute and uncontrolled inflammatory responses eg the cytokine storm induced by SARSCoV2 infection, more frequently the vascular tree is the first target of slowly progressive inflammatory processes which affect the integrity of endothelium and its barrier function, supporting the onset of atherosclerotic plaque and spreading inflammation This endothelial dysfunction leads to decrease NO biosynthesis, impaired regulation of vascular tone, and increased platelet aggregation Such chronic subclinic inflammation leads to macrophage infiltration in atherosclerotic lesions Therefore, many efforts should be addressed to find useful approaches to preserve vascular endothelium from inflammation In this review, the authors have evaluated the most recent strategies to counteract this pathological condition Expert opinion The therapeutic and nutraceutical approaches represent useful tools to treat or prevent different phases of vascular inflammation In particular, the pharmacological approach should be used in advanced phases characterized by clinical signs of vascular disease, whilst the nutraceutical approach may represent a promising preventive strategy to preserve the integrity of the endothelial tissue,BACKGROUND Despite advances in critical care for acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS, some survivors in the acute phase are unable to wean from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ECMO or mechanical ventilation To date, little is known regarding whether lung transplantation confers a survival benefit for irreversible ARDS METHODS This retrospective study was conducted using the United Network for Organ Sharing database May 2005December 2018 Patients with restrictive lung disease were divided into two groups patients with and without ARDS Propensity score matching identified recipients without ARDS for the control group RESULTS A total of 63 patients with ARDS were waitlisted for lung transplantation, while 39 received a lung transplant after a median waitlist duration of 8xa0days Seventyeight patients were matched as controls In the ARDS group, the median age was 30xa0years, and the median lung allocation score was 884 Among the 39 recipients, 30 769 received ECMO support prior to transplantation Lung transplantation for ARDS and restrictive lung disease showed similar 90day 872 vs 885, pxa0xa080, 1year 821 vs 859, pxa0xa052, and 3year 692 vs 654, pxa0xa094 survival rates CONCLUSIONS Lung transplantation provides acceptable outcomes in selected patients with irreversible ARDS,We thank Drs Kow and Hasan 1 for their comments about our review on the role of angiotensin receptor blockers ARBs in cardiovascular disease CVD risk management 2 Drs Kow and Hasan 1 pre,AIM It remains unclear whether cardiac arrest CA resuscitation generates aerosols that can transmit respiratory pathogens We hypothesize that chest compression and defibrillation generate aerosols that could contain the SARSCoV2 virus in a swine CA model METHODS To simulate witnessed CA

2min cycles of mechanical chest compression and defibrillation without ventilation The diameter 0310u202fμm and quantity of aerosols generated during 45s intervals of noflow and chest compression before and after defibrillation were analyzed by a particle analyzer Aerosols generated from the coughs of 4 healthy human subjects were also compared to aerosols generated by swine RESULTS There was no significant difference between the total aerosols generated during chest compression before defibrillation compared to noflow In contrast, chest compression after defibrillation generated significantly more aerosols than chest compression before defibrillation or noflow 724u202fu202f416u202f×u202f104 vs 123u202fu202f83u202f×u202f104 vs 105u202fu202f112u202f×u202f104 p,Public prophylaxis to decrease the emergence of new daily COVID19 cases is vital Adjuvant TaibUVID nutritional supplements are promising homemade or hospitalmade supplements suggested for rapidly preventing and treating COVID19 pandemic We report here a 44 years old male physician who caught COVID19 infection at hospital in Egypt with confirmed positive nasopharyngeal swab PCR Ethical committee approval and informed patients consent were gained before performing this study Chest Xray revealed increased bronchovascular markings Close followup was done with no treatment given and he was sent for home isolation Few days later, he developed progressive nonproductive cough and a sense of difficult breathing with no associated fever or chest pain An antitussive drug was given to him The patient read about TaibUVID supplements from social media and started to feel improvement after TaibUVID inhalation therapy using the heated solution of nigella sativa and chamomile five times a day He also received a homemade TaibUVID nutritional supplement nigella sativa, chamomile and natural honey five times daily for four consecutive days The next day, he was quite better with mild symptoms Two days later, nasopharyngeal swab PCR was negative while other patients still had positive nasopharyngeal swabs As few attacks of mild cough and breathing difficulty existed, he was admitted to hospital A nasopharyngeal swab PCR was done for him again and the result was negative also Blood gases were normal He had lymphocytosis possibly due to TaibUVID effects that counteract lymphopenia seen in COVID19 patients Biochemical and hematological evaluation were quite normal apart from increased serum chloride and lactate dehydrogenase There was a mild decrease in serum CO2 and alkaline phosphatase Chest CT report revealed symmetrically inflated both lungs with nonspecific focal nodular infiltrates scattered in basal and medial lung segments in left lower lobes with faint ground glass opacities He was discharged home Few days later, he was quite improved with no symptoms and returned to his work comfortably In conclusion, TaibUVID nutritional supplements may be effective in rapidly changing the nasopharyngeal swab PCR from positive to negative TaibUVID nutritional supplements are advisable as a natural, safe and effective prophylaxis to stop COVID19 infectiousness, transmission and emergence of new cases Clinical studies to investigate TaibUVID nutritional benefits are strongly recommended TaibUVID may be promising and recommended for public prophylaxis to decrease emergence of new COVID19 cases,,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2, which causes coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19, has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide Approximately 5 of COVID19 patients who suffer from pneumonia develop critical respiratory failure Here, we report the case of a healthy 52yearold man who had respiratory failure owing to SARSCoV2 infection and was treated using femorofemoral venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation VVECMO and prone position ventilation PPV After this treatment, his blood oxygen levels, chest highresolution computed tomography findings, and clinical parameters significantly improved He was decannulated from VVECMO on day 6 and finally extubated on day 11 To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of SARSCoV2associated acute respiratory distress syndrome that was successfully treated with a combination of femorofemoral VVECMO and PPV,BACKGROUND Lymphocyte count LYM of peripheral blood and some indices of general biochemical analysis had diagnostic and prognostic value for coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19, and the value of other remaining indices is rare METHODS A total of 94 patients with COVID19 were enrolled at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University According to the severity of COVID19, the patients were divided into three groups moderate 49, severe 35, and critical 10, and 40 healthy cases were enrolled in the same period as healthy controls The diagnostic and prognostic value of indices in peripheral blood cell count and general biochemical analysis was analyzed RESULTS Compared with healthy cases, the value differences in peripheral blood analysis in patients with COVID19 were statistically significant p,A 59yearold man presented to the emergency department with recent onset biphasic stridor, dyspnoea and increased work of breathing on the background of prolonged intubation for the novel COVID19 2u2009months previously Flexible laryngoscopy revealed bilateral vocal fold immobility with a soft tissue mass in the interarytenoid region The patients symptoms improved with oxygen therapy, nebulised epinephrine 5u2009mL 110 000 and intravenous dexamethasone 33u2009mg The following morning, the patient was taken to theatre, underwent suspension microlaryngoscopy and found to have bilateral fixation of the cricoarytenoid joints and a large granuloma in the interarytenoid area He underwent cold steel resection of the granuloma and balloon dilatation between the arytenoids, with the hope of mobilising the joints This failed and CO2 laser arytenoidectomy was performed on the left side The stridor had resolved postoperatively, with normalisation of work of breathing and the patient was discharged home on the first postoperative day,Összefoglaló Bevezetés Egy új, számítógép által segített betegmintaasszociációs analízis eredménye szerint a COVID19 tüneteinek kialakításában kiemelt tényezőként jelenik meg a bradikinin Eszerint a bradikinin lebontása lelassul az angiotenzinkonvertáló enzim aktivitásának csökkenése miatt, ami jelentősen megemelkedő bradikininszinthez vezet a tüdőben Nem merült fel azonban a véralvadási faktorok lehetséges szerepe a bradikininviharban, annak ellenére, hogy az idősebb cardiovascularis betegekben aktiválódó XIIes faktor és a C1észterázinhibitor C1INH alacsony szintje nagy mennyiségű bradikinin képződéséhez vezethet Módszer Átfogó irodalmi áttekintés Eredmények 1 A vírus által fertőzött, sérült endotheliumsejtek felülete az a hely, amellyel érintkezve elindulhat a XIIes véralvadási faktor aktivációja  ez serkenti a prekallikreinkallikreinkinin rendszert, és bradikininképződést okoz Ez a folyamat megtörténik a súlyos vese és tüdőkárosodást okozó hantavírusfertőzésekben 2 Idős betegekben az atherosclerosis miatt többszörösen sérült, merev, stiff erek endotheliumfelszínein jóval magasabb lehet a XIIes faktor kontakt úton történő aktivációja, mint a fiatal egyének ereiben Ez a tény egyik oka lehet az idős, cardiovascularis betegek körében tapasztalt magasabb halálozásnak Következtetés Az aktivált XIIes véralvadási faktor célzott gátlása újabb gyógyítási lehetőség lehet a SARSCoV2fertőzött idős betegekben Jelenleg már hatásosnak bizonyult a bradikininképzést gátló C1INHnak, továbbá a bradikininreceptorgátlóknak az adása is Orv Hetil 2020 16150 20992103 SUMMARY  INTRODUCTION Bradykinin was implicated in a new complex model of pathomechanism leading to the symptoms of COVID19 created by a computerassisted association analysis According to this model, the decrease in angiotensinconverting enzyme expression leads to impaired bradykinin elimination and subsequent enrichment in the lungs However, there is no mentioning of the importance of blood coagulation factor XII in increased bradykinin production, in spite of its agedependent activation and the lower level of C1esterase inhibitor C1INH Activated factor XII may be an important contributor to the bradykinin storm in elder cardiovascular patients METHOD Literature review RESULTS 1 Activation of the coagulation factor XII on the surface of SARSCoV2 infected endothelial cells may trigger the prekallikreinkallikreinkinin system producing bradykinin Such process is taking place in hantavirus infections causing severe lung and kidney damages 2 The endothelial system is dysregulated in elderly patients, resulting in potentially higher factor XII activities on the surface of damaged endothelial cells in the stiffened arteries This can contribute to the higher mortality rates in the elderly CONCLUSION The targeted inhibition of activated blood coagulation factor XII may represent a new therapeutic target for COVID19, especially for elder patients Recently, beneficial results have already been observed by the clinical applications of recombinant C1INH and bradykinin receptor antagonists Orv Hetil 2020 16150 20992103,BACKGROUND Cardiac troponin I cTnI and cTnT are the established biomarkers of cardiomyocyte damage and the recommended biomarkers for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction MI Highsensitivity immunochemical diagnostic systems are able to measure the cTn concentrations in the blood of a majority of healthy people At the same time, the concentration of cTn may be increased not only after MI but also because of other pathologies that might affect myocardium This effect reduces the clinical specificity of cTn for MI and may complicate the diagnosis CONTENT This review summarizes the existing information regarding the causes and mechanisms that lead to the increase of cTn concentration in blood and the forms of cTn that are present in circulation after MI or other types of myocardial injury SUMMARY Different etiologies of disease associated with increases of cTn above the 99th percentile and various mechanisms of troponin release from myocardium could result in the appearance of different forms of cTn in blood and provide the first clinical evidence of injury Additional research is needed for the careful characterization of cTn forms that are present in the blood in different clinical settings That knowledge may lead to the development of immunochemical systems that would differentiate certain forms of troponins and possibly certain types of cardiac disease,BACKGROUND Exacerbation of or new onset orthostatic hypotension in perioperative patients can occur There is complex underlying pathophysiology with further derailment likely caused by acute cardiovascular changes associated with surgery The implications for postoperative recovery are unclear, particularly in frail and older patients We retrospectively explored patient notes for evidence of postoperative orthostatic intolerance in relation to preoperative orthostatic hypotension METHODS Supine and 1minute and 3minute standing blood pressure measures obtained from adult patients before mainly general, orthopedic or urogynecology surgery were compared to postoperative outcome, specifically, evidence in patient notes about falls, feeling dizzyunsteady andor fearful to stand Orthostatic hypotension was defined as a 20u2009mmHg or more andor 10u2009mmHg or more fall in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, within 3u2009minutes of standing after lying supine for an electrocardiogram RESULTS Whilst all patients included had a 1minute standing blood pressure assessment Nu2009u2009170, 3minute assessment was performed less commonly Nu2009u2009113 Nevertheless, onequarter 235 Nu2009u200940 of 170 patients had preoperative orthostatic hypotension This was not clearly explained by cardiac or neurological disease or by common medications, but did occur more frequently in older patients and in those aged 65u2009years or more with higher clinical frailty scale scores The COVID19 pandemic reduced the number of patients progressing to surgery within the planned study timescale Nu2009u2009143170 841 Nevertheless, patients with orthostatic hypotension stayed longer in hospital postoperatively and were more likely to have an episode of fall, unsteadiness andor dizziness documented unprompted in their notes CONCLUSIONS These data provide further impetus for research into modifiable perioperative risk factors associated with orthostatic hypotension These risks are not confined to those with a preexisting dysautonomia diagnosis,Acute eosinophilic pneumonia AEP is a rare but severe respiratory syndrome characterized by fever, hypoxemic respiratory failure, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, and pulmonary eosinophilia The most common cause of AEP is idiopathic, but it can be associated with antidepressant medications like sertraline A 76yearold female presented to our ED with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure She had no history of smoking or prior lung disease She did not improve after treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics so a trial of corticosteroids was initiated Her workup was negative for infectious or collagen vascular causes of the respiratory failure She was diagnosed with AEP associated with sertraline Her condition improved with corticosteroid therapy after discontinuation of sertraline This case report highlights AEP as a possible adverse reaction of sertraline Prompt discontinuation of the offending drug is necessary for early recovery,COVID19, also known as Severe Acute Respiratory SyndromeCoronavirus 2 SARSCoV2, is a severe disease It can cause different types of symptoms including shortness of breath, fever, cough, fatigue and sore throat Older adults and people who have severe underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk to develop more complex complications due to the infection Until August 6th, 2020, COVID19 has caused 700, 000 deaths across the Earth however, the actual death number could be higher than 700,000 COVID19s origin is still remained unknown, but the speculation is targeted to bats or pangolins Although COVID19 is a disease target humans respiratory system, based on the research and clinical cases of COVID19, evidence shows that COVID19 can also invade humans central nervous system CNS,A simple 3min educational video viewed before cardiac catheterization significantly improved patient knowledge and alleviated patient anxiety The key characteristics of a good educational video are clarity, simplicity, brevity, and humanity Educational videos may benefit both patients and operators but require continuous evaluation and improvement,SARSCoV2 infection of human airway epithelium activates genetic programs that lead to progressive hyperinflammation in COVID19 patients Here we report on genetic programs activated by interferons and the suppression by Janus kinase JAK inhibitors The angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2 is the receptor for SARSCoV2 and deciphering its regulation is paramount for understanding the cell tropism of SARSCoV2 infection We identified candidate regulatory elements in the ACE2 locus in human primary airway cells and lung tissue Activating histone and promoter marks and Pol II loading characterize the intronic dACE2 and define novel candidate enhancers distal to the genuine ACE2 promoter and within additional introns dACE2, and to a lesser extent ACE2, RNA levels increased in primary cells treated with interferons and this induction was mitigated by JAK inhibitors that are used therapeutically in COVID19 patients Our analyses provide insight into ACE2 regulatory elements and highlight JAK inhibitors as suitable tools to suppress interferonactivated genetic programs in bronchial cells,,According to scientific reports, the main and most common Covid19 symptoms are fever and shortness of breath Therefore, monitoring of vitals such as temperature, breathing and heart rate and blood oxygen saturation is of essence Our team has designed and developed a wristworn wearable device that continuously monitors relevant vital signs with the aim to prioritize and triage Covid19 patients in the Emergency Department,While SARSCoV2 primarily affects the lungs, the virus may be inflicting detriments to the cardiovascular system, both directly through angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 receptor and initiating systemic inflammation Persistent systemic inflammation may be provoking vascular dysfunction, an early indication of cardiovascular disease risk To establish the potential effects of SARSCoV2 on the systemic vasculature in the arms and legs, we performed a crosssectional analysis of young healthy adults control 5 M15 F, 230u2009u200913 y, 167u2009u20099u2009cm, 630u2009u200974u2009kg and young adults who, 34u2009wk prior to testing, had tested positive for SARSCoV2 SARSCoV2 4 M7 F, 202u2009u200911 y, 172u2009u200912u2009cm, 695u2009u2009124u2009kg meansxa0xa0SD Using Doppler ultrasound, brachial artery flowmediated dilation FMD in the arm and single passive limb movement sPLM in the leg were assessed as markers of vascular function Carotidfemoral pulse wave velocity PWVcf was asvsessed as a marker of arterial stiffness FMD was lower in the SARSCoV2 group 271u2009u2009121 compared with the control group 881u2009u2009296 P  001 and when made relative to the shear stimulus SARSCoV2 004u2009u2009002u2009AU, control 013u2009u2009006u2009AU, P  001 The femoral artery blood flow response, as evidenced by the area under the curve, from the sPLM was lower in the SARSCoV2 group 3u2009u200991 mL compared with the control group 118u2009u2009114 mL P  001 PWVcf was higher in the SARSCoV2 group 583u2009u2009062 ms compared with the control group 517u2009u2009066 ms P  001 Significantly lower systemic vascular function and higher arterial stiffness are evident weeks after testing positive for SARSCoV2 among young adults compared with controlsNEW  NOTEWORTHY This study was the first to investigate the vascular implications of contracting SARSCoV2 among young, otherwise healthy adults Using a crosssectional design, this study assessed vascular function 34u2009wk after young adults tested positive for SARSCoV2 The main findings from this study were a strikingly lower vascular function and a higher arterial stiffness compared with healthy controls Together, these results suggest rampant vascular effects seen weeks after contracting SARSCoV2 in young adults,,Background We sought to investigate the trajectory of cardiac catheterizations for acute coronary syndrome ACS and outofhospital cardiac arrest OHCA during the preisolation PI, strictisolation SI, and relaxedisolation RI periods of the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic at three hospitals in Los Angeles, CA, USA Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on adult patients undergoing urgent or emergent cardiac catheterization for suspected ACS or OHCA between January 1, 2020 and June 2, 2020 at three hospitals in Los Angeles, CA, USA We designated January 1, 2020 to March 17, 2020 as the PI COVID19 period, March 18, 2020 to May 5, 2020 as the SI COVID19 period, and May 6, 2020 to June 2, 2020 as the RI COVID19 period Results From PI to SI, there was a significant reduction in mean weekly cases of catheterizations for nonST elevation myocardial infarctionunstable angina NSTEMIUA 829 vs 125, P  0019, with all other clinical categories trending downwards From SI to RI, mean weekly cases of catheterizations for total ACS increased by 17, NSTEMIUA increased by 27, and OHCA increased by 32, demonstrating a rebound effect Conclusions Cardiac catheterizations for ACS and NSTEMIUA exhibited a rebound effect once social isolation was relaxed,BACKGROUND The association between coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 and hypercoagulability has been extensively described, and pulmonary embolism is a recognized complication of COVID19 Currently, the need for computed tomography pulmonary angiogram CTPA relies on the Wells score and serum Ddimer levels However, because COVID19 patients have a different thrombotic and inflammatory milieu, the usefulness of the Wells score deserves further exploration for this patient population We aimed to explore the ability of the Wells score to predict pulmonary embolism in patients with COVID19 METHODS In this retrospective study, patients found to have a CTPA and a COVID19 diagnosis during the same admission were selected for analysis Age and sex, CTPA results, and associated Ddimer levels were entered in a database The Wells score sensitivity and specificity were calculated at different values, and the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve measured RESULTS Of 459 patients with COVID19, 64 had a CTPA and 12 19 had evidence of pulmonary embolism Previous or current evidence of deep vein thrombosis, a Wells score above 4 points, and serum Ddimer levels 5 times above ageadjusted upper normal values were associated with pulmonary embolism However, only 33 of patients with pulmonary embolism had a Wells score of 4 points or higher The area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic showed nondiscriminating values 054 CONCLUSIONS Although a Wells score of 4 or more points predicted pulmonary embolism in our cohort, the outcome can be present even with lower scores,OBJECTIVE To review the virology, immunology, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of the following 3 major zoonotic coronavirus epidemics severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS, and coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 DATA SOURCES Published literature obtained through PubMed database searches and reports from national and international public health agencies STUDY SELECTIONS Studies relevant to the basic science, epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and treatment of SARS, MERS, and COVID19, with a focus on patients with asthma, allergy, and primary immunodeficiency RESULTS Although SARS and MERS each caused less than a thousand deaths, COVID19 has caused a worldwide pandemic with nearly 1 million deaths Diagnosing COVID19 relies on nucleic acid amplification tests, and infection has broad clinical manifestations that can affect almost every organ system Asthma and atopy do not seem to predispose patients to COVID19 infection, but their effects on COVID19 clinical outcomes remain mixed and inconclusive It is recommended that effective therapies, including inhaled corticosteroids and biologic therapy, be continued to maintain disease control There are no reports of COVID19 among patients with primary innate and Tcell deficiencies The presentation of COVID19 among patients with primary antibody deficiencies is variable, with some experiencing mild clinical courses, whereas others experiencing a fatal disease The landscape of treatment for COVID19 is rapidly evolving, with both antivirals and immunomodulators demonstrating efficacy CONCLUSION Further data are needed to better understand the role of asthma, allergy, and primary immunodeficiency on COVID19 infection and outcomes,BACKGROUND Thrombosis and pulmonary embolism appear to be major causes of mortality in hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 patients However, few studies have focused on the incidence of venous thromboembolism VTE after hospitalization for COVID19 METHODS In this multicenter study, we followed 1529 COVID19 patients for at least 45xa0days after hospital discharge, who underwent routine telephone followup In case of signs or symptoms of pulmonary embolism PE or deep vein thrombosis DVT, they were invited for an inhospital visit with a pulmonologist The primary outcome was symptomatic VTE within 45xa0days of hospital discharge RESULTS Of 1529 COVID19 patients discharged from hospital, a total of 228 149 reported potential signs or symptoms of PE or DVT and were seen for an inhospital visit Of these, 13 and 12 received Doppler ultrasounds or pulmonary CT angiography, respectively, of whom only one patient was diagnosed with symptomatic PE Of 51 33 patients who died after discharge, two deaths were attributed to VTE corresponding to a 45day cumulative rate of symptomatic VTE of 02 95CI 0106 nxa0xa03 There was no evidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS in these patients Other deaths after hospital discharge included myocardial infarction nxa0xa013, heart failure nxa0xa09, and stroke nxa0xa09 CONCLUSIONS We did not observe a high rate of symptomatic VTE in COVID19 patients after hospital discharge Routine extended thromboprophylaxis after hospitalization for COVID19 may not have a net clinical benefit Randomized trials may be warranted,A patient affected by COVID19 pneumonia may develop pulmonary hypertension PH and secondary right ventricular RV involvement, due to lung parenchymal and interstitial damage and altered pulmonary haemodynamics, even in nonadvanced phases of the disease This is a consequence of hypoxic vasoconstriction of the pulmonary circulation, the use of positive endexpiratory pressure PEEP in mechanical ventilation, pulmonary endothelial injury, and local inflammatory thrombotic andor thromboembolic processes We report the case of a young man admitted with a diagnosis of COVID19 pneumoniae with PH unrelated to viral infection and in whom partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage PAPVD was eventually diagnosed LEARNING POINTS COVID19 patients, even if previously well, can have pulmonary hypertension due to other causesThe cause of pulmonary hypertension should always be sought and not assumed, even in COVID19 patients,Puropose of the study                     Basing on the previously obtained results on the proven high efficiency of magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the chest organs in the visualization of major lung diseases, in the current period of mass incidence of viral pneumonia VP caused by COVID19, we tried to study the possibility of using MRI OGK to image lung damage in this pathology both in primary detection and for followup reconvalescence control                                                           Material and methods                     MRI of the chest in T1 , T2weighted modes T1w, T2w, also with fat suppression, diffusionweighted, STIRmodes, in the axial and frontal planes, with breath holding, or with automatic synchronization of acquisition with breathing was carriedout in 47 patients with VP of various severity, 32 of them were confirmed by PCR as COVID19, all did have a clinic of pneumonia The control group comprised 15 volunteers, of them 8 nonsmokers, and 7 smokers In 18 patients, an CT study of the chest was also performed, with a step of 05125 mm, with full coverage of the chest and reconstruction of axial and frontal slices, with a comparison of MRI and CT of the chest In 8 patients, MRI of the chest was then performed again, for followup control of clinical recovery There were no deaths among our patients                                                           Results                     The duration of a complete MRI examination of the chest was less than 25 minutes in all cases 21  4 minutes on average, and less than 10 minutes in the chest CT In all cases, MRI imaging of the affected area was achieved using a group of MRI protocols, which included axial T1w and axial and frontal T2w, and lasted  12 minutes, counting the time for laying the patient                                      In normal patients without pathology of the lungs, not smoking, the lung was visualized as a diffuse homogeneous air region with a minimum share interstitial and vascular space In patients  smokers, lung MRI was slightly enhanced in the dorsal parts of both lungs, disorders of airiness and interstitial exudative changes werent present In the acute phase of the disease, pulmonary ventilation disorders and interstitial exudative changes that form the morphological basis of lung damage in COVID19 were visualized as local, corresponding to the location and nature subsegmental, segmental, polysegmental of the pathological focus, both T1w and T2w modes MRI of the chest provided diagnosis of lung pathology in all cases, while the extent of the pathological focus on the MRI image in T2w was 1419 greater than on the CT The correlation of the calculated volume of affected lung tissue between CT and MRI of the chest wasas high as r  095 p  0001 The values of the volume of the affected tissue in T1w and T2w did not differ from each other in the intergroup comparison and correlated strongly and reliably, r  0985 p  0001 MRI in DWI mode showed a sensitivity of 81 3847 in detecting COVIDlung lesions The duration of DWI in all cases was more than 6 minutes, more than twice as long as all other MRI protocols together The volume of pleural effusion, clearly visible with T2VI, in all our cases did not exceed 100 ml In a prospective followup of 8 patients with COVID19, chest MRI ptovided evidencebased visualization of the recovery process in all cases, with a decrease or complete regression of the exudation component                                        Conclusion                     MRI of the chest with respiratory synchronization or with breathholding can be used for early diagnosis of inflammatory lung lesions in COVIDviral pneumonia and for subsequent followup control, is not accompanied by radiation exposure and closely correlates with the results of chest CT recruited as a modern standard for the diagnosis of pneumonia,,Thromboembolic complications are common complications amongst cases of COVID19 worldwide This occurrence has seen a key role of endovascular treatment in managing this potentially fatal complication Endovascular thrombectomy or catheter directed thrombolysis is a fast and effective method for treatment of pulmonary embolisms, especially in the setting of a pandemic However, good workflow and safety measures should be strictly adhered to ensure a favorable outcome of patients and ensure safety of treating personnel,BackgroundNocturnal cough and wheeze are important symptoms when diagnosing any respiratory disease in a child, but objective measurements of these symptoms are not performedMethodsThe aim of our study was to analyze the use of an automated detection system to assess breath sounds objectively in comparison to cough and wheeze questionnaires and to evaluate its feasibility in clinical practiceResultsFortynine recordings of thirtynine children were processed asthma nu2009u200913 cystic fibrosis nu2009u20092 pneumonia nu2009u20095 suspicion of habit cough nu2009u20097 prolonged, recurrent or chronic cough nu2009u200913, and cough and asthma scores were compared to the objective nocturnal recordings Time for audiovalidation of recordings took between 2 and 40u2009min mean 1422u2009min, SD 1072 Accuracy of the automated measurement was higher for cough than for wheezing sounds Nocturnal cough readings but not wheeze readings correlated with some of the corresponding scoresConclusionTo our knowledge this is the first study using a new device to assess nocturnal cough and obstructive breath sounds objectively in children with a wide variety of respiratory diseases The assessment proved user friendly We obtained additional information on nighttime symptoms, which would otherwise have remained obscure Further studies to assess possible diagnostic and therapeutic benefits of this device are needed,The role of the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2 receptor in SARSCoV2 virus infection and disease progression is complex, and the interaction with exercise is being investigated However, the virus binds to ACE2 The paper hypothesizes that exceeding the lactic threshold during exercise would cause, through hypoxia, over expression of ACE2 Vasodilators would prevent hypoxia and implicitly this fact To the complexity of the phenomenon is added the possibility of preventing severe forms of COVID19 through mitochondrial biogenesis induced by exercise As a result, the paper examines the ability of antihypertensives used in combination with exercise to treat cardiovascular disease to prevent ACE2 over expression and to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis Future research is needed, but it is worth mentioning that some such hypertensives have been proposed for the treatment of COVID19,COVID19 is a disease characterized by damage to the lower respiratory tract, development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome, in severe cases — multiple organ failure, including acute heart failure and cardiomyopathy This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed COVID19 pathogenetic therapy and complications prevention agents using the ex vivo isolated lung and heart models Isolated organs of white rats were used for the research the dynamics of functional indicators were analyzed An amino acidpeptide complex APC from a thermally treated milk protein hydrolyzate was used as the experimental COVID19 pathogenetic therapy and complications prevention agent Introduction of the APC to the isolated cardiopulmonary complex perfusate slowed down development of pulmonary edema in the experimental group the organs weight was 15 times less than in the control group p  00158 We have also registered an airway resistance downtrend APC supported contractile activity of the isolated myocardium suffering ischemiareperfusion the growth of the left ventricular end diastolic pressure was 34 smaller than that registered in the control group p  005 The APCs cardioprotective effect relies on the endotheliumdependent mechanisms The ex vivo method is highly informative It allows assessing reactivity of the isolated organs exposed to biologically active substances and determining the possibilities of compensating for functional changes,Sputum induction SI is the gold standard approach to the noninvasive study of airway inflammation The differential count of inflammatory cells for SI allows patients with asthma to be classified according to inflammatory phenotypes and predicted therapeutic responses Since SI involves the generation of aerosols, there is a need to establish a protocol to ensure biosafety in clinical practice during the current COVID19 pandemic The multidisciplinary consensus on SI described in this article was developed by 22 experts in SI from different Spanish hospitals who drew on available scientific evidence in achieving consensuated opinions, compiled by means of an electronic survey We hope that these unified criteria and recommendations will guide health professionals in implementing SI sampling and processing procedures as safely as possible during the COVID19 pandemic,OBJECTIVE To explore the therapeutic effect and the mechanism of the adjuvant treatment with moxibustion on coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 METHODS A total of 95 patients with COVID19 were randomly divided into a moxibustion group 45 cases and a basic treatment group 50 cases The routine treatment of western medicine was applied in the patients of both groups In the moxibustion group, on the base of the treatment of western medicine, moxibustion was applied to Dazhui GV 14, Feishu BL 13, Qihai CV 6 and Zusanli ST 36, once daily and consecutively for 14 days At the end of treatment courses, clinical symptom scores for cough, asthmatic breathing, chest oppression and short breath, as well as their remission rates were compared between the two groups before and after treatment Before and after treatment, the white blood cell WBC count, the levels of creactive protein CRP and interleukin6 IL6 and the absolute number of T lymphocyte subsets, ie , and of the peripheral blood were compared in the patients between the two groups The principal component analysis was adopted to analyze the common data extracted from the above 10 clinical indexes variables and comprehensively evaluate the differences in the therapeutic effect of two regimens RESULTS The clinical symptom scores were all decreased after treatment in both of the moxibustion group and the basic treatment group as compared with those before treatment P005 After treatment, the clinical symptom scores of cough, chest oppression and asthmatic breathing in the moxibustion group were lower significantly than those in the basic treatment group P005 and the remission rates of cough, chest oppression and asthmatic breathing were higher than the basic treatment group P005 After treatment, WBC count was increased as compared with that before treatment in either group P005 and the levels of CRP and IL6 in the moxibustion group were reduced as compared with those before treatment P005 The reducing range of IL6 level in the moxibustion group was larger than the basic treatment group P005 After treatment, the absolute number of , and T lymphocytes was increased as compared with that before treatment in the moxibustion group P005, and its increase range was larger than the basic treatment group P005 The difference value was 3338 for the score of comprehensive evaluation before and after treatment in the moxbustion group, higher obviously than 891 in the basic treatment group CONCLUSION On the base of the routine treatment with western medicine, moxibustion therapy supplemented relieves the clinical symptoms, reduces the levels of inflammatory indexes, ie IL6 and CRP as well as improves the absolute number of peripheral T lymphocyte subsets The clinical therapeutic effect of such regimen with moxibustion supplemented is significantly better than the simple routine treatment of western medicine,,Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 presents with a wide spectrum of symptoms, ranging from patients being asymptomatic to having lifethreatening acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS COVID19 emerged as a pandemic and has led to multiple causalities worldwide A better understanding of the clinical characteristics of the COVID19 patients and their disease course will aid inxa0better management of these patients and hence may positively impact their outcomes as well Methodology This was a retrospective observational study conducted fromxa0April 15, 2020, toxa0August 31, 2020, after gaining institutional review board approval at the University of Lahore Teaching Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan A total of 47 patients with severe disease who had died due to COVID19 during this period were enrolledxa0by the consecutive method Patients were evaluated for their epidemiological, biochemical, clinical, and radiological features The modified Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema mRALExa0score was used to calculate the extent of alveolar opacities and percentages of lung involvement in chest radiographs Furthermore, patients management plans were also evaluated Data were analyzed using SPSS Statisticsxa0version 23 IBM, Armonk, NY Results The mean age of the patientsxa0was 6153 1335 years The maletofemale ratio was 21, and the mean BMI was 2805 352 kgm2 Diabetes was the most prevalent comorbidityxa0among the patients 32, 681, followed by hypertensionxa0six, 128, ischemic heart disease five, 106, and chronic kidney disease four, 85 respectively The predominant symptom observed among patients was cough 95, followed by shortness of breath 93, fever 63, sputum 23, and gastrointestinal symptoms 64 The mean Ddimer was 1,56713 1,90377 ngmL, mean ferritin was 1,73034 1,38235 ngmL, mean Creactive protein CRP was 20259 10497 mgdl, and the mean neutrophiltolymphocyte ratio was 1050 958 Bilateral lung involvement was seen amongxa040 8511 patients whereas unilateral rightxa0lung involvement was reported in three 638 and unilateral left lung involvement in four 851 respectively The mean mRALExa0score for bilateral lung involvementxa0was 1878 489 The mean area radiologically involved in bilateral lung fields was 7212 1845, followed by unilateral right lung involvement ofxa06787 1597, and unilateralxa0left lung involvement of 6138 1795 in the cohort respectively The most common type of radiological pathology was diffuse groundglass opacities, which was observed in 18 38 patients Most patients received antibiotics 39, 6383, while nine 19 received tocilizumab, four 85 had antiviral therapy, and three 64 were given plasma treatment All patients received glucocorticoids and anticoagulation The most common cause of death wasxa0ARDS, which was observed in 12 255 patients Conclusion This study significantly demonstrated that most cases were males abovexa050 years of age with chronic medical comorbidities of diabetes, hypertension, and ischemic heart disease COVID19 has a predilection for multisystem involvement leading to mortality In addition, elevated Ddimer and neutrophiltolymphocyte ratio may be indicative of a poor prognosis A combination of antimicrobials had no positive impact on the outcomes in this cohort It is difficult to predict the efficacy of tocilizumab and remdesivir as only a few patients in the cohort received these drugs,Background Respiratory failure is a lifethreatening complication of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19related acute respiratory distress syndrome Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ECMO in COVID19 might offer promise based on our clinical experience However, few critically ill cases with COVID19 have been weaned off ECMO Case summary A 66yearold Chinese woman presented with fever 389°C, cough, dyspnoea, and headache She had lymphopenia 072u2009×u2009109L and computed tomography findings of groundglass opacities Subsequently, she was confirmed to have respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 infection She was intubated after transfer to the intensive care unit due to respiratory failure and heart failure However, her condition continued to deteriorate rapidly Venoveno ECMO was undertaken for respiratory and cardiac support due to refractory hypoxemic respiratory failure and bradyarrhythmia 45 bpm During hospitalization, she was also administered antiviral treatment, convalescent plasma therapy, and continuous renal replacement therapy She was maintained on ECMO before she had fully recovered from the condition that necessitated ECMO use and had a negative test for the nucleic acids of SARSCoV2 twice Fortynine days later, this patient was weaned from ECMO At the most recent followup visit 3u2009months after weaning from ECMO, she received respiratory and cardiac rehabilitation and did not complain of any discomfort Discussion As far as we know, the longest duration of ECMO treatment in this critical case with COVID19 is supportive of ECMO as the most aggressive form of life support and the last line of defence during the COVID19 epidemic,Background The new βcoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 appears to exhibit cardiovascular pathogenicity through use of angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2 for cell entry and the development of a major systemic inflammation Furthermore, cardiovascular comorbidities increase susceptibility to SARSCoV2 infection and the development of a severe form of COronaVIrus Disease 2019 COVID19 Case summary We describe the case of a COVID19 patient whose inaugural presentation was a refractory cardiac arrest secondary to the destabilization of known, nonsignificant coronary artery disease Patient was supported by venoarterial extracorporeal life support After 12u2009h of support, cardiac function remained stable on low vasopressor support but the patient remained in a coma and brainstem death was diagnosed Discussion Myocardial injury is frequently seen among critically unwell COVID19 patients and increases the risk of mortality This case illustrates several potential mechanisms that are thought to drive the cardiac complications seen in COVID19 We present the potential role of inflammation and ACE2 in the pathophysiology of COVID19,Patients with LBBB of unknown onset presenting with chest pain can pose a diagnostic challenge in the ED while SmithModifiedSgarbossa SMS ECG criteria might facilitate AMI diagnosis We demonstrate a case of a 79yearold man that presented to the ED with chest pain Original Sgarbossa criteria were negative for AMI while SMS criteria were applied showing proportionally excessive discordance between STsegment and preceding Swave thus fulfilling diagnostic criterion for AMI The coronary angiogram showed the total occlusion of the culprit left anterior descending artery In this case, awareness of SMS criteria aided in the early prehospital diagnosis of AMI in the setting of LBBB and impacted the course of treatment,The aim of the work  to study the possibility of introducing ECG quantitative assessment by its digital processing using the software in the real clinical practice to optimize treatment in assessment of drugseffectiveness at the stage of the patients rehabilitation in the time of COVID19 Material and methods The effectiveness of the drugs, used in rehabilitation, was analyzed according to the methodology of our previous study, 78 patients were diagnosed with acute Qmyocardial infarction in comparison with 46 patients who had stable angina II functional class Results Tivortin and Tivorel increase ΔRRSDNN, which is associated with a reduction of the risk of adverse events and activation of the parasympathetic contour, Tivortin optimizes STslope and accelerates transient depression of the STsegment that reduces the risk of death from cardiovascular disease and increases the antiarrhythmic effect, and also, the addition of Tivortin and Tivorel reduces the dispersion of the QT interval, which indicates an antiischemic effect An increasе of ΔRRSDNN index is higher for bisoprolol than for amiodarone and indicates a positive effect, as a decrease of this indicator is a risk factor for overall and cardiac mortality amiodarone stimulates the activation of the parasympathetic contour both drugs reduce the dispersion of QT interval, which indicated antiischemic effect amiodarone less efficiently affects STslope than bisoprolol, but the effect of these drugs is associated with a reduction of adverse events Conclusion The effectiveness of the assessment of the metabolic therapy at the stage of rehabilitation of patients with cardiac pathology using the drugs Tivortin, Tivorel in comparison with amiodarone and bisoprolol has been proved Rehabilitation during the constellation of acute myocardial infarction and COVID19 is complicated by a decrease of the number of admitted patients, more complicated course of the disease during constellation, nonurgent coronary interventions, a large number of complications, and a slowdown in rehabilitation measures,With the rapidly increasing number of patients with chronic disease, numerous recent studies have put great efforts into achieving longterm health monitoring and patient management Specifically, chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease and brain disease can threaten patients health conditions over a long period of time, thus effecting their daily lives Vital health parameters, such as heart rate, respiratory rate, SpO2 and blood pressure, are closely associated with patients conditions Wearable devices and unobtrusive sensing technologies can detect such parameters in a convenient way and provide timely predictions on health condition deterioration by tracking these biomedical signals and health parameters In this paper, we review current advancements in wearable devices and unobtrusive sensing technologies that can provides possible tools and technological supports for chronic disease management Current challenges and future directions of related techniques are addressed accordingly,Older people are at an increased risk of developing respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, asthma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or lung infections Susceptibility to these diseases is partly due to the intrinsic ageing process, characterized by genomic, cellular and metabolic hallmarks and immunosenescence, and is associated with changes in the intestinal microbiota Importantly, in the lungs, ageing is also associated with a dysbiosis and loss of resilience of the resident microbiota and alterations of the gutlung axis Notably, as malnutrition is often observed in the elderly, nutrition is one of the most accessible modifiable factors affecting both senescence and microbiota This article reviews the changes affecting the lung and its resident microbiota during ageing, as well as the interconnections between malnutrition, senescence, microbiota, gutlung axis and respiratory health As the communication along the gutlung axis becomes more permissive with ageing, this review also explores the evidence that the gut and lung microbiota are key players in the maintenance of healthy lungs, and as such, are potential targets for nutritionbased preventive strategies against lung disease in elderly populations,BackgroundIntegration of imaging and clinical parameters could improve the stratification of COVID19 patients on emergency department ED admission We aimed to assess the extent of COVID19 pulmonary abnormalities on chest xray CXR using a semiquantitative severity score, correlating it with clinical data and testing its interobserver agreementMethodsFrom February 22 to April 8, 2020, 926 consecutive patients referring to ED of two institutions in Northern Italy for suspected SARSCoV2 infection were reviewed Patients with reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction positive for SARSCoV2 and CXR images on ED admission were included 295 patients, median age 69u2009years, 199 males Five readers independently and blindly reviewed all CXRs, rating pulmonary parenchymal involvement using a 03 semiquantitative score in 1point increments on 6 lung zones range 018 Interobserver agreement was assessed with weighted Cohens κ, correlations between median CXR score and clinical data with Spearmans ρ, and the MannWhitney U testResultsMedian score showed negative correlation with SpO2 ρ  0242, p  0001, positive correlation with white cell count ρ  0277, p  0001, lactate dehydrogenase ρ  0308, p  0001, and Creactive protein ρ  0367, p  0001, being significantly higher in subsequently dead patients p  0003 Considering overall scores, readers pairings yielded moderate κ  0449, p  0001 to almost perfect interobserver agreement κ  0872, p  0001, with better interobserver agreement between readers of centre 2 up to κ  0872, p  0001 than centre 1 κ  0764, p  0001ConclusionsProposed CXR pulmonary severity score in COVID19 showed moderate to almost perfect interobserver agreement and significant but weak correlations with clinical parameters, potentially furthering CXR integration in patients stratification,Purpose Since the beginning of the Covid 19 outbreak, many signs of the disease have been identified It is known that Covid 19 uses the mouth area as an entrance to the respiratory tract As with all diseases, early diagnosis and treatment is effective in the course of the disease in Covid 19 We aimed to identify the oral lesions of Covid 19 for detecting disease at early stages Methods Seventyfour patients whom detected Covid 19 in their nasopharyngeal swab were included in this study Results Fiftyeight of seventyfour patients had oral lesions Aphthouslike ulcer was the most common oral lesion n 27 Respectively, other findings were erythema n 19 and lichen planus n12 The most common location of lesions was tongue n 23 Respectively, other lesion areas were buccal mucosa n 20, gingiva n11 and palate n4 Conclusion In the study, more than half of Covid 19 patients had oral lesions Therefore, oral evaluation is important in early diagnosis in cases whom suspected Covid 19,,Aim To establish a signature based on hypoxiarelated alternative splicing AS events for lung adenocarcinoma Materials  methods The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Cox approach was used to construct a prognostic model A nomogram that integrates the final AS predictor and stage was created The network of the key AS events andxa0splicing factors was created Results We created a prognostic signature of 11 AS events Moreover, a nomogram that constitutes the pathological stage and risk was exhibited to be greatly effective in estimating the survival likelihood of lung adenocarcinomaxa0patients Conclusion Hereinxa0we developed the firstever signature based on hypoxiarelated AS events with both prognostic predictive power and diagnostic efficacy,Background According to guidelines and bystander skill, two different methods of cardiopulmonary resuscitation CPR are feasible standard CPR SCPR with mouthtomouth ventilations and chest compressiononly CPR COCPR without rescue breathing COCPR appears to be most effective for cardiac causes, but there is a lack of evidence for asphyxial causes of outofhospital cardiac arrest OHCA Thus, the aim of our study was to compare COCPR versus SCPR in adult OHCA from medical etiologies and assess neurologic outcome in asphyxial and nonasphyxial causes Methods Using the French National OHCA Registry RéAC, we performed a multicenter retrospective study over a fiveyear period 2013 to 2017 All adultwitnessed OHCA who had benefited from either SCPR or COCPR by bystanders were included Nonmedical causes as well as professional rescuers as witnesses were excluded The primary end point was 30day neurological outcome in a weighted population for all medical causes, and then for asphyxial, nonasphyxial and cardiac causes Results Of the 8 541 subjects included for all medical causes, 6 742 had a nonasphyxial etiology, including 5 904 of cardiac causes, and 1 799 had an asphyxial OHCA Among all subjects, 86 95 CI 8193 had a good neurological outcome ie cerebral performance category of 1 or 2 Bystanders who performed SCPR began more often immediately 890 95 CI 873905 versus 782 95 CI 772792 and in younger subjects 641u2009years versus 657 pu2009u20090001 In the weighted population, subjects receiving bystanderinitiated COCPR had an adjusted relative risk aRR of 104 95 CI 079138 of having a good neurological outcome at 30u2009days for all medical causes, 128 95 CI 092177 for asphyxial etiologies, 108 95 CI 080146 for nonasphyxial etiologies and 109 95 CI 093128 for cardiacrelated OHCA Conclusions We observed no significant difference in neurological outcome when lay bystanders of adult OHCA initiated COCPR or SCPR, whether the cause was asphyxial or not,Background COVID‐19 is usually mild, but patients can present with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS and circulatory shock Although the symptoms of the disease are predominantly respiratory, involvement of the cardiovascular system is common Patients with heart failure HF are particularly vulnerable when suffering from COVID‐19 Aim of the Review To examine the challenges faced by healthcare organisations, and mechanical circulatory support management strategies available to patients with heart failure, during the COVID19 pandemic Results Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ECMO can be lifesaving in patients with severe forms of ARDS, or refractory cardiocirculatory compromise The Impella RP can provide right ventricular circulatory support for patients who develop right side ventricular failure or decompensation caused by COVID19 complications, including pulmonary embolus HT are reserved for only those patients with a high shortterm mortality LVAD as a bridge to transplant may be a viable strategy to get atrisk patients home quickly Elective LVAD implantations have been reduced and only patients classified as INTERMACS profile 1 and 2 are being considered for LVAD implantation Delayed recognition of LVAD‐related complications, misdiagnosis of COVID‐19, and impaired social and psychological well‐being for patients and families may ensue Remote patient care with virtual or telephone contacts is becoming the norm Conclusions HF incidence, prevalence, and undertreatment will grow as a result of new COVID19related heart disease ECMO should be reserved for highly selected cases of COVID19 with a reasonable probability of recovery Special considerations are needed for patients with advanced HF, including those supported by durable LVADs,,Background Severe coronavirus disease19 COVID19 presents with progressive dyspnea, which results from acute lung inflammatory edema leading to hypoxia As with other infectious diseases that affect the respiratory tract, asthma has been cited as a potential risk factor for severe COVID19 However, conflicting results have been published over the last few months and the putative association between these two diseases is still unproven Methods Here, we systematically reviewed all reports on COVID19 published since its emergence in December 2019 to June 30, 2020, looking into the description of asthma as a premorbid condition, which could indicate its potential involvement in disease progression Results We found 372 articles describing the underlying diseases of 161,271 patients diagnosed with COVID19 Asthma was reported as a premorbid condition in only 2,623 patients accounting for 16 of all patients Conclusions As the global prevalence of asthma is 44, we conclude that either asthma is not a premorbid condition that contributes to the development of COVID19 or clinicians and researchers are not accurately describing the premorbidities in COVID19 patients,Background In addition to the lungs, the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 also affects multiple organs throughout the body The relationship between COVID19 infection and cardiovascular disease, and the mechanisms by which this disease causes damage to the cardiovascular system are unclear Coronary heart disease CHD is one of the common comorbidities of COVID19, but there is insufficient evidence for its clinical features and impact on clinical outcomes The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical characteristics of COVID19 patients with comorbid CHD and the possible risk factors for the occurrence of critical illness Methods A singlecenter, retrospective study was conducted to analyze COVID19 patients admitted to the SinoFrench New City Campus of Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, Hubei Province and treated by the Peking University National Medical Assistance Team between January 29 and March 10, 2020 Patients testing positive for SARSCoV2 viral nucleic acid in nasopharyngeal swab specimens and who had comorbid CHD, were included in the study Clinical data and laboratory test results of eligible patients were collected, and the factors associated with the occurrence of critical illness among these patients were evaluated Results A total of 205 patients were enrolled in this study, including 20 CHD patients and 185 nonCHD patients The mean age was 667 years Compared to nonCHD patients, more CHD patients had comorbid hypertension and diabetes P  005 In terms of laboratory tests, the CHD group did not differ significantly from the nonCHD group in blood routine, blood chemistry, and various inflammatory cytokines More CHD patients experienced myocardial injury 25 vs 81 P  0031 and CHD patients were more likely to progress to critical illness 40 vs 168P  0012 Univariate logistic regression analysis indicated that a history of CHD, occurrence of myocardial injury, high white blood cell WBC count, low lymphocyte count, and elevated levels of Cr, ferritin, IL2R, IL8 at admission were factors associated with the occurrence of critical illness Multivariate regression analysis found that a history of CHDOR3529, 95 CI 103212075, P 0044,high WBC countOR1289, 95 CI 11361463, P0001 and low lymphocyte countOR0215, 95 CI 00750616, P 0004were independent factors for the occurrence of critical illness among COVID19 patients Conclusion COVID19 patients with comorbid CHD commonly exhibited myocardial injury and were prone to developing critical illness Among COVID19 patients, a history of CHD,high WBC count and low lymphocyte count were independent risk factors for the occurrence of critical illness Greater attention and vigilance are needed in this regard during clinical practice,In the Spring of 2020, we launched a rigor and reproducibility curriculum for medical students in research training programs This required class consisted of eight, 2h sessions, which transitioned to remote learning in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 epidemic The class was graded as passfail Flipped classroom techniques, with multiple handson exercises, were developed for firstyear medical students MDPhD nxa0xa09, Clinical and Translational Research Pathway CTRP students nxa0xa09 Four focus groups nxa0xa013 students and individual interviews with the two instructors were conducted in May 2020 From individual interviews with instructors and focus groups with medical students, the course and its components were favorably reviewed Students thought the course was novel, important, relevant, and practicaland teaching strategies were effective eg, short lectures, interactive small group exercises, and projects Most students expressed concerns about lack of time for course preparation Sharper focus and streamlining of preparation work may be required Pre and poststudent selfassessments of rigor and reproducibility competencies showed average postscores ranging from highmoderate to strong understanding nxa0xa011 We conclude that rigor and reproducibility can be taught to firstyear medical students in research pathways programs in a highly interactive and remote format,Abstract  Respiratory diseases account for nearly 25 of all pediatric consultations Acute respiratory infections ARI in infant, children, and adolescent age group are common incidence in India and worldwide ARI need special care and knowledge from physicians to diagnose the exact pathology It is sometimes very challenging to cure In the intrauterine fetal life, gaseous exchange of oxygen and carbondioxide does not occur in lungs as the placenta helps in exchange process After birth hypoxia, temperature fluctuations, hypercapnia, and sensitivities of chemoreceptor play important role in breathing With increasing age, there is expansion in lung volume, multiplication of alveoli and vessels for better and improved lung ventilation The patients can be presented with cough irritation of pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and pleura, rattling due to excessive secretion in tracheabronchial pathway, wheezing audible whistling sound, stridor upper respiratory obstruction by hoarseness, retraction of chest, tachypnea abnormally rapid respiration, and dyspnea difficult breathing As the children cannot expectorate smoothly, there are always higher chances of lower respiratory tract infections like bronchiolitis, pneumonia, lung abscess, etc These infections have to be diagnosed properly with blood investigations pulmonary functions test PFT, bronchoscopy, and imaging Xray or CT scan techniques Arterial blood gas analysis with supportive and definitive line of management is always crucial Serial estimation of Creactive protein CRP can guide the true recovery or deteriorating phases of infections in cumulative disease conditions apart from viable signs and symptoms,Background Arterial hypertension is the most prevalent risk factor for cardiovascular disease in subSaharan Africa Only a few and mostly small randomized trials have studied antihypertensive treatments in people of African descent living in subSaharan Africa MethodsIn this openlabel, threearm, parallel randomized controlled trial conducted at two rural hospitals in Lesotho and Tanzania, we compare the efficacy and costeffectiveness of three antihypertensive treatment strategies among participants aged 18 years The study includes patients with untreated uncomplicated arterial hypertension diagnosed by a standardized office blood pressure  14090mmHg The trial encompasses a superiority comparison between a triple lowdose antihypertensive drug combination versus the current standard of care monotherapy followed by dual treatment, as well as a noninferiority comparison for a dual drug combination versus standard of care with optional dose titration after 4 and 8 weeks for participants not reaching the target blood pressure The sample size is 1268 participants with parallel allocation and a randomization ratio of 212 for the dual, triple and control arms, respectively The primary endpoint is the proportion of participants reaching a target blood pressure at 12 weeks of 13080 mmHg and 14090 mmHg among those aged 65 years and 65 years, respectively Clinical manifestations of endorgan damage and costeffectiveness at 6 months are secondary endpoints DiscussionThis trial will help to identify the most effective and costeffective treatment strategies for uncomplicated arterial hypertension among people of African descent living in rural subSaharan Africa and inform future clinical guidelines on antihypertensive management in the region xa0xa0Trial registrationClinicaltrialsgov, NCT04129840 Registered on 17 October 2019 httpswwwclinicaltrialsgov,Introduction Many reports have stated that patients admitted for COVID19 may also suffer from cardiovascular diseases, suggesting cardiovascular involvement in COVID19 Since there is direct association between electrocardiography ECG data and the prognosis of cardiovascular disease, a systematic literature review was performed in the present study to address this association and make a conclusive agreement on the early diagnostic and prognostic values of ECG in patients with COVID19 Methods Electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, Ovid, Embase, and Google Scholar were searched for COVID19 and ECG using all their equivalents and similar terms as search words Afterwards, the records were limited to English articles and irrelevant documents, as well as articles that reported druginduced cardiac dysfunction or patients with previous history of cardiovascular complications were excluded Results Overall, 31 articles with 2379 patients were found and used for qualitative data extraction Findings showed that there is a significant association between COVID19 infection and ECG findings Also, STsegment changes, T wave inversions, QT prolongation, and atrial fibrillation were found to be early indicators of cardiac involvement of COVID19, which were associated with worse outcomes Conclusion It is recommended to use ECG as a valuable diagnostic and prognostic tool for cardiac evaluation of patients with COVID19,,We report a case of twomonth old with a functionally univentricular heart and parallel circulation who presented to the emergency department with Covid19 and subsequently developed acute respiratory distress syndrome The course of illness, clinical values, and laboratory markers are characterized in this report,BACKGROUND During COVID19 pandemic in Spain, elective procedures were canceled or postponed, mainly due to health care systems overwhelming OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to evaluate the consequences of interrupting invasive procedures in patients with chronic cardiac diseases due to the COVID19 outbreak in Spain METHODS The study population is comprised of 2,158 patients that were pending on elective cardiac invasive procedures in 37 hospitals in Spain on the 14th of March 2020, when a state of alarm and subsequent lockdown was declared in Spain due to the COVID19 pandemic These patients were followedup until April 31th RESULTS Out of the 2,158 patients, 36 17 died Mortality was significantly higher in patients pending on structural procedures 45 vs 08, respectively p 80u2009yearold 51 vs 07, p  II 38 vs 12, p u2009001, and CCSu2009u2009II 42 vs 14, p u2009013, whereas was it was significantly lower in smokers 05 vs 19, p u2009013 Multivariable analysis identified ageu2009u200980, diabetes, renal failure and CCSu2009u2009II as independent predictors for mortality CONCLUSION Mortality at 45u2009days during COVID19 outbreak in patients with chronic cardiovascular diseases included in a waiting list due to cancellation of invasive elective procedures was 17 Some clinical characteristics may be of help in patient selection for being promptly treated when similar situations happen in the future,A 6yearold African boy with multiviral infection including parvovirus B19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was admitted for persistent fever associated with respiratory distress and myocarditis complicated by cardiogenic shock needing ventilatory and inotropic support Coronary aneurysms were also documented in the acute phase Blood tests were suggestive of macrophage activation syndrome He was treated with intravenous immunoglobulins, aspirin, diuretics, dexamethasone, hydroxychloroquine, and prophylactic low molecular weight heparin Normalization of cardiac performance and coronary diameters was noticed within the first days Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, performed 20xa0days after the hospitalization, evidenced mild myocardial interstitial oedema with no focal necrosis, suggesting a mechanism of cardiac stunning related to cytokines storm rather than direct viral injury of cardiomyocytes,Increased survival with left ventricular assist devices LVAD has led to a large number of patients with LVADs presenting for noncardiac surgeries NCS With studies showing that a trained noncardiac anesthesiologist can safely manage these patients when they present for NCS, it is vital that all anesthesiologists understand the LVAD physiology and its implications in various surgeries This is even more relevant during the current pandemic in which these complex cardiopulmonary interactions may be even more challenging in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 The authors describe a case of a patient with COVID19 with an LVAD who needed thoracoscopic decortication for recurrent complex pleural effusion and briefly discuss unique challenges presented and their management,In the description of the analytical clinical data of the patients with COVID19 from difference country In article shows detailed description of the rheological situation in patients with neuropathic during COVID19 This data was compared with results of rheological study in analogical disease group patients without COVID19 The article describes the effect of various anticoagulants on blood rheology, also describing protocols In vivo, in vitro experiments, that studied a range of rheological parameters different anticoagulants Measurement of RBC aggregation, RBC deformities, plasma viscosity were study with innovative technologies, quantitative methods The work presents a scientific focus, after deep and increase research area is able to transport the newest conclusion to the clinical practice to treatment management of COVID19,,,,BACKGROUND The liberal administration of hydroxychloroquinesulphate HCQ to COVID19 patients has raised concern regarding the risk of QTc prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias, particularly when prescribed with azithromycin We evaluated the incidence of QTc prolongation among moderately and severely ill COVID19 patients treated with HCQ and of the existence of concomitant alternative causes METHODS All COVID19 patients treated with HCQ between Mar 1 and Apr 14, 2020 in a tertiary medical centre were included Clinical characteristics and relevant risk factors were collected from the electronic medical records Individual patient QTc intervals were determined before and after treatment with HCQ The primary outcome measure sought was a composite end point comprised of either an increase 60xa0milliseconds ms in the QTc interval compared with pretreatment QTc, andor a maximal QTc interval 500xa0ms RESULTS Ninety patients were included Median age was 65xa0years IQR 5575 and 57 63 were male Thirtynine patients 43 were severely or critically ill Hypertension and obesity were common nxa0xa023 each, 26 QTc prolongation evolved in 14 patients 16 Age 65xa0years, congestive heart failure, severity of disease, Creactive protein level, hypokalaemia and furosemide treatment, were all associated with QTc prolongation Adjusted analysis showed that QTc prolongation was five times more likely with hypokalaemia OR 5, 95 CI, 1320, and three times more likely with furosemide treatment OR 3 95 CI, 101137 CONCLUSION In patients treated with HCQ, QTc prolongation was associated with the presence of traditional risk factors such as hypokalaemia and furosemide treatment,OBJECTIVE Early detection of patients with COVID19 who will need mechanical invasive ventilation MIV may aid in delivering proper care and optimizing the use of limited resources METHODS In this singlecenter retrospective observational study, we aimed to identify simple laboratory parameters that in combination with ferritin a surrogate marker of severe inflammation may help predict early first 48 hours MIV A total of 160 patients with COVID19 in whom serum ferritin, absolute lymphocyte count ALC, platelet count, Creactive protein CRP, and lactate dehydrogenase LDH had been analyzed at admission were included RESULTS We found that ferritin, LDH, ALC, and CRP predicted with 88 accuracy the probability of early MIV Results indicated that LDH showed the greater area under the curve AUC, with a value of 891 Using the AUC, we established cutoff values for clinical application Finally, we developed a classification tree based on LDH for its clinical use CONCLUSION Ferritin, LDH, ALC, and CRP predict with 88 accuracy the probability of early MIV,BackgroundIn December 2019, a new coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARSCoV2 spread from China, causing a pandemic in a very short time The main clinical presentation of SARSCoV2 infection COVID19, coronavirus disease2019 is pneumonia, but several cardiovascular complications may also occur eg, acute coronary syndromes, pulmonary embolism, stroke, arrhythmias, heart failure and cardiogenic shock Direct or indirect mechanisms induced by SARSCoV2 could be implicated in the pathogenesis of these eventsCase presentationWe report herein the third case of COVID19 autoimmune haemolytic anaemia AIHA reported so far, which occurredwithout any other possible explanations in a Caucasian patient The patient also suffered from STelevation myocardial injuryConclusionsBoth complications occurred quite late after COVID19 diagnosis and were probably precipitated by systemic inflammation, as indicated by a significant delayed increase in inflammatory markers, including interleukin6 IL6,As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2infected patients with hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities develop more severe coronavirus disease COVID19 and are at high risk of death, a controversy arose about the use of antihypertensives as angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors ACEis and angiotensin II receptor blockers ARBs Such drugs might increase the expression of the fundamental receptor of this new infectious agent the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2 Preclinical observations indicate that the increase of ACE2 expression or the activity by ACEis and ARBs leads to a greater transformation of angiotensin AngII to Ang17, which is associated with positive effects on cardiovascular and pulmonary pathophysiology This association has been demonstrated in observational studies in patients with cardiovascular pathology and pneumonia It has not been possible to confirm whether users of ACEis or ARBs are more infected by the new coronavirus, due to methodological issues in studies with patients infected with SARSCoV2 However, the use of such antihypertensive treatments in both children and adults might reduce the virulence of infection Therefore, changes in the antihypertensive therapy of patients at risk of contracting COVID19 are not recommended,BackgroundThe COVID19 outbreak requires a permanent adaptation of practices Cardiopulmonary resuscitation CPR is also involved and we evaluated these changes in the management of outofhospital cardiac arrest OHCAMethodsOHCA of medical origins identified from the French National Cardiac Arrest Registry between March 1st and April 31st 2020 COVID19 period, were analysed Different resuscitation characteristics were compared with the same period from the previous year nonCOVID19 periodResultsOverall, 1005 OHCA during the COVID19 period and 1620 during the nonCOVID19 period were compared During the COVID19 period, bystanders and first aid providers initiated CPR less frequently 498 versus 549 difference, u200951 percentage points 95 CI, u200991 to u200912 and 843 vs 887 difference, u200944 percentage points 95 CI, u200971 to u200916 respectively as did mobile medical teams 673 vs 750 difference, u200977 percentage points 95 CI, u2009113 to u200941 First aid providers used defibrillators less often 660 vs 741 difference, u200982 percentage points 95 CI, u2009118 to u200946 Return of spontaneous circulation ROSC and D30 survival were lower during the COVID19 period 195 vs 253 difference, u200958 percentage points 95 CI, u200990 to u200925 and 28 vs 64 difference, u200936 percentage points 95 CI, u200952 to u200919 respectivelyConclusionsDuring the COVID19 period, we observed a decrease in CPR initiation regardless of whether patients were suspected of SARSCoV2 infection or not In the current atmosphere, it is important to communicate good resuscitation practices to avoid drastic and lasting reductions in survival rates after an OHCA,In these challenging times of the pandemic, as coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 has taken over the planet, its complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS have the potential to wipe out a large portion of our population Whereas a serious lack of ventilators, vaccine being months away makes the condition even worse Thats why promising drug therapy is required One of them was suggested in this article It is the angiotensinconverting enzyme2 ACE2 to which the COVID19 virus binds and upon downregulation of which the pulmonary permeability increases and results in the filling of alveoli by proteinaceous fluids, which finally results in ARDS ARDS can be assisted by angiotensinII type1 receptor AT1R blocker and ACE2 upregulator AT1R blocker will prevent vasoconstriction, the proinflammatory effect seen otherwise upon its activation ACE2 upregulation will ensure less formation of angiotensin II, vasodilatory effects due to the formation of angiotensin 17, increased breakdown of bradykinin at lung level Overall, decreased vasoconstriction of vessels supplying lungs and decreased vasodilation of lung tissues will ensure decreased pulmonary permeability and eventually relieve ARDS It should also be considered that all components of the reninangiotensinaldosterone system RAAS are located in the lung tissues A drug with the least plasma protein binding is required to ensure its distribution across these lung tissues Cotinine appears to be a promising candidate for COVID19 induced ARDS It acts across the board and acts as both an AT1R blocker, ACE2 upregulator It also has a weak plasma protein binding that helps to spread through the lung tissues In this review, we summarized that cotinine, along with COVID19 virus replication blocker antivirals, may prove to be a promising therapy for the treatment of COVID19 induced ARDS,Abstract  Objectives The impact of clinical pharmacists on inpatient heart failure HF care has been proven in many studies Evidence regarding the use of mobile apps by pharmacists to achieve positive clinical outcomes in HF is limited The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of a pharmacistled HF patient focus group using mobile appsbased intervention mix   Methods In this prepostexploratory study, using an intervention mix of hospital discharge counselling, MyTherapy app, WhatsApp and occasional phone calls to improve clinical outcomes in HF Patient medication adherence, healthrelated quality of life HRQoL and 30day allcause hospital readmission rate were assessed The Wilcoxon SignedRank Test was used to find statistical significance of improvements in medication adherence and HRQoL using SPSS software version 26   Key findings The intervention mix of initial hospitaldischarge counselling, MyTherapy app, followup with the WhatsApp group and occasional phone calls established an effective communication with patients All 10 patients had improvements in their clinical outcomes Significant improvements in medication adherence and HRQoL were found Zvalue 2810 and Zvalue 2805, respectively 95 confidence interval No patients were readmitted in 30 days or within 3 months of study   Conclusions A pharmacistled HF patient focus group using mobile appsbased intervention mix was found to be effective in improving clinical outcomes in HF patients Further research should be performed on longterm effects of our approach,Sudden deaths in young active people and athletes are distinctly uncommon and frequently related to highly visible cardiovascular conditions including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and congenital coronary anomalies Myocarditis is also a cause of sudden death in the young, but frequently underrecognized clinically, and therefore deserving of the present analysis Two large registries were interrogated for cases of myocarditis, and clinical, demographic, and pathologic findings were assessed Of 97 cases of myocarditis identified, ages were 193  62 years, 76 male, and 58 were physically active at or near the time of death Almost onehalf of the 97 cases 47 had a viral prodrome or symptoms ie, syncope, malaise, chest pain or palpitations Nine were evaluated by cardiologists, but in none was a diagnosis of myocarditis established before death The inflammatory cellular infiltrate was predominantly lymphocytic 67, was most frequently multifocal 59 and involved the conduction system including atrioventricular node, 38 In conclusion, myocarditis is an important but underrecognized cause of sudden death in young people including competitive athletes Clinical diagnosis is difficult because symptoms are nonspecific and often ignored, requiring high index of suspicion for diagnosis Our data support the ACCAHA consensus guidelines recommending removal of individuals with myocarditis from competitive sports during recovery Selective examination of conduction systems showed a number of cases with involvement of myocarditis, suggesting a novel mechanism for sudden death,Abstract The SARSCoV2 virus causes COVID19, an infection capable of causing severe disease and death but which may also be asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic in many individuals While several risk factors, including age, have been described, the mechanisms of this variation are poorly understood Several studies have described associations between blood group and COVID19 severity, while others do not Expression of ABO glycans on secreted proteins and nonerythroid cells is controlled by a fucosyltransferase FUT2 Inactivating mutations result in a nonsecretor phenotype which is known to protect against some viral infections We investigated whether ABO or secretor status was associated with COVID19 severity Data combined from healthcare records and laboratory tests n275 of SARSCoV2 PCR positive patients hospitalised with COVID19, confirmed higher than expected numbers of blood group A individuals compared to O RR124, CI 95 105,147, P00111 There was also a significant association between group A and COVID19related cardiovascular complications RR256, CI 95 143,455, P00011 which is independent of gender Molecular analysis of phenotype revealed that group A patients who are nonsecretors are significantly less likely to be hospitalised than secretors In a larger cohort of 1000 convalescent plasma donors, among whom the majority displayed COVID19 symptoms and only a small minority required hospitalisation, group A nonsecretors were slightly overrepresented Our findings indicate that group A nonsecretors are not resistant to infection by SARSCoV2, but they are likely to experience a less severe form of its associated disease  Key Points    Blood group type A is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular complications in COVID19 patients     FUT2 nonsecretor status reduces the risk of severe COVID19 outcomes in patients with blood group A,ABSTRACT  Patients in the UK at risk of Covid19 pneumonia, but not needing immediate hospital attention, are to be given pulse oximeters to identify a fall in oxygen saturation SaO2 or SpO2 at home A recent finding in Covid19 pneumonia is a dominant reduction in ventilation to perfused alveoli V A Q A mathematical model of gas exchange was used to predict the effect of shunt or reduced V A Q on SaO2 stability inferred from the slope of the PIO2 vs SaO2 curve as it intersected the line representing ambient PIO2 A 1 kPa variation in PIO2 predicted a 15 and 8 change in SpO2 with 15 shunt and 04 V A Q respectively As a consistency check, two patients with preexisting lung disease and 12 hour continuous SpO2 monitoring breathing air had gas exchange impairment analysed in terms of shunt and reduced V A Q The patient with 16 shunt and normal V A Q had a stable but reduced SpO2 circa 931 throughout the 12 hr period The patient with a V A Q reduced to 048 had SpO2 ranging from 7595 during the same period SpO2 monitoring in suspected covid19 patients should focus on SpO2 varying 5 in 30 minutes Such instability in at risk patients is not diagnostic of Covid19 pneumonia but this may be suspected from a dominant reduction in V A Q if episodic hypoxaemia has progressed from a stable SpO2,Abstract  Background Based on the detailed review of available research and case studies reported in reputed international journals, it can be concluded that endothelial damage Endotheliitis both in small and large arteries may be an important factor of morbidity and mortality in COVID19 patients Arterial stiffness due to Endothelial Dysfunction has been established as an independent and specific marker of various chronic cardiovascular diseases   Objective Our objective was to examine functional impairment of the arteries in COVID19 disease and establish the noninvasive measurement of Arterial Stiffness as an independent marker of disease severity   Methods We recorded the Arterial Stiffness of 23 Mild, 21 Moderate and 20 Severe COVID19 patients grouped on latest NIH severity criteria We observed Arterial Stiffness of COVID19 patients with standard parameters like noninvasive CarotidFemoral Pulse Wave velocity cfPWV, AgeNormalized increase in cfPWV ANIcfPWV   Results Moderate and Severe COVID19 patients have extremely elevated arterial stiffness than Mild patients In Mild patients, cfPWV 8291  1392 cms was extremely significantly lower than both Moderate 1067  1525 cms, P 00001 and Severe 1416  2539 cms, P  00001 patients ANIcfPWV in Moderate and Severe patients was significantly higher than Mild patients Mild 1012  1261 cms Moderate 279  1144 cms Severe 5801  2164 cms intergroup P 00001 Conclusion Our findings strongly suggest that arterial stiffness can be an independent and accurate marker for objective risk stratification and therapeutic alleviation of the acute cardiovascular complications like MODS in COVID19,Background As the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 in Wuhan raised public health concerns, many studies were conducted to reveal the risk factors of the disease and predictive prognostic indicators to plan the treatment strategies and commence therapies earlier Although specific parameters, including age, gender, chronic diseases, Ddimer, and neutrophillymphocyteratio play a curial role in COVID19, the association between mortality and the extent of lung involvement in the initial computerized tomography CT scan of patients diagnosed with COVID19 has not been well documented in the literature Objectives We compared two groups CT1 and CT2 in terms of lung involvement in the initial CT of patients admitted to the emergency unit and then hospitallzed with COVID19 Methods Using the digital data system of İzmir Bozyaka Training and Research Hospital, Turkey, subjects diagnosed with COVID19 in April 2020 were retrospectively screened For each of the 90 patients, the initial CT scans on admission were evaluated for the extent of lung involvement and classified as CT1  5 of lung involvement, n 45 and CT2  5 of lung involvement, n 45 Results There was not any statistical significance between two different CT groups regarding mortality and length of stay of patients in hospital with COVID19 P  072 and P  051, respectively Neutrophil counts were found to be statistically significant and higher in CT2 group than the CT1 P  002 group The length of stay in hospital was correlated with age, neutrophillymphocyte ratio NLR, neutrophils, lymphocyte, and only the correlation between length of stay in hospital and age was significant P  001 Conclusions The size of involvement is not a predictive indicator for mortality and length of stay in hospital in patients with COVID19,,BACKGROUND Lung ultrasound LUS has shown to correlate well with the findings obtained by chest computed tomography CT in acutephase COVID19 Although there is a significant correlation between blood biomarkers and CT radiological findings, a potential correlation between biochemical parameters and LUS images is still unknown Our purpose was to evaluate whether mortality can be predicted from either of two lung ultrasound scoring systems LUSS as well as the potential association between lung lesions visualised by LUS and blood biomarkers METHODS We performed a retrospective observational study on 45 patients aged70 years with SARSCoV2 infection who required hospitalisation LUS was carried out at admission and on day 7, when the clinical course was favourable or earlier in case of worsening Disease severity was scored by means of LUSS in 8 LUSS8 and in 12 LUSS12 quadrants LUS and blood draw for inflammatory marker analysis were performed at the same time RESULTS LUSS8 vs LUSS12 predicted mortality in 933 vs 911 of the cases their associated odds ratios OR were 167 95 CI 120231 and 157 95 CI 110223, respectively The association between biochemical parameters and LUSS scores was significant for ferritin the OR for LUSS12 was 1005 95 CI 10011009 and for LUSS8 1005 95 CI 1011, using thresholds for both of them CONCLUSIONS The prognostic capacity of LUSS12 does not surpass that of LUSS8 There is a correlation between ferritin levels and LUSS,Introduction The use of devices that provide continuous positive pressure in the airway has shown improvement in various pathologies that cause respiratory failure In the COVID 19 pandemic episode the use of these devices has become widespread, but, due to the shortage of conventional CPAP devices, alternative devices have been manufactured The objective of this study is to describe the use of these devices, as well as their efficacy Material and methods Data are collected from patients admitted for Pneumonia due to COVID 19 at the IFEMA Field Hospital Data are collected from 23 patients with respiratory failure and need for ventilatory support Results Study carried out on a total of 23 patients, dated admission to IFEMA Alternative CPAP was used in five patients 217, while ventilatory support with a reservoir mask or Ventimask Venturi effect was used in the remaining 18 patients 783 A progressive increase in saturation is observed in those patients in whom alternative CPAP was used from 94 on average to 98 and 99 on average after 30 and 60u202fmin with the mask, respectively, although this change was not significant pu202fu202f0058 and pu202fu202f0122 respectively No significant change in RF was observed at the beginning and end of the measurement in patients who used alternative CPAP pu202fu202f0423, but among those who did not use alternative CPAP pu202fu202f0001 A statistically significant improvement in the variable oxygen saturation  fraction inspired by oxygen is observed in patients who used alternative CPAP pu202fu202f0040 Conclusion The use of these devices has helped the ventilatory work of several patients by improving their oxygenation parameters To better observe the evolution of patients undergoing this therapy and compare them with patients with other types of ventilatory support, further studies are necessary,Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS commonly have dependent atelectasis and heterogeneous lung disease Due to the heterogenous lung volumes seen, the application of positive end expiratory pressure PEEP can have both beneficial and deleterious effects Alternating supine and prone positioning may be beneficial in ARDS by providing more homogenous distribution of PEEP and decreasing intrapulmonary shunt In pediatrics, the pediatric acute lung injury and consensus conference PALICC recommended to consider it in severe pediatric ARDS PARDS Manually prone positioning patients can be burdensome in larger patients In adults, the use of rotational beds has eased care of these patients There is little published data about rotational bed therapy in children Therefore, we sought to describe the use of a rotational bed in children with PARDS We performed a retrospective case series of children who utilized a rotational bed as an adjunctive therapy for their PARDS Patient data were collected and analyzed Descriptive statistical analyses were performed and reported Oxygenation indices OI pre and postprone positioning were analyzed Twelve patients with PARDS were treated with a rotational bed with minimal adverse events There were no complications noted Three patients had malfunctioning of their arterial line while on the rotational bed Oxygenation indices improved over time in 11 of the 12 patients included in the study while on the rotational bed Rotational beds can be safely utilized in pediatric patients In larger children with PARDS, where it may be more difficult to perform a manual prone position, use of a rotational bed can be considered a safe alternative,,In this study, we developed ACE2specific, peptidederived 68Galabeled radiotracers, based on the hypotheses that 1 ACE2 is an important determinant of SARSCoV2 susceptibility, and 2 that modulation of ACE2 in COVID19 drives severe organ injury Methods A series of NOTAconjugated peptides derived from the known ACE2 inhibitor DX600 were synthesized, with variable linker identity Since DX600 bears two cystine residues, both linear and cyclic peptides were studied A commercially available ACE2 inhibition assay was used to identify lead compounds, which were used to synthesize 68Gachelated peptide radiotracers 68GaNOTAACE2pep The aminocaproatederived radiotracer 68GaNOTAACE2pep4 was subsequently studied in a humanized ACE2 hACE2 transgenic model, with in vivo results correlated with ACE2 activity Results Cyclic DX600 derived peptides had markedly lower IC50s than their linear counterparts, a result confirmed by TCEP reduction of disulfide bridges The three cyclic peptides derived from triglycine, aminocaproate, and polyethylene glycol linkers had calculated IC50s similar to, or lower than the parent DX600 molecule Peptides were readily labeled with 68Ga, and the normal biodistribution of 68GaNOTAACE2pep4 was determined in a hACE2 transgenic murine cohort Pharmacologic concentrations of coadministered NOTAACE2pep blocking showed significant reduction of 68GaNOTAACE2pep4 signals in the in the heart, liver, lungs, and small intestine Ex vivo hACE2 activity in these organs was confirmed as a correlate to in vivo results Conclusions NOTAconjugated, cyclic peptides derived from the known ACE2 inhibitor DX600 retain their activity when Nconjugated for 68Ga chelation In vivo studies in a transgenic hACE2 murine model using the lead tracer 68GaNOTAACE2pep4 showed specific binding in the heart, liver, lungs and intestine organs known to be affected in SARSCoV2 infection These results suggest that 68GaNOTAACE2pep4 may detect organspecific suppression of ACE2 in SARSCoV2 infected murine models and COVID19 patients,BACKGROUND The regulation of cerebral blood flow is critical for normal brain functioning, and many physiological and pathological conditions can have longterm impacts on cerebral blood flow However, minimally invasive tools to study chronic changes in animal models are limited NEW METHOD We developed a minimally invasive surgical technique cyanoacrylate skull, CAS allowing us to image cerebral blood flow longitudinally through the intact mouse skull using laser speckle imaging RESULTS With CAS we were able to detect acute changes in cerebral blood flow induced by hypercapnic challenge We were also able to image cerebral blood flow dynamics with laser speckle imaging for over 100 days Furthermore, the relative cerebral blood flow remained stable in mice from 30 days to greater than 100 days after the surgery COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS Previously, achieving continuous longterm optical access to measure cerebral blood flow in individual vessels in a mouse model involved invasive surgery In contrast, the CAS technique presented here is relatively noninvasive, as it allows stable optical access through an intact mouse skull CONCLUSIONS The CAS technique allows researcher to chronically measure cerebral blood flow dynamics for a significant portion of a mouses lifespan This approach may be useful for studying changes in blood flow due to cerebral pathology or for examining the therapeutic effects of modifying cerebral blood flow in mouse models relevant to human disease,BACKGROUND Cardiogenic shock CS is a systemic disorder associated with dismal shortterm prognosis Given its timedependent nature, mechanical circulatory support may improve survival Intraaortic balloon pump IABP had gained widespread use because of the easiness to implant and the low rate of complications however, a randomized trial failed to demonstrate benefit on mortality in the setting of acute myocardial infarction Acute decompensated heart failure with cardiogenic shock ADHFCS represents a growing resourceintensive scenario with scant data and indications on the best management However, a few data suggest a potential benefit of IABP in this setting We present the design of a study aimed at addressing this research gap METHODS AND DESIGN The Altshock2 trial is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, openlabel study with blinded adjudicated evaluation of outcomes Patients with ADHFCS will be randomized to early IABP implantation or to vasoactive treatments The primary end point will be 60 days patients survival or successful bridge to heart replacement therapy The key secondary end point will be 60day overall survival 60day need for renal replacement therapy inhospital maximum inotropic score, maximum duration of inotropicvasopressor therapy, and maximum sequential organ failure assessment score Safety end points will be inhospital occurrence of bleeding events Bleeding Academic Research Consortium 3, vascular access complications and systemic noncerebral embolism The sample size for the study is 200 patients IMPLICATIONS The Altshock2 trial will provide evidence on whether IABP should be implanted early in ADHFCS patients to improve their clinical outcomes,Circadian rhythms follow a 24xa0h day and night cycle, regulate vital physiological processes, and are especially relevant to cardiovascular growth, renewal, repair, and remodeling A recent flurry of clinical and experimental studies reveals a profound circadian influence on immune responses in cardiovascular disease The first section of this review summarizes the importance of circadian rhythms for cardiovascular health and disease The second section introduces the circadian nature of inflammatory responses The third section combines these to elucidate a new role for the circadian system, influencing inflammation in heart disease, especially myocardial infarction Particular focus is on circadian regulation of the NACHT, LRR, and PYD domainscontaining protein 3 inflammasome, neutrophils, monocytesmacrophages, and T cells involved in cardiac repair A role for biological sex is noted The final section explores circadian influences on inflammation in other major cardiovascular conditions Circadian regulation of inflammation has profound implications for benefitting the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of patients with cardiovascular disease,Background The Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic is a worldwide health crisis Limited information is available regarding which patients will experience more severe disease symptoms We evaluated hospitalized patients who were initially diagnosed with moderate COVID19 for clinical parameters and radiological feature that showed an association with progression to severecritical symptomsMethods This study, a retrospective singlecenter study at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, enrolled 243 patients with confirmed COVIDxad19 pneumonia Forty of these patients progressed from moderate to severecritical symptoms during follow up Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between moderate and severecriticaltype symptoms Univariable and multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify the risk factors associated with symptom progressionResults Patients with severecritical symptoms were older p0001 and more often male p0046 A combination of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD and high maximum chest computed tomography CT score was associated with disease progression Maximum CT score 11 had the greatest predictive value for disease progression The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0861 95 confidence interval 08110902Conclusions Maximum CT score and COPD were associated with patient deterioration Maximum CT score 11 was associated with severe illness,Background  The COVID19 pandemic has resulted in increased admissions with respiratory failure and there have been reports of oxygen failure and shortages of machines to deliver ventilation and Continuous Positive Airway Pressure CPAP Domiciliary ventilators which entrain room air have been widely used during the pandemic Poor outcomes reported with noninvasive respiratory support using ventilators which lack an oxygen blender could be related to an unreliable Fraction of inspired O 2 FiO 2  Additionally, with concerns about oxygen failure, the variety of ventilator circuits used as well as differing peak inspiratory flow rates PIFR could impact on the FiO 2 delivered during therapy with domiciliary ventilators    Methods  In a series of bench tests, we tested the effect of choice of circuit and different PIFR on the FiO 2 achieved during simulation of ventilation and CPAP therapy using domiciliary ventilators    Results  FiO 2 was highly dependent upon the type of circuit used with circuits with an active exhalation valve achieving similar FiO 2 at lower oxygen flow rates than circuits using an exhalation port During CPAP therapy, high PIFR resulted in significantly lower FiO 2 than low PIFR    Conclusions This study has implications for oxygen usage as well as delivery of noninvasive respiratory support during therapy with domiciliary ventilators when these are used during the second wave of COVID19,,Abstract  Background The importance of ambulatory hypoxia without resting hypoxia in COVID19 is unknown Ambulatory hypoxia without resting hypoxia may help objectively identify highrisk patients hospitalized with COVID19 Interventions may be initiated earlier with sufficient leadtime between development of ambulatory hypoxia and other outcome measures   Methods We performed a retrospective study of adult patients hospitalized with COVID19 from March 1, 2020 to October 30, 2020 in ten hospitals in an integrated academic medical system in the Chicagoland area We analyzed patients who had daily ambulatory oximetry measurements, excluding patients who had first ambulatory oximetry measurements after the use of oxygen therapies nasal cannula or advanced oxygen therapies We determined the association of ambulatory hypoxia without resting hypoxia with the eventual need for nasal cannula or advanced oxygen therapies defined as high flow nasal cannula, BiPAP, ventilator, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation We also calculated the time between development of ambulatory hypoxia and the need for oxygen therapies   Results Of 531 patients included in the study, 132 249 had ambulatory hypoxia Presence of ambulatory hypoxia was strongly associated with subsequent use of nasal cannula OR 48, 95 CI 28  84 and advanced oxygen therapy IRR 77, 95 CI 34  175 Ambulatory hypoxia preceded nasal cannula use by a median 125 hours IQR 325, 2925 and advanced oxygenation therapies by 54 hours IQR 25, 82   Conclusion Ambulatory hypoxia without resting hypoxia may serve as an early, noninvasive physiologic marker for the likelihood of developing moderate to severe COVID19 and help clinicians triage patients and initiate earlier interventions,,,INTRODUCTION Patients with preexisting respiratory diseases in the setting of COVID19 may have a greater risk of severe complications and even death METHODS A retrospective, multicenter, cohort study with 5847 COVID19 patients admitted to hospitals Patients were separated in two groups, withwithout previous lung disease Evaluation of factors associated with survival and secondary composite endpoint such as ICU admission and respiratory support, were explored RESULTS 1,271 patients 22 had a previous lung disease, mostly COPD Allcause mortality occurred in 376 patients with lung disease 295 and in 819 patients without 179 p0001 KaplanMeier curves showed that patients with lung diseases had a worse 30day survival HR178 95CI 158201 p0001 and COPD had almost 40 mortality Multivariable Cox regression showed that prior lung disease remained a risk factor for mortality HR, 121 95CI 102144 p002 Variables independently associated with allcause mortality risk in patients with lung diseases were oxygen saturation less than 92 on admission HR, 435 95 CI 308615 and elevated Ddimer HR, 184 95 CI 127267 Age younger than 60 years HR 037 95 CI 021065 was associated with decreased risk of death CONCLUSIONS Previous lung disease is a risk factor for mortality in patients with COVID19 Older age, male gender, home oxygen therapy, and respiratory failure on admission were associated with an increased mortality Efforts must be done to identify respiratory patients to set measures to improve their clinical outcomes,Noninvasive continuous positive airway pressure NIVCPAP is effective in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure Building evidence during the COVID19 emergency reported that around 50 of patients in Italy treated with NIVCPAP avoided the need for invasive mechanical ventilation Standard NIVCPAP systems operate at high gas flow rates responsible for noise generation and inadequate humidification Furthermore, openconfiguration systems require a high concentration of oxygen to deliver the desired FiO2  Concerns outlined the risk for aerosolization in the ambient air and the possible pressure drop in hospital supply pipes A new NIVCPAP system is proposed that includes automatic control of patient respiratory parameters The system operates as a closedloop breathing circuit that can be assembled, combining a sleep apnea machine with existing commercially available components Analytical simulation of a breathing patient and simulation with a healthy volunteer at different FiO2 were performed Inspired and expired oxygen fraction and inspired and expired carbon dioxide pressure were recorded at different CPAP levels with different oxygen delivery Among the main findings, we report a a significant up to 30fold reduction in oxygen feeding compared to standard open high flow NIVCPAP systems, to assure the same FiO2 levels, and b a negligible production of the noise generated in ventilatory systems, and consequent minimization of patients discomfort The proposed NIVCPAP circuit, reshaped in closedloop configuration with the blower outside of the circuit, has the advantages of minimizing aerosol generation, environmental contamination, oxygen consumption, and noise to the patient The system is easily adaptable and can be implemented using standard CPAP components,,Coronavirus disease 2019 poses a serious threat to public health The protocol developed at the Azienda Sanitaria Universitaria Friuli Centrale Italy is based on clinical data, laboratory tests, chest echography and HRCT Several therapeutic options are considered, since patients vary in disease severity, evolution and comorbidities and because so far there are no clear indications about therapeutic strategy based on randomized clinical trial In this protocol chest echography has a central role in categorizing patient status, followup and decisionmaking,OBJECTIVE Severe asthma is considered a risk factor for SARSCoronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 infection but scientific evidences are lacking METHODS we performed a literature search and review based on PubMed database national, international recommendations as well as papers on severe asthmatic patients and their management during SARSCoV2 pandemic RESULTS the majority of international recommendations, expert panels and editorials provide indications about management of severe asthmatic patients No published studies evaluated the effects of biologic agents on severe asthmatic patients during SARSCoV2 pandemic CONCLUSIONS the relationship between SARSCoV2 and asthma is variable worldwide and severe asthmatic patients were seldom reported in published cohorts International recommendations suggest maintaining asthma under control to limit exacerbations occurrence, by using all available treatment The minimum steroid dosage effective to control symptoms should be maintained to avoid exacerbations biologic agents administration should be regularly scheduled encouraging patient support programmes,Acute myocardial infarction is necrosis of any myocardial mass due to ischemia COVID19 can be complicated by thrombosis and myocardial damage, which can lead to the deployment of a clinical picture similar to acute myocardial infarction The material of this article is presented on the example of a clinical case A woman aged 37 was diagnosed with an acute myocardial infarction, which later turned out to be a manifestation of a complicated course of coronavirus COVID19 infection This case drew attention to the absence of a clinical picture specific to this infection in the form of a damage to the respiratory system or intoxication The case is also distinguished by the presence of a single uncharacteristic clinical manifestation of COVID19 in the form of a cardiovascular event with elevations of the ST segment on the cardiogram and other objective data and additional research methods characteristic of acute myocardial infarction The work also analyzed the pathogenetic mechanisms of acute myocardial infarction and cardiovascular complications of COVID19, examined the general links of pathogenesis of these two pathological units and analyzed the causes of difficulties in their differential diagnosis In this regard, there are unquestionably complications of differential diagnosis and the prescription of timely correct therapy A deeper understanding of these data may improve the algorithms for diagnosing acute myocardial infarction and cardiovascular complications of COVID19,The Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is caused by the human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 SARSCoV2 virus The most common clinical findings related to COVID19 are fever and cough, with the proportion of patients developing interstitial pneumonia Other symptoms include dyspnea, expectoration, headache, anosmia, ageusia, myalgiaxa0and malaise To date, the diagnostic criteria for COVID19 include nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs Computed tomography CT scans of the thorax showing signs of interstitial pneumonia are important in the management of respiratory disease and in the evaluation of lung involvement In the literature, there are few cases of COVID19 pneumonia diagnosis made using magnetic resonance imaging MRI In our report, we describe a case of accidental detection of findings related to interstitial pneumonia in a patient who underwent abdominal MRI for other clinical reasons A 71yearold woman was referred to our department for an MRI scan of the abdomen as her oncological followup She was asymptomatic at the time of the examination and had passed the triage carried out on all the patients prior to diagnostic tests during the COVID19 pandemic The images acquired in the upper abdomen showed the presence of areas of altered signal intensity involving asymmetrically both pulmonary lower lobes, with a patchy appearance and a preferential peripheral subpleural distribution We considered these features as highly suspicious for COVID19 pneumonia The nasopharyngeal swab later confirmed the diagnosis of SARSCoV2 infection There are limited reports about MRI features of COVID19 pneumonia, considering that highresolution chest CT is the imaging technique of choice to diagnose pneumonia Nevertheless, this clinical case confirmed that it is possible to detect MRI signs suggestive of COVID19 pneumonia The imaging features described could help in the evaluation of the lung parenchyma to assess the presence of signs suggestive of COVID19 pneumonia, especially in asymptomatic patients during the pandemic phase of the disease,Hypertension has been identified as a risk factor for coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 and associated adverse outcomes This study examined the association between preinfection blood pressure BP control and COVID19 outcomes using data from 460 general practices in England Eligible patients were adults with hypertension who were tested or diagnosed with COVID19 BP control was defined by the most recent BP reading within 24 months of the index date January 1, 2020 BP was defined as controlled 13080 mmu2009Hg, raised 1308013989 mmu2009Hg, stage 1 uncontrolled 1409015999 mmu2009Hg, or stage 2 uncontrolled 160100 mmu2009Hg The primary outcome was death within 28 days of COVID19 diagnosis Secondary outcomes were COVID19 diagnosis and COVID19related hospital admission Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the association between BP control and outcomes Of the 45u2009418 patients mean age, 67 years 447 male included, 11u2009950 263 had controlled BP These patients were older, had more comorbidities, and had been diagnosed with hypertension for longer A total of 4277 patients 94 were diagnosed with COVID19 and 877 died within 28 days Individuals with stage 1 uncontrolled BP had lower odds of COVID19 death odds ratio, 076 95 CI, 062092 compared with patients with wellcontrolled BP There was no association between BP control and COVID19 diagnosis or hospitalization These findings suggest BP control may be associated with worse COVID19 outcomes, possibly due to these patients having more advanced atherosclerosis and target organ damage Such patients may need to consider adhering to stricter social distancing, to limit the impact of COVID19 as future waves of the pandemic occur,OBJECTIVE As the specialty of cardiothoracic surgery turns the corner into its second century of existence, there has been an uptick in the number of women and underrepresented minorities entering the field, but we have a long way to go before race and gender equity prevails METHODS In this report, specific barriers to diversity without exclusion and mechanisms to breakdown these barriers will be explored RESULTS Barriers to inclusion include a longstanding deficiency in exposure, encouragement, mentorship, and sponsorship to actively attract underrepresented groups to the specialty Diversity will not occur passively It will take a concerted effort best employed through a topdown approach at the local and national level, and it has to seem normal CONCLUSIONS Cardiothoracic surgery is an outstanding field for anyone and everyone who seeks a challenging, rewarding career, regardless of their gender, race, or ethnic background It is the responsibility of leadership to dispel the tradition that certain individuals are not welcome,BackgroundTo evaluate the switching of patients mechanically ventilated on Pressure Support or Volume Control to inverseratio Airway Pressure Release Ventilation APRV during the COVID19 pandemicMethodsWe performed a singlecenter retrospective observational analysis in two ICUs in a tertiary referral university teaching hospital in France Were included patients with Covid19 pneumonia requiring invasive ventilation with a PaO2FiO2 ratio lower than 200 mmHg who performed a 6hour trial of inverseratio APRVResultsSeventeen consecutive patients who completed a 6hour APRV trial in April 2020 were included Three patients who were unable to be maintained on APRV due to an immediate fall in SpO2 were not included In 1217 patients 71, the increase in PaO2FiO2 ratio was greater than 20 Mean  standard deviation PaO2FiO2 ratio increased from 126  28 mmHg to 178  53 mmHg after 6 hours of APRV p0001 Two patients presented a decrease in PaO2FiO2 ratio after 6 hours of APRV There was no appearance of significant hemodynamic impairment during APRV and an eventual increase in PaCO2 during the first hour of APRV was managed by increasing the respiratory rate ie shortening Thigh andor increasing tidal volume ie increasing TlowConclusionsSwitching from Conventional Ventilation Pressure Support or Volume Assist Control to inverseratio APRV for a 6hour period in two ICUs that were not previously familiar with this ventilation technique was well tolerated, and associated with a marked improvement in oxygenation Further studies evaluating inverseratio APRV in acute respiratory failure are warrantedTrial registrationNCT04386369,One of the formidable complications of SARSCOV2 infection leading to death is coagulopathy The mechanisms of the development of this pathology at the present stage have not been studied, and clinical blood tests indicate that against the background of normal blood clotting indices, only the DdiDdimer protein exceeds the norm many times over The aim of the study was to study and analyze biochemical parameters in patients of Primorsky Region Russia infected with SARSCOV2 against the background of concomitant vascular pathology and the development of DIC syndrome The authors came to the conclusion about the existence of two mechanisms of circulatory disorders in the vessels of the microvasculature, associated with the violation of the integrity of the vascular wall and destruction of erythrocytes Further research is needed to study the mechanisms of SARSCoV2 aggression, leading to thrombotic complications,,,Purpose To investigate relationships between echocardiography results and lung ultrasound score LUS in COVID19 pneumonia patients, and the value of their combined application for evaluating COVID19 pneumonia in diagnosis and treatmentMethods Hospitalized patients underwent lung ultrasound and echocardiography daily Patients with tricuspid regurgitation within 3 days after admission were collected, and the correlations and differences between pulmonary artery pressures and LUS on days 3, 8, and 13 were compared The inner diameter of the pulmonary artery root and the sizes of the atria and ventricles were observedResults Pulmonary artery pressure within 3 days was positively correlated with LUS r  0448, p  0003 r  0738, p  0000 r  0325, p  0036 On day 8 the values of both were higher than the corresponding values on days 3 and 13 p  001 On day 8 the positive rate for increased pulmonary artery pressure was 9293942, the positive rate for increased LUS was 9053842, and the combined positive rate for the two was 9764142 On day 8 the inner diameters of the right atrium, right ventricle, and pulmonary artery differed significantly from the corresponding values on days 3 and 13 p  005Conclusions Pulmonary arterial pressure is positively correlated with LUS The two should be combined for more informative assessment of the status of recovery from COVID19 pneumonia,Acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS and respiratory failure are characterized by hypoxemia, ie, low levels of blood oxygen Infections such as influenza and COVID19 can lead to ARDS or respiratory failure Treatment is through supportive measures In severe cases, patients receive oxygen through a ventilator and, when appropriate, are placed in a prone position for an extended period A retrospective review of events submitted to the Pennsylvania Patient Safety Reporting System PAPSRS identified 98 prone positionrelated events in patients with ARDS, respiratory failure, distress, and pneumonia from January 1, 2010, through June 30, 2020 30 events were associated with COVID19 Skin integrity injuries accounted for 837 82 of 98 of the events The remaining events, 163 16 of 98, involved unplanned extubations, cardiac arrests, displaced lines, enteral feedings, medication errors, a dental issue, and posterior ischemic optic neuropathy,,Background During the COVID19 pandemic, people have been required to follow preventive measures such as social distancing or staying at home, which can lead to an unhealthy lifestyle We investigated the effect of these preventive measures on metabolic parameters in individuals with cardiometabolic risk factorsMethods Using data for patients who visited a tertiary hospital in South Korea at least twice a year for the past 4 years, changes in clinical and biochemical data from the COVID19 pandemic 20192020 were compared with changes in the same data at the same annual time points during the three previous seasons of 20162019Results Among 7,094 patients, data for 1,485 were included Systolic blood pressure increased by 26  182 mmHg in the COVID19 pandemic period compared with the 20182019, 20172018, and 20162017 seasons 14  165 mmHg, 28  143 mmHg, and 07  143 mmHg, respectively all p  005 The body mass index increased by 009  116 kgm2 in the 20192020 pandemic season whereas it changed by 039  303 kgm2 in 20182019 and by 034  218 kgm2 in 20172018 both p 005 Total cholesterol, triglycerides, highdensity lipoproteincholesterol, and lowdensity lipoproteincholesterol levels worsened in the pandemic season compared with the previous three Fasting glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels also showed increasing tendencies during the pandemic, but without significance During the COVID19 pandemic, the number of patients whose metabolic syndrome worsened increased significantly by 21 compared with the 20182019 season The 10year coronary heart disease risk calculated using the Framingham risk score also increased significantlyConclusions Comorbidity and mortality arising from cardiometabolic disorders as collateral damage during COVID19 infections and preventive procedures could have major impacts on human health in the future Nationwide strategies to reverse the aggravation of cardiometabolic health during a pandemic should be implemented in countries attempting to cope with it,Distal thrombectomy may be considered in selected patients harboring acute occlusion of distal arterial branches, supplying very eloquent brain areas In these cases navigation and deployment in tortuous, fragile and very smallcaliber arteries is usually involved, potentially increasing the risk of perprocedural vessel wall perforation We report a case of distal recanalization in a righthanded, fourtyyearold woman with left M3 occlusion, with the use of a novel device with manually adapted, gradual expansion, navigated through a 0013inch microcatheter, called the Tigertriever13 RapidMedical, Yokneam, Israel The device was deployed and retrieved with minimal alterationstraightening of the M3 vessels and complete recanalization was achieved The patient achieved NIHSS 0 in less than 24u202fh,Disease due to pulmonary Aspergillus infection remains a significant unmet need, particularly in immunocompromised patients, patients in critical care and those with underlying chronic lung diseases To date, treatment using inhaled antifungal agents has been limited to repurposing available systemic medicines PC945 is a novel triazole antifungal agent, a potent inhibitor of CYP51, purposedesigned to be administered via inhalation for high local lung concentrations and limited systemic exposure In preclinical testing, PC945 is potent versus Aspergillus spp and Candida spp and showed two remarkable properties in preclinical studies, in vitro and in vivo The antifungal effects against Aspergillus fumigatus accumulate on repeat dosing and improved efficacy has been demonstrated when PC945 is dosed in combination with systemic antifungal agents of multiple classes Resistance to PC945 has been induced in Aspergillus fumigatus in vitro, resulting in a strain which remained susceptible to other antifungal triazoles In healthy volunteers and asthmatics, nebulised PC945 was well tolerated, with limited systemic exposure and an apparently long lung residency time In two lung transplant patients, PC945 treated an invasive pulmonary Aspergillus infection that had been unresponsive to multiple antifungal agents systemic  inhaled without systemic side effects or detected drugdrug interactions,Background Understanding the most relevant hematologicalbiochemical characteristics, preexisting health conditions and complications among survivors and nonsurvivor will help to predict the mortality in COVID19 patientsMethods A literature review was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and various preprint servers bioRxiv, medRxiv and SSRN for COVID19 mortality, with more than 97 reported clinical studies and preprints, consisting of survivor and nonsurvivor subpopulations A total of 19014 patients including 14359 survivors and 4655 nonsurvivors were included in this metaanalysis Outcome data was extracted and compared between survivors and nonsurvivors Meta and network analyses were performed using METAMAR V270 and PAST softwareResults The finding showed higher concentrations of gammaglutamyl transferase and creatinine and a higher number of neutrophils in nonsurvivors of COVID19 A lower number of lymphocytes and platelets and a lower concentration of hemoglobin and albumin were observed in nonsurvivors Data showed age, hypertension, and cerebrovascular disease as the most influential risk factors in nonsurvivors Heart failure was the most common complication among nonsurvivors, accompanied by septic shock, and respiratory failureConclusions Increased number of neutrophils and decreased number of platelets and lymphocytes, along with higher GGT concentration and lower hemoglobin levels were the best mortality indicators for COVID19 patients In addition, age, hypertension, and cerebrovascular disease were prevalent riskxa0factorsxa0among nonsurvivors of COVID19 Heart failure and septic shock were the most common complications among nonsurvivors Data indicated that cheap and quick biochemical and hematological tests can be used to predict the risk of mortality in COVID19 patients,,,Background In the context of the current coronavirus pandemic, we propose an inexpensive, innovative overhead transparent plastic barrier with powered suction OTPBPS technique using materials that are ubiquitous in the hospital, easy to set up in minutes and well tolerated by the patients As presented in this case report, it is an effective method to reduce viral spread from patients with positive or suspected yet unconfirmed coronavirus disease 2019 status Case Description A 49yearold male was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of cervical stenosis and a C6C7 disc herniation with spinal cord compression The OTPBPS technique was set up to create a negative pressure environment around the patients head, using a Mayo stand, a transparent plastic bag, and powered wall canister suction The neurosurgeon successfully performed an anterior cervical discectomy and instrumented fusion under OTPBPS The patient was satisfied with the intubation and anesthetic management and reported excellent feedback Conclusion The OTPBPS technique helps control the spread of an aerosolized viral load from the patients mouth or airway during awake fiberoptic intubation This technique will help anesthesiologists and other frontline healthcare providers manage copious endotracheal secretions and droplet particles, which have an immense infectious potential,Background The COVID19 global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, warranted attention for whether it has unique manifestations in children Children tend to develop less severe disease with a small percentage present with clinical manifestations of paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome and have poor prognosis We studied the characteristics of COVID19 in children requiring hospitalisation in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and assessed the clinical presentation and the risk factors for mortality, morbidity, and paediatric intensive care PICU admission Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of COVID19 patients under 15 years hospitalised at three tertiary academic hospitals between 1 March and 30 June 2020 Results Eightyeight children were enrolled 20 were infants Seven 8 were in critical condition and required PICU admission, and 4 45 died of which 3 met the full diagnostic criteria of multisystem inflammatory syndrome and had a high Paediatric Risk of Mortality PRISM score at the time of admission The initial polymerase chain reaction PCR test result was positive for COVID19 in most patients 977, and the remaining two patients had positive result in the repeated confirmatory test In a subset of patients 20 subjects, repeated PCR testing was performed until conversion to negative result, and the average duration for conversion was 8 95 CI 52  105 days Children requiring PICU admission presented with signs of respiratory distress, dehydration, and heart failure Most had fever 714 and tonsillitis 614 were discharged within 7 days of hospitalisation Risk factors for mortality included skin rash, hypotension, hypoxia, signs of heart failure, chest radiograph suggestive of acute respiratory distress syndrome, anaemia, leucocytosis, hypernatraemia, abnormal liver enzymes, and high troponin I, and risk factors for prolonged hospitalisation 7 days included the presence of comorbidities, leucopaenia, hyponatraemia, and elevated Creactive protein Conclusions The majority of hospitalised children had a brief febrile illness and made a full recovery, but a minority had severe disease,Increasingly, quantitative lung computed tomography qCTderived metrics are providing novel insights into chronic inflammatory lung diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, interstitial lung disease, and more Metrics related to parenchymal, airway, and vascular anatomy together with various measures associated with lung function including regional parenchymal mechanics, air trapping associated with functional small airways disease, and dualenergy derived measures of perfused blood volume are offering the ability to characterize disease phenotypes associated with the chronic inflammatory pulmonary diseases With the emergence of COVID19, together with its widely varying degrees of severity, its rapid progression in some cases, and the potential for lengthy postCOVID19 morbidity, there is a new role in applying wellestablished qCTbased metrics Based on the utility of qCT tools in other lung diseases, previously validated supervised classical machine learning methods, and emerging unsupervised machine learning and deeplearning approaches, we are now able to provide desperately needed insight into the acute and the chronic phases of this inflammatory lung disease The potential areas in which qCT imaging can be beneficial include improved accuracy of diagnosis, identification of clinically distinct phenotypes, improvement of disease prognosis, stratification of care, and early objective evaluation of intervention response There is also a potential role for qCT in evaluating an increasing population of postCOVID19 lung parenchymal changes such as fibrosis In this work, we discuss the basis of various lung qCT methods, using caseexamples to highlight their potential application as a tool for the exploration and characterization of COVID19, and offer scanning protocols to serve as templates for imaging the lung such that these established qCT analyses have the best chance at yielding the much needed new insights,A 42yearold man with COVID19 pneumonia was admitted to a small town hospital that did not have Intensive CareICU level of resources availableTwelve hours later, the patient suddenly became agitated, and an extensive anterolateral STelevation myocardial infarction was detected by 12lead EKG and supported by a rise in serum cardiac enzymesLow blood oxygen saturation59 and cardiac ejection fractionEF20 reflected criticality that could potentially require cath lab, CABG surgery, and ICU level of resourcesFollowing coordination of physicians with the nearest equipped hospital and aeromedical crewAMC, a Mil Mi17 medical helicopter unit was dispatchedAbout 20 minutes before reaching the destination hospital, his clinical condition declined, as HR50beatsmin, BP7540mmHg and jugular veins distentionMuffled heart sounds, decreased voltage in EKG and accumulation of pericardial effusion via bedside Ultrasound indicated cardiac tamponadeAMC resuscitated the patient through the interventions of intubation, mechanical ventilation, administration of intravenous fluids, and initiation of an Epinephrine infusionUltrasoundguided pericardiocentesis was performed in the helicopter which kept him alive until pericardotomy could be performed at the destination hospitalUnfortunately, after pericardiotomy and CABG surgery, the patient died 7 days later in the ICU due to severe cardiopulmonary failure,,,,,,,,Background COVID19 outbreak and lockdown is a situation associating social and physical isolation, limited care access, psychological stress, and potential adoption of unhealthy lifestyle behaviours such as smoking In a cohort of outpatients with chronic cardiac diseases, including congestive heart failure CHF and chronic coronary syndromes CCS, we aimed to evaluate the impact of Covid19 outbreak on tobacco consumption Patients and methods During the 6th week of lockdown which had started on March, 17th, 150 randomly selected CHF patients from the Dijon HFClinic and 250 CCSxa0patients from the RICO survey were invited to answer an anonymous questionnaire The 20min lasting phone interview was conducted by 8 trained research assistants The questionnaire, which was validated through internal and external control procedures, addressed medical, lifestyle topics and psychological distress through Kessler 6 score K6 5 Results Among the 400 patients, 325 were responders 812, including 201 CCS and 124 CHF Among the current smokers n 43, 13 303 declared increased tobacco consumption, including one woman who started smoking during the lockdown and one man who relapsed after quitting The main reported explanations for increased smoking was stress 7 and inactivity 5 none declared the influence of media messages on a potential protective effect of nicotine as a cause of increase Main results are summarized in Table 1 Conclusion During COVID19 lockdown, a significant rate of cardiac patients has increased their tobacco consumption, which is often associated with psychological distress and other deleterious lifestyle behaviours, in particular in men These alarming findings may have major implications for disease destabilization and event recurrence in such highrisk patients at both short and long term This may help toxa0define preventive strategies to targetxa0after lockdown relief in chronic cardiac populations,,Extracorporeal life support ECLS is an essential component of a modern congenital cardiac surgery program The circuit components and bedside management team may, however, vary among institutions Here, we evaluate our initial experience with a modified ventricular assist devicebased ECLS circuit primarily managed by the bedside nurse We hypothesize that our outcomes are comparable to Extracorporeal Life Support Organization ELSO registry data All patients who received ECLS from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019 at a single institution were included Primary outcomes were survival to ECLS decannulation and discharge or transfer Secondary outcomes included complications from ECLS Data were compared to available ELSO registry data Thirtyseven patients underwent 44 ECLS runs during the study period Forty percent of patients had single ventricle physiology Nearly 46 of patients received ECLS as part of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation eCPR Survival to ECLS decannulation 682 and survival to discharge or transfer 614 did not differ from overall ELSO outcomes 697, Pxa0 870 and 507, Pxa0 136, as well as survival to discharge or transfer in a comparable cohort of ELSO centers 531, Pxa0 081 Patients with complications had a lower rate of survival to discharge or transfer but this did not reach statistical significance 477 vs 750, Pxa0 455 Neurologic 500, hemorrhagic 455, and renal complications 318 were most common in this cohort A modified ventricular assist devicebased ECLS circuit with primary management by the bedside nurse can provide comparable support in a neonatal and pediatric cardiac surgery population Cost analyses and further delineation of the complication profile are necessary for a complete characterization of this system,Kawasaki disease KD is an acute vasculitis of unknown etiology that frequently occur in childhood and young children and may lead to coronary arteries aneurysm CAA Treatment can lower the risk of development of giant aneurysm and is based on the administration of IGIV, aspirin and may need some adjunctive therapies Methods In a retrospective study ruled between January 2014 and December 2018, we enrolled 49 children who were diagnosed with complete or incomplete Kawasaki disease in the internalmedicine pediatrics service of Ibn Rochd Hospital Results 49 cases of Kawasaki disease were included, of which 592xa0 of boys and 408 of girls Mean age was 3139 months 23 cases were diagnosed with complete KD Oral cavity changes were present in 898 of all patients Bilateral nonexudative conjonctival injection were found in 877 of cases 439 of children had cervical lymphadenopathy, while 714 of them presented a polymorphous rash Erythema of the extremities was found in 571 of cases Inflammatory blood test revealed a mean value of 7280mm for vs and 1413mgL for CRP All the patients underwent echocardiography at admission, revealing 285 of coronary arteries dilatation and 6 of coronary artery aneurysm 46 patients received a single dose of IGIV and antiinflammatory dose of aspirin with good evolution 3 patients received a secondary dose of IGIV, and one of them required administration of anakinra 72h was the average time for defervescence The vs was positively correlated to coronary artery abnormalities in our series with a p value of 0022 Control echocardiography was ruled out 6 weeks after admission, and revealed that 375 of coronary artery abnormalities disappeared, 435 regressed, 65remained stable and 125 developed giant aneurysms Conclusion Despite KD remains a poorly understood pathology, a rapid treatment and follow up can improve the prognosis and lower associated complications,,,,,,,Background In the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic, rapid clinical triage is crucial to determine which patients need hospitalisation We hypothesised that chest computed tomography CT and alveolararterial oxygen tension ratio Aa gradient may be useful to triage these patients, since they reflect the severity of the pneumoniaassociated ventilationperfusion abnormalities   Methods A retrospective analysis was performed in 235 consecutive patients suspected for COVID19 The diagnostic protocol included lowdose chest CT and arterial blood gas analysis In patients with CTbased COVID19 pneumonia, the association between need for hospitalisation and Aa gradient was investigated by a multivariable logistic regression model The Aa gradient was tested as a predictor for need for hospitalisation using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and a logistic regression model   Results  72 out of 235 patients mean sd age 555146 years, 40 female screened by chest CT showed evidence for COVID19 pneumonia In these patients, Aa gradient was shown to be a predictor of need for hospitalisation, with an optimal decision level cutoff of 364 mmHg 95 CI 070091, p0001 The Aa gradient was shown to be independently associated with need for hospitalisation OR 197 95 CI 123315, p0005 Aa gradient per 10 points from CT severity score OR 113 95 CI 094136, p0191, National Early Warning Score OR 119 95 CI 091157, p0321 or peripheral oxygen saturation OR 088 95 CI 068114, p0345    Conclusion Lowdose chest CT and the Aa gradient may serve as rapid and accurate tools to diagnose COVID19 pneumonia and to select mildly symptomatic patients in need for hospitalisation,Background Main features of COVID19 patients have been reported in the literature While young patients under 45 years old yo account for a nonnegligible part of hospitalized patients, data on this population remain sparse Purpose To describe the characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized COVID19 young patients 45 yo Methods The Critical COVID France CCF study was an observational multicenter study including patients hospitalized for COVID19 Primary composite outcome included transfer to ICU or inhospital death Secondary outcomes were cardiovascular complications diagnosed by the referring medical team according to available clinical, biological and radiological findings Results Among 2,878 patients hospitalized for COVID19 in 24 centers, 321 112 patients were under the age of 45 yo They had a higher body mass index BMI 28966 vs 27760, P 0004 but less other cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension 29 92 vs 1422 561, P 0001, diabetes 20 63 vs 656 259, P 0001 and dyslipidemia 15 47 vs 783 307, P 0001 The primary outcome occurred in 54 168 patients under 45 yo vs 783 307 in patients aged 45 yo P 0001, with a strong impact on the death rate 3 09 vs 358 140, P 0001 The group under 45 yo experienced more frequently related COVID19 cardiovascular complications such as pericarditis 12 05 vs 7 22, P 0003 and myocarditis 14 06 vs 8 25, P 0002 Conversely, acute heart failure occurred more frequently in patients aged 45 yo 183 72 vs 3 09, P 0001 Acute coronary syndrome and stroke were similar between the two groups Fig 1 Conclusion In this nationwide multicenter observational study of hospitalized COVID19 patients, patients under the age of 45 yo had less cardiovascular risk factors but more specific related COVID19 cardiovascular complications such as pericarditis and myocarditis,Background COVID19 interacts at multiple levels with the cardiovascular system The prognosis of COVID19 infection is known to be worse for patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases Furthermore, the virus is responsible for many cardiovascular complications Myocardial injury may affect up to 20 of critically ill patients However, echocardiographys impact on the management of patients affected by COVID19 remains unknown Objectives To explore echocardiographys impact on the management of COVID19 patients Methods This study was conducted from March 24th to April 14th 2020, in a single centre at AdolphedeRothschild Foundation Hospital, Paris, France All consecutive inpatients with laboratory andor CT COVID19 diagnosis were included in this study Patients characteristics clinical, biological and imaging and treatment change induced by echocardiography were collected and analysed Patients with and without treatment change induced by echocardiography were compared Results A total of 56 echocardiographies in 42 patients with highly suspected or confirmed COVID19 were included in the final analyses The median age was 66 IQR 60574 Echocardiography induced a treatment change in 9 cases 16 The analysed clinical data were not associated with any treatment change induced by echocardiography Ddimer and troponin levels were the only biological predictors of induced treatment change On echocardiography, higher systolic pulmonary arterial pressures and documented cardiac thrombi were associated with treatment changes in these patients Conclusions Echocardiography may be useful for the management of selected COVID19 patients, especially those with elevated DDimer and troponin levels, in up to 16 of patients,Aims We aimed to investigate whether micronet on stent could preserve the index of msicrocirculatory resistance IMR after primary percutaneous coronary intervention PCI in patients with acutemyocardial infarction AMI Methods and results Fifty deux patients with AMI were randomized into two groups primary PCI with micronet on stent MGUARD group, n 25 and primary PCI with any commercially available DES group, n 27 As the primary endpoint, IMR was measured immediately after primary PCI using a pressuretemperature sensortipped coronary wire The secondary endpoint was the left ventricular ejection fraction LVEF at sixmonth followup The IMR in MGUARD group was significantly lower than in DES group 396262 U vs 754605 U, P 001 No significant differences in baseline EF 562103 vs 549773, P 07, however, there were significant differences in followup EF 63238 vs 547779, P 0001 Conclusion A micronet on stent significantly improved CMVD compared with a traditional DES in primary PCI and appear as a useful technological option to manage the thrombus,,,,Biological lung volume reduction BioLVR is a novel and lowcost endobronchial treatment method aimed at reducing the volume of the target lung lobe using biological agents, including fibrinbased hydrogel, fibrinogen, and autologous blood AB with thrombin BioLVR induces local inflammation, resulting in acute airway obstruction, resorption atelectasis, fibrosis, and finally tissue remodeling by contraction of the target lobe and reduction in the lung volume, similar to the application of hot water vapor and foam In addition, patients with severe impairment in lung function and quality of life may refuses to undergo surgery, resulting in limited treatment options In such complex clinical scenarios, BioLVR with AB appears to be a good therapeutic option These treatment modalities resulted in favorable outcomes in patients with heterogeneous and bullous emphysema, pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and giant bullous lesions AB applications result in functional improvement, improvement in the quality of life, decrease in dyspnea scores, and reduction in the size of bullae Based on the available evidence, application of AB for lung volume reduction is minimally invasive and well tolerated by patients There was no incidence of pneumothorax or mortality This review aimed to investigate the benefits, complications, and future perspectives of AB application as BioLVR in the treatment of hyperinflated lung diseases,OBJECTIVE Obesity is considered a major risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome OSAS This study aimed to examine the correlation between anthropometric measurements, which have been recently defined and are indicative of abdominal obesity and cardiometabolic diseases, OSAS severity, and polysomnography PSG parameters in patients with OSAS MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective cohort study included patients who underwent allnight polysomnography with a prediagnosis of OSAS These patients were categorized as having mild 515, moderate 1530, and severe 30 OSAS according to the apneahypopnea index AHI The anthropometric measurements used in the study consisted of waisttohip ratio WHR, waisttoheight ratio WHtR, waisthiptoheight ratio WHHR, a body shape index ABSI, body adiposity index BAI, abdominal volume index AVI, and conicity index CI RESULTS A total of 410 individuals were enrolled in the study 31 control subjects and 129 with mild, 101 with moderate, and 149 with severe OSAS A significant difference was observed between groups in terms of all anthropometric measurements p005 The difference between the groups was significant in terms of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease p005 There was a significant correlation between each of the anthropometric measurements and the PSG parameters In the receiver operating characteristic analysis, cutoff values that predicted severe OSAS were ABSI008, BAI2829, AVI2554, and CI137 Multiple regression analyses demonstrated that age, sex, and AVI were independent predictors that determine OSAS presence CONCLUSION Anthropometric parameters that are indicators of abdominal obesity were found to be robustly correlated with cardiometabolic diseases and the severity of OSAS,Modulation of human lung airway physiology by commensal microbiota has become one of the key mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of adult asthma Recent evidence suggests that the composition of respiratory microbiota plays a significant role in the manifestation of adult asthma however, scientific evidence about the relationship between airway microbial diversity and phenotypes of adult asthma is limited Further research is needed to understand the interactions between the airway microbiota and host immune response to develop microbiotabased strategies in management of adult asthma This study reviews the advances in cultureindependent methods for detection of airway microbiome, the current data about airway microbiota in healthy individuals and in adult patients with asthma with a focus on bacterial communities, and the future research directions in airway microbiome,OBJECTIVE Thoracic epidural analgesia TEA reduces pulmonary complications after thoracotomy Hypothetically, this advantage is partially because of the preserved pulmonary function, which is achieved by the reduction of postoperative pain and immobility This study aimed to compare the principal methods of analgesia through early postoperative spirometric performance and gas exchange parameters after elective lung cancer surgery TEA or intravenous analgesia IVA involving pethidine was used as the principal method in our sample population MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 62 patients operated via the posterolateral thoracotomy approach were enrolled Postoperative analgesia was secured using multimodal analgesia with either TEA with 01 bupivacaine or IVA Pain perception was assessed with the visual analog scale VAS while at rest and on coughing Arterial blood samples were collected at 1, 24, and 72 hours postoperatively Preoperative and third postoperative day spirometric measurements were recorded RESULTS There were no significant differences among the groups in terms of demographic characteristics, properties of surgical technique, and diseaseassociated conditions VAS scores of the TEA group were lower at the 72hour followup, but a considerable fraction of these differences did not reach statistical significance Reduction in the forced expiratory volume in the first second and forced vital capacities was more prominent in the IVA group on the third postoperative day, but these were not statistically significant either Oxygenation parameters favored TEA but remained comparable Finally, the pH values were significantly lower in the IVA group at 1 and 72 hours postoperatively p0008 and p002, respectively CONCLUSION We believe that TEA is advantageous over IVA with alteration of respiratory volumes during the early postoperative period,Background Up to 50 of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD patients do not receive recommended care for COPD To address this issue, we developed Proactive Integrated Care Proactive iCare, a health care delivery model that couples integrated care with remote monitoring Methods We conducted a prospective, quasirandomized clinical trial in 511 patients with advanced COPD or a recent COPD exacerbation, to test whether Proactive iCare impacts patientcentered outcomes and health care utilization Patients were allocated to Proactive iCare n352 or Usual Care  159 and were examined for changes in quality of life using the St Georges Respiratory Questionnaire SGRQ, symptoms, guidelinebased care, and health care utilization Findings Proactive iCare improved total SGRQ by 79 units p  00001, symptom SGRQ by 9 units p00001, activity SGRQ by 67 units p0001 and impact SGRQ by 711 units p00001 at 3, 6 and 9 months compared with Usual Care Proactive iCare increased the 6minute walk distance by 40 m p0001, reduced annual COPDrelated urgent office visits by 76 visits per 100 participants p00001, identified unreported exacerbations, and decreased smoking p001 Proactive iCare also improved symptoms, the body mass indexairway obstructiondyspneaexercise tolerance BODE index and oxygen titration p005 Mortality in the Proactive iCare group 11 was not significantly different than mortality in the Usual Care group 38 p008 Interpretation Linking integrated care with remote monitoring improves the lives of people with advanced COPD, findings that may have been made more relevant by the coronavirus 2019 COVID19 pandemic,Malignant hypertension MHT still exists, leading young people to a poor prognosis Yet, we lack clear guidelines, mainly because data are scarce We initiated the first MHT multicentric network to assess these issues We built a 28 centers network so far, aiming for 4050 French centers end 2020, and European participation in 2021 We prospectively recruit patients with severe hypertension 180110 and severe hypertensive retinopathy common definition or 3target organ damage among heart, kidney, brain and thrombotic microangiopathy MOD HTN definition We hope to recruit 500 patients in 5 years, with a 5 years follow up We currently collect clinical and examination data, aiming for building a biobank and a target organ damage corelab to entirely reconsider the disease During the first 6 months, we recruited as planned 58 patients, 41 were male, 49115 years old Half of them were not known hypertensive, and one third presented a secondary hypertension Nonobservance was reported in 25 of patients as a trigger Mean blood pressure was 2192911920mmHg Patient care pathway was very different according to initial symptoms, target organ damage and centers hypertension, neurology, nephrology, cardiology, internal medicine, intensive care unit and emergency department Target organ damage was respectively 70, 33, 25 and 25 for kidney, heart, brain and thrombotic microangiopathy, mostly improving during follow up Most of patients 70 benefited from intravenous antihypertensive treatment and saline infusion Length of stay was on average 8 days Malignant Hypertension clearly didnt disappear, but was diluted between the different specialities and forgotten This most severe presentation has to be considered once again to better manage our patients The unique HAMA network should make it possible to gather highquality data to improve our knowledge and rediscover the disease,,Background Sawtooth Cardiomyopathy is a very rare disease, that should not be confused with left ventricular non compaction, and only few cases have been described Methods and results We describe the case of a 33yearold man who presented with atypical chest pain The ECG showed left posterior fascicular block Left ventricular noncompaction LVNC was initially suspected by echocardiography Cardiac MRI found no criteria for LVNC but typical protrusions of muscular bridges in the left ventricle with dense compacted myocardium leading to the diagnosis of SawTooth Cardiomyopathy No arrhythmic event nor heart failure were noticed In the family there was no cardiac history nor sudden death We performed genetic analysis by sequencing a large panel of 71 genes associated with cardiomyopathies Roche Nimblegen capture probes, sequencing on Miseq Illumina No pathogenic variant was found according to ACMG criteria Fig 1 Conclusion Less than ten cases of SawTooth Cardiomyopathy STCMP were previously reported in literature and STCMP was initially reported as a variant of LVNC In fact, myocardial features of STCMP are very different from LVNC and STCMP should be considered as a separate entity Some cases were discovered during infancy suggesting prenatal development Our case first illustrates this distinct entity since none of LVNC criteria were met but typical Sawtooth muscular bridges that were better exhibited on MRI Second, our case is the first to report on genetic testing and familial investigations We did not observed other cardiomyopathy in the family and we did not identify any pathogenic mutation in known cardiomyopathy genes Although we cannot exclude a nongenetic cause, this result may suggest a genetic cause outside the genes usually related to cardiomyopathies and suggest the search for a new gene through exome or genome sequencing,En este artículo se muestran las publicaciones que hemos considerado más relevantes sobre cardiopatías congénitas en el último año La pandemia de COVID19ha marcado este periodo e implica un gran desafío en el

fetal y tratamiento de arritmias que serán de gran utilidad en la estandarización del tratamiento de estos pacientes complejos Queremos destacar los trabajos relacionados con la estratificación de riesgo de muerte súbita y el tratamiento de la insuficiencia cardiaca avanzada, y en el caso de los pacientes pediátricos, cómo los avances en el manejo de los posibles donantes están consiguiendo reducir la siempre larga lista de espera para el trasplante cardiaco pediátrico Por último, el intervencionismo percutáneo a cualquier edad y las técnicas quirúrgicas, con especial interés en las técnicas de reconstrucción valvular aórtica en niños y jóvenes, siguen avanzando y explorando caminos hasta ahora insospechados This paper shows a selection of the most relevant articles in congenital heart diseases published since the end of the last year The COVID19 pandemic represents a significant challenge for the care of patients with congenital heart diseases Multiple guidelines and consensus have been published pulmonary hypertension, multimodality imaging during followup, ultrasound examination of the fetal heart and management of arrhythmias and will be very useful for the standardization of the management of these complex patients We highlight contributions related to risk stratification for sudden cardiac death and advanced heart failure therapies for patients with congenital heart disease In this regard, the long waiting lists for pediatric heart transplantation are being reduced due to the progress in the management of potential donors Finally, percutaneous interventions at any age and surgical techniques, with a particular focus on aortic valve leaflet reconstruction techniques in children and young adults, continue to develop and explore new paths previously unexpected,,,,Background Telemonitoring of heart failure in entering step by step into the daily practice especially in France with the ETAPES experimentation Purpose NEWCARD is one of the solutions involved in this experimentation The aim of this retrospective study is to describe the characteristics of the patients followed by NEWCARD, their evolution and how the system was able to improve their medical history Methods The inclusion criterias of the patients are based on the ETAPES experimentation especially hospitalisation for heart failure within 12 months Patients have to be followed as least 2 months and then as long as they want to do so Classical baseline characteristics for heart failure are monitored at the start of the study Everyday were measured at home for every patient weight, heart rate, blood pressure and dyspnea status Those datas were analysed by the system algorithm and alarms were sent and monitored according to the NEWCARD process Events especially death and hospitalisations were monitored by 3 differents sources NEWCARD nurses, patients and their cardiologists We will calculate the predictive values, sensibility and specificity of the ongoing algorithm used routinely We will then do the same retrospectively with the actual algorithm Ultimately, we will use artificial intelligence to improve it Results We will present the results of 465 patients followed from 2 to more than 30 months 30 of them have an ejection fraction of more than 50 almost 45 are 80 years old or more 300,000 datas have been collected Conclusion The aim of this retrospective study is triple 1to evaluate the NEWCARD telemonitoring system after 3 years of implementation 2to use this experience to improve especially the algorithm 3all those results will help to design a prospective study which will start at the end of 2020,,Vascular occlusion has multiple, diverse clinical manifestations, some of which can have grave consequences for patients The causes of vascular occlusion are also highly variable, ranging from thrombi triggered by the uncontrolled activation of coagulation mechanisms, on the one hand, to endothelial dysfunction or occlusion by material extrinsic to the coagulation system on the other In a 2part review, we look at the main causes of vascular occlusion and the key clinical and histopathologic findings In this first part, we focus on vascular occlusion involving thrombi,Introduction Carotidfemoral pulse wave velocity cfPWV is the current gold standard to assess arterial stiffness, a strong predictor of cardiovascular mortality Recently, some studies demonstrated that cfPWV was independently correlated with LDL cholesterol Purpose The aim of this study was to assess the correlation of apolipoprotein B and cfPWV Methods During a complete workup of hypertension, lipids parameters were collected after an overnight fast CfPWV was measured with a Complior device Real travel distance was used 08×direct travel distance to assess PWV as recommended Results Our cohort included 973 hypertensive patients with the following characteristics age 505148 years, 511 of men, blood pressure 150258415mm Hg, body mass index 26848kgm2, 201 of smokers, 142 of diabetes, eGFR 870231mLmin, total cholesterol 5110mmolL, LDL cholesterol 3109mmolL, nonHDL cholesterol 2005mmolL, apolipoprotein B 1003mmolL and cfPWV 8824ms Using a continuous variable cfPWV was correlated with total cholesterol r 0111, P 0001, LDL cholesterol r 0074, P 0021, nonHDL cholesterol r0102, P 0002 and more significantly with apolipoprotein B r 0154, P 0001 In multivariate logistic regression model after adjustment for age, sex, HR, mean BP, fasting glucose, smoking, BMI and lipid lowering therapy, a cfPWV10ms was independently associated with apolipoprotein B Hazard ratio 191, 95 CI 106345 but not with total cholesterol Hazard ratio 114, 95 CI 099132 LDL cholesterol Hazard ratio 114, 95 CI 096134 and nonHDL cholesterol Hazard ratio 124, 95 CI 090171 Conclusion In this cohort of hypertensive patients, apolipoprotein B was the strongest lipid parameters associated with cfPWV It may explain the additive prognostic value of apolipoprotein B on top of other lipid parameters to predict cardiovascular events,,,,,Se incluyen las principales novedades científicas relacionadas con la insuficiencia cardiaca y el trasplante cardiaco, publicadas durante el año 2020 This article describes the main scientific news related to heart failure and heart transplant published in 2020,Background Heart failure HF is associated with a high mortality rate and recurrent hospitalizations Purpose To present the first data of the patients using the innovative solution Satelia Cardio NP MedicalWeHealth™ Digital Medicine Method Satelia Cardio is a HF patient management solution with a remote monitoring system and a therapeutic guidance by dedicated nurse phone platform, supported by ETAPES Program The system is accessible from any devices, requiring no installation, and the use is possible by nonconnected patients After the inclusion, the patient is contacted by the nurse, he then receives an SMS alert on regular basis, with a link leading to a web page to answer 7 questions, and to give his current body weight Satelia algorithm is based on this signs,their variability, and the weight In case of worsening of symptoms, the cardiologist will be notified Results 124 centers 200 cardiologists are using Satelia Cardio with 1832 HF patients monitored in the last 18 months The patients, mean age of 72 years 1997 are predominantly males 69, and mostly NYHA IIIII 6830 The adherence to the system is very good 81 with 86 of patients still monitored N 1569 The main reasons for stopping are related to the occurrence of death 105263 or nonfatal events 71263, or patient decision 87263 Over the period of analysis, the HF patients answered to 46 637 questionnaires, generating 2429 alerts transmitted to the referent cardiologists Since Covid19 lockdown, more than 600 patients have been monitored with the solution Conclusion Patient management solution with a remote monitoring system is key to improving the followup of HF patients The solution Satelia Cardio is an easy way to use a web application to monitor HF patients, accepted by the patients with a low rate of premature discontinuation A further step will be to initiate studies to assess the clinical impact of such remote monitoring solution in HF,,,Background Fulminant myocarditis is a lifethreatening condition characterized by hemodynamic instability leading to cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ECMO could be used in patients refractory to conventional treatment Purpose We aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of fulminant myocarditis patients managed with ECMO at a singlecentre, multidisciplinary experience Methods We performed a retrospective observational analysis of our local database The diagnosis of myocarditis was made from clinical, biologic and imaging criteria according to European guidelines The primary endpoint was survival to hospital discharge Results Of the 577 patients who had ECLS from January 2010 to December 2019, 16 27 were treated for fulminant myocarditis The mean age was 385 years range 2169 years and 687 were female Main symptoms at hospital admission were chest pain N 6, 375, heart failure N 6, 375, syncope N 3, 187 and cardiogenic shock N 1, 62 Seven 437 patients presented a flulike syndrome prior to the first medical contact Complementary diagnostic tools included endomyocardial biopsy N 8, 50 and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging N 7, 437 ECMO was implanted during ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation in 2 125 patients Five 313 patients died during ECMO support while 10 625 were successfully weaned after a mean ECMO support of 93 days One 62 patient was switched to a left ventricular assist device as a bridgetotransplantation Overall survival to hospital discharge was 687 N 11 After the acute phase, most 727 of the survivors displayed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction at hospital discharge Conclusion ECMO offered a satisfactory survival to hospital discharge in these critically ill patients Our results underscore the high potential of myocardial recovery after the acute phase of fulminant myocarditis,En este artículo se revisan las publicaciones y los estudios de mayor relevancia en el ámbito de la cardiología intervencionista en el año 2020 Dentro del intervencionismo coronario, varios estudios han aportado información relevante en cuanto al tratamiento quirúrgico o percutáneo del tronco coronario izquierdo, así como en el abordaje de bifurcaciones consideradas complejas En antiagregación tras síndrome coronario agudo e intervencionismo, hay estudios importantes que supondrán modificaciones de las guías de práctica clínica En angina estable, los datos indican que el manejo inicial conservador puede ser adecuado Finalmente, la fisiología coronaria sigue despertando gran interés en diferentes contextos clínicos y anatómicos En cuanto al intervencionismo estructural, continúa experimentando un importante crecimiento y desarrollo Se ha publicado el primer estudio aleatorizado sobre el tratamiento antitrombótico tras implante de válvula aórtica percutánea, que cambiará nuestra práctica clínica Destacan también los avances y primeros implantes de prótesis percutáneas mitrales y tricúspides y la evidencia en favor del cierre de la orejuela en pacientes de alto riesgo Finalmente, este año ha estado marcado por la pandemia de COVID19 y su repercusión sobre la actividad asistencial e investigadora This article reviews the most relevant studies in the field of interventional cardiology in 2020 In the area of coronary intervention, relevant information with respect to the percutaneous coronary intervention PCI vs coronary artery bypass grafting for the left main treatment has been published, as well as, the best approach in dealing with complex bifurcation lesions There have also been significant studies regarding antiplatelet strategies in patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing PCI, which will potentially change our clinical practice Regarding stable angina, data point out that an initial conservative treatment can be an appropriate strategy Finally, coronary physiology continues to generate a great interest in different clinical and anatomical contexts The advances in the field of intervention for structural heart disease have continued to increase exponentially in the last year The first randomized trial assessing the optimal antithrombotic treatment after transcatheter aortic valve implantation has been published and that will have clinical implications It also highlightes the development and implantation of the first mitral and tricuspid percutaneous prosthesis, as well as, the evidence in favour of left atrial appendage closure in highrisk patients Finally, this year has been marked by the COVID19 pandemic which has had an impact on the clinical and research activities,Introduction Malignant hypertension MHT is a very serious, potentially lethal form of hypertension However, there are currently no specific guidelines for therapeutic management Material and methods Our study based on the MHT prospective cohort of the Bordeaux University Hospital included 74 patients treated in the acute phase of the disease between 2009 and 2019 When no lifethreatening organ damage was observed uncomplicated MHT, patients received an oral titration of Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors ACEI up to twice the fullrecommended dose Our objective was to describe the results of this protocol in terms of feasibility, efficiency and safety Results Of the 74 patients, 66 were men and 15 were of AfroCaribbean origin The patients treated averaged 471 years of age with an entry blood pressure of 219 29125 22 mmHg, an average organ damage of 3209 including brain, eye, heart, hemolysis, and kidneys and 11 of MODHTA The protocol was completed on all 74 patients Saline infusion was used in 34 of patients No serious adverse event such as acute renal failure, hyperkalaemia or hypotension requiring the transfer to an intensive care unit occurred Substantial reduction of blood pressure was observed in 97of patients, and onemonth average blood pressure was 14090mmHg in 84 of patients This remains true in the subgroups of patients with renal failure or renal artery stenosis Conclusion Management of uncomplicated MHT by titration of ACE inhibitors makes it possible to achieve effective blood pressure control with a very good tolerance profile The comparatively low cost of this protocol, its wide availability in developing countries and its focus on MHT pathophysiology cornerstone seem to make it a robust alternative to the IV approach,Backgroundintroduction Multipke lood pressure BP measurements during several visits are recommended for diagnosis of hypertension However, in epidemiological studies, BP is frequently measured during a single visit It has been widely described that the prevalence of hypertension based on BP measurement at a single visit is overestimated because of the regression to the mean phenomenon Purpose The aim of our study was to give an unbiased estimate of the hypertension prevalence in France Methods Esteban was a crosssectional survey implemented in 2015 based on a random sample of the French population Three standardized BP measurments were performed during a clinical exam Hypertension was defined as BP14090mmHg or hypertensive treatment After correcting BP to account for the withinperson variability estimated from other studies with repeated visits, we estimated the prevalence of hypertension and the proportions of treated and controlled hypertensives and the number of hypertensives in France Results The prevalence estimates of hypertension from the Esteban study decreased from 306 using observed data to 226 after correction with the BP variability The proportion of drugtreated hypertensive patients increased from 489 to 678 and the proportion of controlled BP among treated patients from 496 to 521, before and after correction respectively By applying these corrected proportions to the French adult population by sex and age categories, the number of hypertensive patients reached 13,000,000, of which 9,000,000 were treated Conclusion Using estimation of the withinperson variability from other studies, the new prevalence of hypertension in the French adult population would be around 226 13 million people after correction Taking into account BP variability could avoid a substantial overestimation of the prevalence of hypertension at the population level,,Background In the 2019 ESCEAS guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias, coronary artery calcium CAC score assessment may be considered as a risk modifier It seems that CAC score is often very low in patients younger than 45 with severe familial hypercholesterolaemia FH Purpose We assessed the relationship between CAC score and FH Methods Analysis was based on patients consecutively referred to a Department of Preventive Cardiology and having a CAC score assessed n 1402 FH was diagnosed using the modified version of the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network DLCN LDLC was corrected for patients under statin or ezetimibe using dose and statin or ezetimibespecific correction factors FH was considered as definite, probable, possible or unlikely for a total 8, equal to 68, 35 or 3 points, respectively Results DLCN score was assessed in 1157 patients CAC score was significantly associated with DLCN score 21, 29, 18, and 32 of the patients with FH DLCN score for definite or probable FH n 38 versus 39, 29, 18 and 14 of the patients without FH DLCN score for possible or unlikely FH n 1119 had a CAC score equal to 0, 1100, 101400 and 400, respectively P 0009 Factors independently associated with a CAC400 were age, male gender, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, lipidlowering treatment and definite or probable FH Among patients with FH45 years, CAC was0 for 40 of patients Among patients with FH, 11 had premature CVD and 68 were treated Mean corrected LDLC was 98mmolL 23 and 41mmolL 13 in patients with and without FH, respectively P 00001 None of the patients with FH reached the LDLC goal In patients with FH that were not treated, 67 had a CAC0 25, 17 and 25 with a CAC equal to 1100, 101400 and 400, respectively Conclusion In patients with definite or probable FH, CAC may refine CV risk assessment and may be helpful in discussions about treatment strategies,,Background During the COVID19 pandemic, Tunisia adopted a preventive health policy, consisting of containment, selfquarantine, and social distancing to reduce viral contamination Many health care workers noticed a decrease in urgent admissions in different medical wards and intensive care units In this work, we aimedxa0to evaluate the impact of COVID19 preventive measurements on the number of patients admissions in a Tunisian intensive cardiac care unit Methods We collected the number of admissions in the ICCU of Charles Nicolles Hospital of Tunis for acute myocardial infarction and acute heart failure during February, March, and April of the years 2018, 2019, and 2020 and compared the number of admissions between those periods In Tunisia, containment has already started on March, 22nd We also compared the mean number of admissions per day between the precontainment period 40 days before and the containment period 40 days after, and the mean number of admissions per week during the 6 weeks after March, 22nd Results During the three months, the overall number of admissions declined respectively from 103, 100 in 2018, 2019 to 75 in 2020 showing a 25 drop in overall admissions The mean number of admissions dropped significantly from1093 patientday precontainment period to 06081 patientday during the containment period WilcoxonMannWhitney test P 0,024 The mean number of admissions per week during the 6 weeks after March, 22nd dropped respectively from 766175 and 76632 in 2018 and 2019 to 416325 patients per week in 2020 KruskalWallis test, P 013 Fig 1 Conclusion Many reasons could explain this slight drop in ICU admissions during containment such as the lack of public transport, the business of our emergency hotlines with the COVID 19 calls, and even patients fear of being infected by the virus in hospitals This can lead to an increase in sudden cardiac deaths, heart failures due to this lack of medical care,Background Coronary artery disease CAD and iron deficiency ID are two common pathologies, but the potential role of iron in the pathophysiology of CAD through inflammation and atherosclerosis is still being debated Objective To evaluate the prevalence and prognosis of ID in CAD patient after acute myocardial infarction AMI Method Patients hospitalised for AMI in two cardiology centres were screened for ID in the first 48hours after admittance ID was defined as transferring saturation less than 20 TSAT20 Allcause mortality 6 months after MI was the primary endpoint GRACE and CRUSADE scores, left ventricular ejection fraction LVEF, severity of CAD defined by TIMI and SYNTAX angiographic scores, length of hospital stay LOS, increased Creactive protein CRP, troponin IC, and natriuretic peptides were the secondary endpoints Results Half 49 of the 145 patients included were diagnosed with ID average age 665134 years, 30 were women and 30 over 75 years old Six months overall survival of ID patients was impaired 831 vs 100, in nonID patients P 0001 On admittance, ID patients also had increased GRACE and CRUSADE scores P 00001 and001, respectively lower LVEF P 001 more frequent coronary occlusions P 0004 higher SYNTAX score P 00001 more common multivessel involvement P 0007 LOS often over one week P 0001 more severe inflammation P 00001 higher natriuretic peptides levels P 003 Fig 1 Conclusion ID is highly prevalent among patients hospitalised for MI and associated with higher mortality at 6 months and greater severity of CAD Whether its presence impacts longterm survival needs further studies,Background Coronary artery calcifications CAC scoring assessed by the Agatston score has shown an excellent prognostic value in large studies and particularly in diabetic patients, with a very low rate of cardiovascular events in patients with a zero Agatston score Moreover, recent studies have suggested that highsensitive cardiac troponin I hscTnI and brain natriuretic peptide BNP may be useful for detecting subclinical atherosclerosis However, the link between hscTnIBNP and the Agatston score has not been investigated in patients with diabetes Purpose The aim of this study was to investigate if hscTnI and BNP can bring additional value to predict zero Agatston score in patients with diabetes mellitus in addition to usual risk factors Methods Between 2015 and 2019, CAC score was prospectively performed in consecutive patients with diabetes mellitus Patients with symptoms, known coronary artery disease or history of atrial fibrillation were excluded Within 24h from CT examination, peripheral blood samples were taken to measure hscTnI and BNP The relationship between serum hscTnIBNP concentrations and zero Agatston score was assessed using univariate and multivariate binomial models The implication of hscTnI and BNP in this multivariate model was evaluated using nested models associated with Chi2 test of independence Results A total of 844 patients with diabetes were enrolled 617years, 57 men, mean duration of diabetes 18years In this population, 29435 had a zero Agatston score, 25330 an Agatston score from 1 to 100, 16119 from 101 to 400, and 13616 higher than 400 In univariate analysis, hscTnI and BNP concentrations were associated withxa0zero Agatston score respectively OR, 263 95CI, 151501 P 0001 and OR, 109 95CI, 101122 P  003 In multivariate analysis, hscTnI and BNP concentrations were associated with zero Agatston score respectively OR, 238 95CI, 151476 P  0009 and OR, 118 95CI, 107132 P  0001 The multivariate model included age, gender, smoking, dyslipidemia, duration of diabetes, hypertension, diabetic neuropathy, hscTnI and BNP concentrations, significantly discriminated the zero Agatston score AUC081 P 0001 Fig 1 The most discriminant threshold was 3ngl for hscTnI and 17ngl for BNP In nested models, both hscTnI and BNP brought information to this multivariate model to predict a zero Agatston score respectively P  0003 and P 0001 Moreover, removing hscTnI and BNP from the model results in a significant reduction in model performance AUC079 P  0004 Conclusion Cardiac biomarkers hscTnI and BNP are associated with zero Agatston score, which is correlated with a very low risk of cardiovascular events, in asymptomatic patients with diabetes mellitus,Background Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy HCM is a genetic disease with delayed cardiac expression Family screening strategy includes cardiac screening that may be guided by predictive genetic testing PGT However, little is known about the impact of PGT and the risk factors present at the very early stage of the disease Purpose Our study aims to evaluate the impact of predictive genetic testing on the rate of initiation of cardiac screening, to estimate the penetrance of HCM and to determine the frequency of risk factors RF for sudden cardiac death in individuals at preclinical stage without HCM Results We studied 60 consecutive relatives in a single center 31 women and 29 men, mean age 34163 years without history of HCM before genetic testing and who were mutation carriers after PGT Cardiac screening was initiated before PGT in only 37, and was started after PGT in 63 Echocardiographic criteria for HCM were observed in 17 28 of men but 6 of women, 17 of MYH7 mutation carriers but 0 in MYBPC3 carriers Among mutation carriers without hypertrophy n 50, 1 had nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, 2 had nonexplained syncope and 5 presented with family history of sudden death In addition, 14 had dilated left atrium, 2 a high risk mutation and 8 practiced intense physical activity Moreover, 10 221 of carriers who performed MRI had cardiac fibrosis and 3 132 of carriers who performed Holter monitoring had significant premature ventricular beat PVB240day Conclusion The assessment of HCM causal mutations in relatives seems to be an important step to initiate cardiac screening The penetrance of HCM seems to be higher in the male population and in MYH7 rather than in other genes mutation carriers Mutations carriers at a preclinical stage without hypertrophy may have individual risk factors of sudden cardiac death Further study of a larger population may be useful to confirm these results,,,,,,,Purpose To determine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome MS in rural areas of the Republic of the Congo Methods This crosssectional study was conducted from Mayxa0to Junexa045 days, in a rural localities in northern Congo Screening made possible the collect of sociodemographic, clinical and biological data Portable devices helped to carry out blood analyzes The definitions of MS were those of NCEPATPIII, IDF 2006 and IDF central Africa Results In total, 609 subjects were involved, including 371 women 61 The mean age was 45153 years range 18 and 85 Anomalies identified were high waist circumference n 327, 537, systolic blood pressure 130mm Hg n 255, 42, diastolic blood pressure 85mm Hg n 200, 328, serum triglycerides 15gL n 96, 158, low HDL cholesterol 05gL n 226, 371 and fasting blood glucose 1gL n 134, 22 The prevalence of MS was 271 according to NCEPATPIII, 327 IDF 2006 and 312 IDF Central Africa Associated factors of MS in the multivariate analysis were age upper 65 years adjusted OR 37, 95 CI 13119, P 001, high standard of living adjusted OR 23, 95 CI 1147 P 002, history of arterial hypertension adjusted OR 35, 95 CI 261, P 0001 and diabetes adjusted OR 71, 95 CI 1847, P 001 Conclusion The prevalence of MS is worrying in rural areas of republic of the Congo Effective management of patients is needed in order to limit the occurrence of complications,The coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 The disease mainly affects respiratory system Its common clinical findings include fever, cough and shortness of breath Characteristic radiological features of the disease include peripherally distributed, bilateral groundglass opacities, predominantly involving the lower lung zones In this report, we present a case of COVID19 disease presenting with spontaneous pneumothorax A 26year male patient was admitted to the Emergency Department with fever, dry cough, shortness of breath and rightsided chest pain Radiographic imaging of the patient revealed pneumothorax on the right and peripherally distributed nonhomogenous opacification The patient underwent right lateral tube thoracostomy COVID19 was diagnosed on testing of nasopharyngeal swab In conclusion, spontaneous pneumothorax is one of the rare presentations of COVID19 pneumonia and should be kept in mind in patients presenting with shortness of breath and chest pain Key Words Spontaneous pneumothorax, Corona, pneumonia,Cardiac disorders contribute to one of the major causes of fatality across the world Hypertensive patients, even well maintained on drugs, possess a high risk to cardiovascular diseases It is, therefore, highly important to identify different factors and pathways that lead to risk and progression of cardiovascular disorders Several animals and human studies suggest that taxonomical alterations in the gut are involved in the cardiovascular physiology In this article, with the help of various experimental evidences, we suggest that the host gutmicrobiota plays an important in this pathway Short chain fatty acids SCFAs and Trimethyl Amine nOxide TMAO are the two major products of gut microbiome SCFAs present a crucial role in regulating the blood pressure, while TMAO is involved in pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and other coronary artery diseases, including hypertension We prove that there exists a triangular bridge connecting the gap between dietary salt, hypertension and gut microbiome We also present some of the dietary interventions which can regulate and control microbiota that can prevent cardiovascular complicationsWe strongly believe that this article would improve the understanding the role of gut microbiota in hypertension, and will be helpful in the development of novel therapeutic strategies for prevention of hypertension through restoring gut microbiome homeostasis in the near future,PurposeIntermittent hypoxia IH is characterized by hypoxiareoxygenation, reported to be a critical risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea OSA This experiment aimed to evaluate the direct effects of IH on the human nasal mucosaMethodsThe direct effects of IH on the human nasal mucosa was evaluated by measuring the ciliary beat frequency CBF and expression levels of inflammatory cytokines granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor, transforming growth factorβ, interleukin6, and tumor necrosis factorα The normoxia group was exposed to a normoxic condition for 72 h The IH group was exposed to 288 cycles of IH 1 cycle hypoxia, 5 min subsequent normoxia, 10 min for 72 h CBF was measured using an automated computerbased video image processing technique Changes in the expression of cytokines were assessed by realtime reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction RTPCRResultsThe normoxia group revealed a persistent CBF pattern and a physiological range of inflammatory cytokines However, the IH group showed a cyclic decrease in CBF and increased expression of inflammatory cytokines Cytotoxicity assay indicated no difference in the survival rates between the two groupsConclusionsIH results in increased expression of inflammatory cytokines that adversely affects the mucociliary transport in the upper airway and, consequently, may result in airway inflammation,,,As the first winner of the new 2020 British Society for Heart Failure Lynda Blue Award, Jayne Masters shares her experiences in this first instalment of the Spotlight on Nurses series,Rosalynn Austin and Tootie Bueser report on the BANCCs online forum for existing and aspiring cardiovascular nurse researchers to find out what is needed to support and champion these individuals in this challenging field,In this study, we report a familial cluster of cases which included five patients and two close contacts who were confirmed to have coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 These participants had received realtime reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction RTPCR and chest Xrays CXRs before diagnosis The followup CXRs of three patients in the family showed significant progression, with COVID19 pneumonia, clinically worsening in a short period of time Therefore, the results of followup CXRs in the shortterm may be an adjunctive diagnostic method for COVID19 disease diagnosis and its progression Key Words Chest Xray, COVID19, RTPCR, Familial clustering,,OBJECTIVE To compare the diagnostic accuracies of HRCT chest and RTPCR results in diagnosis of coronavirus disease COVID19 in a tertiary care hospital in Lahore STUDY DESIGN Descriptive study PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY Department of Radiology and Central Research Lab, Lahore General Hospital, Lahore, from April to July, 2020 METHODOLOGY Patients aged 18 to 83 years, who had clinically suspected symptoms of COVID19 fever, coughsore throat or shortness of breath presenting in outpatient or emergency department, were included These patients had their HRCT chest conducted from Radiology Department and RTPCR performed at Central Research Lab These data were retrieved from electronic system of PACS Results were categorised into positive and negative findings for COVID19 Diagnostic accuracies of HRCT chest and first RTPCR along with 95 confidence interval were calculated RESULTS A total

RTPCR, HRCT chest, Sensitivity, Specificity,ABSTRACTxa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0 The clinical manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19associated pneumonia show a wide range of variations It ranges from mild hypoxemia without significant signs of respiratory distress, to rapid clinically deteriorating course with severe hypoxemia Unexplained severe hypoxemia, associated with platypnea, triggers the possibility of ventilationperfusion VQ mismatch, ranging from intrapulmonary shunts IPS to alveolar dead space ventilation In the literature, very few cases with COVID19pneumonia have been reported with IPS Herein, we report a COVID19 confirmed 45year male patient, who developed IPS without apparent pulmonary perfusion defect on lung perfusion scintigraphy The patient had no cardiovascular disease except chronic pulmonary hypertension secondary to interstitial lung disease The clinical manifestations combined with nuclear imaging features enabled in making the ultimate diagnosis The patients clinical condition improved on appropriate clinical management, using high flow oxygen combined with intravenous steroids and anticoagulants Key Words COVID19, Adult respiratory distress syndrome, Right to left shunt, Lung perfusion scintigraphy, Platypnea,ABSTRACT The involvement of the vascular endothelium in the complications of coronavirus disease 2019 is now recognized Chief among these are pulmonary endotheliitis, cytokine storm, endotoxic shock, and cardiovascular collapse This Perspectives article is focused on therapeutical strategies to reduce the risk of these complications by targeting the vascular endothelium as a part of the overall treatment of coronavirus disease 2019,We examined the relative contribution of pulmonary diseases chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and sleep apnea to mortality risks associated with Coronavirus Disease COVID19 independent of other medical conditions, health risks, and sociodemographic factors Data were derived from a large USbased case series of patients with COVID19, captured from a quaternary academic health network covering New York City and Long Island From March 2 to May 24, 2020, 11,512 patients who were hospitalized were tested for COVID19, with 4,446 3862 receiving a positive diagnosis for COVID19 Among those who tested positive, 959 2157 died of COVID19related complications at the hospital Multivariateadjusted Cox proportional hazards modeling showed mortality risks were strongly associated with greater age HR  105 95 CI 104105, ethnic minority Asians, NonHispanic blacks, and Hispanics HR  126 95 CI, 110144, low household income HR  129 95 CI 111, 149, and male sex HR  085 95 CI 074, 097 Higher mortality risks were also associated with a history of COPD HR  127 95 CI 102158, obesity HR  119 95 CI 104137, and peripheral artery disease HR  133 95 CI 105169 Findings indicate patients with COPD had the highest odds of COVID19 mortality compared with patients with preexisting metabolic conditions, such as obesity, diabetes and hypertension Sociodemographic factors including increased age, male sex, low household income, ethnic minority status were also independently associated with greater mortality risks,Sudden cardiac death is commonly seen due to arrhythmias, which is a common cardiac manifestation seen in COVID19 patients, especially those with underlying cardiovascular disease CVD Administration of hydroxychloroquine HCQ as a potential treatment option during SARSCoV2, initially gained popularity, but later, its safe usage became questionable due to its cardiovascular safety, largely stemming from instances of cardiac arrhythmias in COVID19 Moreover, in the setting of rheumatic diseases, in whichxa0patients are usually on HCQ for their primary disease, there is a need to scale the merits and demerits of HCQ usage for the treatment of COVID19 In this narrative review, we aim to address the association between usage of HCQ and sudden cardiac death in COVID19 patients MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClinicalTrialsgov and SCOPUS databases were used to review articles in English ranging from case reports, case series, letter to editors, systematic reviews, narrative reviews, observational studies and randomized control trials HCQ is a potential cause of sudden cardiac death in COVID19 patients As opposed to the reduction in CVD with HCQ in treatment of systemic lupus erythematous, rheumatoid arthritis, and other rheumatic diseases, safe usage of HCQ in COVID19 patients is unclear whereby, it is observed to result in QTc prolongation and Torsades dexa0pointesxa0even in patients with no underlying cardiovascular comorbidity This is occasionally associated with sudden cardiac death or cardiac arrest hence, its clinical efficacy needs further investigation by largescalexa0clinical trials,Multisystem involvement and rapid clinical deterioration are hallmarks of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 related mortality The unique clinical phenomena in severe COVID19 can be perplexing, and they include disproportionately severe hypoxemia relative to lung alveolarparenchymal pathology and rapid clinical deterioration, with poor response to O2 supplementation, despite preserved lung mechanics Factors such as microvascular injury, thromboembolism, pulmonary hypertension, and alteration in hemoglobin structure and function could play important roles Overwhelming immune response associated with cytokine storms could activate reactive oxygen species ROS, which may result in consumption of nitric oxide NO, a critical vasodilation regulator In other inflammatory infections, activated neutrophils are known to release myeloperoxidase MPO in a natural immune response, which contributes to production of hypochlorous acid HOCl However, during overwhelming inflammation, HOCl competes with O2 at heme binding sites, decreasing O2 saturation Moreover, HOCl contributes to several oxidative reactions, including hemoglobinheme iron oxidation, heme destruction, and subsequent release of free iron, which mediates toxic tissue injury through additional generation of ROS and NO consumption Connecting these reactions in a multihit model can explain generalized tissue damage, vasoconstriction, severe hypoxia, and precipitous clinical deterioration in critically ill COVID19 patients Understanding these mechanisms is critical to develop therapeutic strategies to combat COVID19,STUDY OBJECTIVES This study was done to find out prevalence of Metabolic syndrome MS in patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea OSA and whether there is any difference in prevalence of syndrome Z in male and female METHODOLOGY All consecutive diagnosed patients with OSA between June 2015 and Oct 2019 were screened for metabolic syndrome and factors associated with metabolic syndrome in OSA were analyzed RESULTS During study period, 502 patients 357 males 145 females were diagnosed with OSA Mean age was

publication, the first and last name of all the Authors was inadvertently swapped The correct Author group has been provided below,After decades of notoriety for its adverse cardiovascular, proinflammatory and profibrotic actions, the reninangiotensin system RAS began to be cast in a more favorable light with the discovery of angiotensinconverting enzyme2 ACE2 in 2000 This monocarboxypeptidase, best known for its ability to metabolize angiotensin Ang II to Ang 17, counteracts the adverse effects of Ang II mediated by the AT1 Ang II receptor Ang peptides are classically considered to be metabolized by aminopeptidases, by which the nomenclature Ang III desAsp1Ang II, 28 heptapeptide and Ang IV desAsp1desArg2Ang II, 38 hexapeptide are derived This report compares the ability of recombinant human ACE2 rhACE2 to metabolize Ang III, Ang IV and Ang V, 48 pentapeptide relative to Ang II to form corresponding desomegaPhe metabolites rhACE2 has highest affinity lowest Km for Ang III, followed by Ang II ∼ Ang V, followed by Ang IV However, rhACE2 has the highest Kcat for metabolising Ang IV followed by Ang V, Ang III and Ang II The enzymatic efficiency KcatKm is highest for Ang V and Ang III followed by Ang IV and is lowest for Ang II As a gluzincin metallopeptidase, ACE2 requires a zinc molecule at its active site for catalysis This report also documents inhibition of ACE2 activity by concentrations of zinc exceeding 10 μM These observations extend the functional significance of ACE2 to include the metabolic inactivation of Ang III, Ang IV and Ang V, reemphasizing the importance of monitoring zinc intake to maintain metabolic homeostasis,BackgroundGraft thrombosis due to fabric delamination is a rare cause of delayed failure of arteriovenous grafts Graft delamination is primarily an imaging diagnosis and is confirmed with the help of ultrasound which shows the separation of graft fabric layers Only two such cases have been described in the literature so farCase presentationWe present a case of upper extremity arteriovenous graft thrombosis in a 79u2009year old COVID19 positive patient with endstage renal disease The diagnosis was established on ultrasonography which revealed separation of the graft fabric layers with thrombosis within the false and true lumen of the graft The patient was managed with angioplasty and embolectomy of the clot material followed by stentgraft placement across the delaminated portion of the graft Postprocedural angiography confirmed brisk flow across the graft and patient could successfully have subsequent hemodialysis sessionsConclusionsIdentification of graft delamination as a cause of graft failure is important as its management differs from other conventional causes since it requires stentgrafts to cover the area of delamination to reestablish flow and salvage the AV graft The recognition of this phenomenon is essential to provide quality care and successful reuse of the AV graftLevel of evidenceLevel 4, Case Report,Telogen effluvium TE, a common hair disease, is supposed to be related to stress, which could be secondary to poor sleep We call attention to the current COVID19 pandemic, that is leading to an increase in the prevalence of sleep disturbances, and as a consequence, higher states of stress and anxiety, which are possible triggers for TE In parallel, trichodynia is a sensorial symptom that is commonly related with hair diseases, including TE We argue that substance P, a neuropeptide that has participation in the neuroinflammation and in the sleep regulation, may play a possible role in this scalp paresthesia We suggest that there may be an association between this substrate and sleep, which can aggravate trichodynia and TE Further studies on this subject could provide more evidence on these relationships, and help to improve the patients quality of life and management of the condition,,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 that causes the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 has infected millions of individuals and has claimed hundreds of thousands of human lives worldwide Patients with underlying cardiovascular conditions are at high risk for SARSCoV2 infection, and COVID19 patients have high incidence of cardiovascular complications such as acute cardiac injury, arrhythmias, heart failure, and thromboembolism The disease has no approved proven effective therapy and hence repurposing of existing approved drugs has been considered as the fastest treatment approach Statins have been shown to exhibit lipid lowering dependent and independent cardiovascular protective effects as well as favorable effects in various other pathophysiological states These beneficial properties of statins are a result of their multiple pleotropic effects that include, antiinflammatory, immunomodulatory, antithrombotic and antimicrobial properties In this review, we provide a comprehensive description of the mechanisms of the pleotropic effects of statins, the relevant preclinical and clinical data pertinent to their role in infections and acute lung injury, the possible cardiovascular benefits of statins in COVID19, and the implications of the therapeutic potential of statins in COVID19 disease We conclude with the rationale for conducting randomized controlled trials of statins in COVID19 disease,In the current coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic, air medical transport has been faced with many challenges that have been taken for granted in the past The transport of these patients has been shrouded in many controversies, from the appropriate level of personal protective equipment, what facilities are appropriate for which patients, and the appropriate means of transport for COVID19 patients When you add in multiple highrisk comorbidities, as well as specialized devices and treatment, the care becomes even more complicated The case of a 34yearold, 150kg, pregnant female who presented to a critical access hospital with shortness of breath and rapid decompensation presented unique challenges when she tested positive for COVID19 The patient underwent a cesarean section and rapidly decompensated to the point where extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was required A cardiothoracic surgeon and perfusionist were flown with the flight crew to the critical access hospital to cannulate the patient before transport because of the patients severely unstable hemodynamic status The patient was admitted to a tertiary facility for multiple rounds of treatments and was later discharged back to the critical access hospital for rehabilitation and recovery,BACKGROUND Spain has been severely affected by the COVID19 epidemic, with 195,944 persons infected and 20,453 deaths at the time of writing Older people with respiratory or cardiac conditions are most at risk OBJECTIVE The aim was to compare respiratory symptoms in nursing home residents and patients with uncontrolled asthma, who are considered vulnerable to COVID19 METHODS We studied 134 nursing home residents and 139 patients with uncontrolled asthma, groups vulnerable to COVID19 Demographic characteristics, clinical manifestations, outcomes, key laboratory results, and radiological images were collected from medical records COVID19 infection was detected by polymerase chain reaction PCR RESULTS Thirteen 93 patients with uncontrolled asthma, all receiving inhaled corticosteroids were infected by COVID19 Eighty 60 nursing home residents were infected only 28, all of whom had received inhaled corticosteroids, had a good prognosis CONCLUSIONS Early treatment with inhaled corticosteroids may be helpful in COVID19 infection Persons with an allergy might have some protective mechanisms against coronavirus,Aim First responder FR programmes dispatch professional FRs police andor firefighters or citizen responders to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation CPR and use automated external defibrillators AED in outofhospital cardiac arrest OHCA We aimed to describe management of FRprogrammes across Europe in response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic Methods In June 2020, we conducted a crosssectional survey sent to OHCA registry representatives in 18 European countries with active FRprogrammes The survey was administered by email and included questions regarding management of both citizen responder and FRprogrammes A followup question was conducted in October 2020 assessing management during a potential second wave of COVID19 Results All representatives responded response ratexa0xa0100 Fourteen regions dispatched citizen responders and 17 regions dispatched professional FRs 9 regions dispatched both Responses were posthoc divided into three categories FR activation continued unchanged, FR activation continued with restrictions, or FR activation temporarily paused For citizen responders, regions either temporarily paused activation nxa0xa07, 500 or continued activation with restrictions nxa0xa07, 500 The most common restriction was to omit rescue breaths and perform compressiononly CPR For professional FRs, nine regions continued activation with restrictions 529 and five regions 294 continued activation unchanged, but with personal protective equipment available for the professional FRs In three regions 176, activation of professional FRs temporarily paused Conclusion Most regions changed management of FRprogrammes in response to the COVID19 pandemic Studies are needed to investigate the consequences of pausing or restricting FRprogrammes for bystander CPR and AED use, and how this may impact patient outcome,Systemic inflammatory response due to cytokine storm in severe COVID19 cases can lead to acute myocardial infarction, also affecting the younger population, without significant risk factors We present the case of a 36yearold male with morbid obesity and wellcontrolled asthma who had developed COVID19induced acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation and, subsequently, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ECMO who developed myocardial infarction on Day 10 of admission and died on Day 15 of admission due to sequelae of severe COVID19 infection In young patients with COVID19induced respiratory infection, severe inflammatory response can lead to acute coronary syndrome in absence of obstructive lesions or plaque ruptures,Heart failure as a comorbidity in the older population with COVID19 poses an additional threat to those affected Patients with both COVID19 and heart failure share similar risk factors, which result in magnification of pathological outcomes These include a common inflammatory pathology and related coagulopathy Both illnesses pose a risk of arrhythmia Polypharmacy further complicates safe drug administration and worsens the risk of medicationinduced arrhythmia Additionally, both conditions present challenges regarding attaining and maintaining an appropriate nutritional state Exploration of the interplay between these factors demonstrates the gravity of the coexistence of these conditions and helps understand the difficulties faced when caring for this patient group Although care provided to COVID19 patients is primarily related to symptom presentation, based on the analysis conducted, there are some recommendations for practice in relation to evidence and guidelines when managing heart failure patients in primary care within the context of the COVID19 pandemic,Purpose of ReviewCoronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 has become a global pandemic associated with significant morbidity and mortality This review summarizes findings up to date on the relationship between cardiovascular disease CVD and COVID19Recent FindingsPreexisting CVD is a common condition among patients with COVID19 and is associated with increased disease severity and mortality Conversely, COVID19 has various clinical manifestations on cardiovascular system, including thrombotic events and cardiac dysfunction The pandemic has impacted healthcare utilization among patients with CVD, which may have led to potential delay in access to the healthcare system during acute events not directly COVID19relatedSummaryWhile COVID19 vaccine is being developed and distributed, controlling CVD risk factors and adherence to recommendations of existing immunization eg, influenza vaccine are key in protecting the health of individuals with CVD during the COVID19 pandemic Further research is needed to understand the epidemiological and pathophysiological basis for the interaction between CVD and COVID19,Patients with Coronavirusassociated disease2019 COVID19 display alterations of the hemostatic system and the presence of a prothrombotic status frequently leading to vascular complications However, the impact of COVID19 on platelet activity, aggregation and agglutination still needs to be clarified We measured total levels of von Willebrand factor vWF and vWF binding to the platelet glycoprotein Gp complex GPIbIXV, in a cohort of COVID19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit of our Institution Moreover, we evaluated platelet aggregation in response to agonists ADP, collagen, arachidonic acid and platelet agglutination in response to ristocetin We found that levels of vWF antigen and the active form of vWF binding to platelets vWFRCo, were markedly increased in these patients These results were associated with higher agglutination rates induced by ristocetin, thereby indirectly indicating an increased capability of vWF to bind to platelets Conversely, we found that platelet aggregation in response to both ADP and collagen was lower in COVID19 patients compared to healthy volunteers This study shows that COVID19 is associated with increased vWFinduced platelet agglutination but reduced platelet responsivity to aggregation stimuli Our findings have translational relevance since platelet adhesion to vWF may represent a marker to predict possible complications and better delineate therapeutic strategies in COVID19 patients,Emerging data have demonstrated a strong association between the gut microbiota and the development of cardiovascular disease CVD risk factors such as atherosclerosis, inflammation, obesity, insulin resistance, platelet hyperactivity, and plasma lipid abnormalities Several studies in humans and animal models have demonstrated an association between gut microbial metabolites such as trimethylamineNoxide TMAO, shortchain fatty acids, and bile acid metabolites amino acid breakdown products with CVD Human blood platelets are a critical contributor to the hemostatic process Besides, these blood cells play a crucial role in developing atherosclerosis and, finally, contribute to cardiac events Since the TMAO, and other metabolites of the gut microbiota, are asociated with platelet hyperactivity, lipid disorders, and oxidative stress, the dietgut microbiota interactions have become an important research area in the cardiovascular field The gut microbiota and their metabolites may be targeted for the therapeutic benefit of CVD from a clinical perspective This reviews main aim is to highlight the complex interactions between microbiota, their metabolites, and several CVD risk factors,,,,Rationale To identify whether the initial chest computed tomography CT findings of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 are helpful for predicting the clinical outcome Methods A total of 224 patients with laboratoryconfirmed COVID19 who underwent chest CT examination within the first day of admission were enrolled CT findings, including the pattern and distribution of opacities, the number of lung lobes involved and the chest CT scores of lung involvement, were assessed Independent predictors of adverse clinical outcomes were determined by multivariate regression analysis Adverse outcome were defined as the need for mechanical ventilation or death Results Of 224 patients, 74 33 had adverse outcomes and 150 67 had good outcomes There were higher frequencies of more than four lung zones involved 73 vs 32, both central and peripheral distribution 57 vs 42, consolidation 27 vs 17, and air bronchogram 24 vs 13 and higher initial chest CT scores 8634 vs 5421 P  005 for all in the patients with poor outcomes Multivariate analysis demonstrated that more than four lung zones odds ratio OR 393 95 confidence interval CI 144 to 1289, age above 65 OR 365 95 CI 111 to 1059, the presence of comorbidity OR 521 95 CI 164 to 1922 and dyspnea on admission OR 319 95 CI 135 to 846 were independent predictors of poor outcome Conclusions Involvement of more than four lung zones and a higher CT score on the initial chest CT were significantly associated with adverse clinical outcome Initial chest CT findings may be helpful for predicting clinical outcome in patients with COVID19,Laryngotracheal stenosis LTS is a rare but serious condition characterized by narrowing of the airway Iatrogenic injury from endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy insertion is the most common cause of LTS We present the first reported experience of managing a patient diagnosed with subglottic stenosis a subtype of LTS following previous intubation and tracheostomy for coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 This patient required an urgent surgical tracheostomy and subsequent referral to a tertiary airway surgery unit for definitive treatment, which included microlaryngoscopy, laser excision and balloon dilatation This case highlights that LTS should be included in the differential diagnosis for patients representing with breathing difficulties after prolonged intubation or tracheostomy for COVID19 Furthermore, it raises the concern of a rise in the incidence of this condition and an increased burden on the few units specializing in airway surgery,Background SARSCoronavirus2 COVID19 infection is a pandemic with various clinical presentations including pericarditis whichxa0seems to be rare Purpose The aim of this observational cohort study was to describe characteristics and management of the patients hospitalized for pericarditis secondary to COVID 19xa0in the Hospital of Haguenau, France Methods We retrospectively enrolled patients admittedxa0for pericarditisxa0secondary to COVID 19 affection,xa0either confirmed by a typical chest CT scan, or a positive Covid 19 PCR Data were collected by a careful review of their medical record Results 7 patients 4 men, 3 womenxa0were included,

shown to improve refractory hypoxemia and mortality in patients with ARDS Methods In this simulation, a 70yearold male had been transferred to the ICU for ARDS and was undergoing scheduled prone ventilation as part of his care when he experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest secondary to a tension pneumothorax Learners demonstrated how to manage cardiac arrest in a prone patient and subsequently identified and treated the tension pneumothorax that was the cause of his initial arrest This singlesession simulation for internal medicine residents PGY 1PGY 4 utilized a prone mannequin connected to a ventilator in a highfidelity simulation center Following the simulation, facilitators led a team debriefing and reviewed key learning objectives Results A total of 103 internal medicine residents participated in this simulation Of those, 43 responded to a postsimulation survey Fortytwo of 43 agreed or strongly agreed that all learning objectives were met, that the simulation was appropriate for their level of training, and that their participation would be useful for their future practice Discussion We designed this simulation to improve learners familiarity with prone cardiopulmonary resuscitation and to enhance overall comfort with cardiac arrest management Postsimulation survey results and debriefings revealed that the simulation was a valuable education opportunity, and learners felt that their participation in this simulation would be helpful in their future practice,Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2, a novel pathogen, has caused an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 that has spread rapidly around the world Determining the risk factors for death and the differences in clinical features between severely ill and critically ill patients with SARSCoV2 pneumonia has become increasingly important Aim This study was intended to provide insight into the difference between severely ill and critically ill patients with SARSCoV2 pneumonia Methods In this retrospective, multicenter cohort study, we enrolled 62 seriously ill patients with SARSCoV2 pneumonia who had been diagnosed by March 12, 2020 Clinical data, laboratory indexes, chest images, and treatment strategies collected from routine medical records were compared between severely ill and critically ill patients Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were also conducted to identify the risk factors associated with the progression of patients with severe COVID19 Results Of the 62 patients with severe or critical illness, including 7 who died, 30 48 patients had underlying diseases, of which the most common was cardiovascular disease hypertension, 34, and coronary heart disease, 5 Compared to patients with severe disease, those with critical disease had distinctly higher white blood cell counts, procalcitonin levels, and Ddimer levels, and lower hemoglobin levels and lymphocyte counts Multivariate regression showed that a lymphocyte count less than 109L odds ratio 2092, 95 CI 17624818 p002 at admission increased the risk of developing a critical illness Conclusion Based on multivariate regression analysis, a lower lymphocyte count 109L on admission is the most critical independent factor that is closely associated with an increased risk of progression to critical illness Age, underlying diseases, especially hypertension and coronary heart disease, elevated Ddimer, decreased hemoglobin, and SOFA score, and APACH score also need to be taken into account for predicting disease progression Blood cell counts and procalcitonin levels for the later secondary bacterial infection have a certain reference values,,,,,,,Acute Heart Failure AHF is a lifethreatening, rapid onset or worsening of sign andor symptoms of heart failure HF which often requires urgent hospitalization for rapid evaluation and treatment It may present as de novo or, more frequently, as a result of acute decompensation of chronic heart failure ADHF Apart from the economic burden on patient and health care system, each AHF related hospitalization is associated with significant increases in 12month rehospitalization and mortality rate 44 and 17 in ESCHF pilot study 302 and 308 in Trivandrum Heart Failure Registry Maggioni et al 2013, Harikrishnan et al 2017 1,2 As of July 15th, India has about 936,181 cases and nearly 24,309 death attributed to novel coronavirus disease 2019 Covid19 infection Solomon et al, nd 3 Unprecedented apprehension due to the rapid spread of COVID19 pandemic has resulted in hospital avoiding behavior among patients suffering other diseases, including HF Also, spread of COVID19 pandemic attracted the major allocation of healthcare infrastructure and human resources, including emergency services, for the care of COVID19 infected patients, and little is known about the effect of this stressedout healthcare system on short and long term outcome in patients suffering from HF Although, the implementation of lockdown by the Government from March 25, 2020 initially slowed the community spread of COVID19, but inadvertently, suspension of public transport further affected the delivery of medical care for HF patients, as most of the patients in India still use public transport for their emergency department ED visits In this study, we performed a retrospective analysis of all consecutive patients who were admitted for AHF de novo and ADHF left ventricular ejection fraction 40 in two Medical college hospitals providing healthcare services in Jodhpur, western India Both are regional tertiary care centres of local hub and spike networks for the management of various cardiovascular emergencies Our EDs have a separate registration desks for patients coming with nonCovid19 emergencies and COVID19 symptoms, with clear signs at the entrance directing patients to the designated registration desk Also, ED was expanded to avoid overcrowding and separate waiting area was created for those who have COVID19 signs and symptoms We analysed demographic, clinical, echocardiographic and outcome parameters in patients admitted for AHF during the study period of 16u202fweeks March 25 to July 14, 2020 starting from the day when lockdown was imposed by Government of India and compared this data with a control period of 16u202fweeks Dec 05, 2019 to March 24, 2020 when there was no lockdown and number of COVID19 attributed death 10 In addition, hospitalization rates during the study period were also compared with data from the same period in 201819 Patients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 were not included in study Our analysis of patients admitted during the study lockdown period revealed 69 reduction in AHF hospitalizations as compared to the control period 241 vs 782 and 60 reduction compared to same calendar period from the previous year 144 vs 602 Figure 1 It was contrary to an expected increase due to the availability issue of guidelinedirected medical therapy in followup patients and an anticipated surge in AHF due to late presentation of patients with acute myocardial infarction associated mechanical complications Among the patients from the lockdown period, 967 presented with NYHA IV symptoms, this was significantly higher than the rate during the control period out of 782 766 presented with NYHA IV symptoms during the control period p value 0001 Table 1 The mean age SD of patients in study and control period was 635112 and 611119 respectively, with no significant difference Compared with control group, study group patients were more commonly male 826 vs 716 p value 002, more likely to have atrial fibrillation 237 vs 182 p value 002, lower eGFR 646 vs 777 p value 005, lower mean ejection fraction 242u202fu202f56 vs 304u202fu202f49 p value 0001 and higher NT pro BNP levels mean value 73492 vs 56804u202fpgml p value 0001 Median length of stay during study and control period was 5 and 4u202fdays respectively We also observed significantly increased inhospital mortality during the lockdown period as compared to the control period 83 vs 54 p value 0001 The number of patients presenting to ED with AHF in western India has reduced significantly, and yet, late presentations with advanced symptoms and low EF seem to have increased Similar pattern of decreased admission for cardiovascular emergency was reported from California, where weekly rates of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction decreased by up to 48 during the Covid19 period Solomon et al, nd 3 The current case fatality rate for COVID19 in India is approximately 26 4, which is far less than that of AHF and we presume that many untreated AHF patients must have died at home during COVID19 pandemic There have been reports of the inexplicable increase in out of hospital cardiac arrests, revealing that patients were staying too long at home to seek care for a more severe medical condition Wong et al, 2020 5 Complete suspension of public transit system along with lack of emergency medical services in India, risk of acquiring COVID19 at ED and misleading information in media and social platforms about flooding of hospital beds due to COVID19, even when there were reserved wards for other emergencies, led to hospital avoiding behavior among patients suffering from even the most serious medical conditions Hospitals are now erroneously perceived as reservoirs of SARSCoV2 Community educational campaigns are imperative to convey that hospitals are secured, resourceful, and fully prepared for lifethreatening emergencies which if untreated, has higher morbidity and mortality rate as compared to COVID19,,,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2, also known as coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is known to cause a cluster of flulike illnesses and pneumonia with evolving understanding of other systemic manifestations Currently, the known cardiac manifestations of COVID19 include myocardial injury, acute coronary syndrome, and arrhythmias In this report, we describe a case of pericarditisan unusual cardiac manifestation observed in a patient with COVID19 A 63yearold male presented with history of fever, cough and chest pain Electrocardiogram EKG demonstrated diffuse STT wave changes on all the leads, with normal troponinT levels Echocardiograph showed mild pericardial effusion without any regional wall motion abnormality Subsequent chest radiograph and coronary angiography were normal In view of ongoing COVID19 pandemic, nasopharyngeal swab was performed, which was positive Detailed etiological workup for pericarditis, including infectious and inflammatory causes were unremarkable Viral pericarditis possibly caused by COVID19 was diagnosis of exclusion and patient was treated with hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice a day, colchicine 05 mg twice a day, and lopinavirritonavir 200 mg50 mg tablet twice a day for 10 days during admission He was discharged with hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice daily and colchicine 05 mg once daily for 15 days On subsequent followup clinic visit, he reported resolution of symptoms The purpose of this report is to add a potential cardiovascular complication of COVID19 to the literature Awareness of this manifestation can lead to timely laboratory and imaging examinations with potential to provide correct treatment and good outcome,Mucus is an integral part of the respiratory physiology It protects the respiratory tract by acting as a physical barrier against inhaled particles and microbes Excessive inflammation in conditions such as COVID19 can result in overproduction of mucus which obstructs the airway Buildup of mucus can also contribute to recurrent airway infection, causing further obstruction This article summarizes the current understanding and knowledge of respiratory mucus production and proposes the role of cytokine storm in inducing sudden mucus hypersecretion in COVID19 Based on these cascades, the active constituents that inhibit or activate several potential targets are outlined for further research These may be explored for the discovery and design of drugs to combat cytokine storm and its ensuing complications,There is an increasing evidence supporting the existence of coagulopathy in coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 patients Most of reports are mainly focused on ddimer Our objective is to describe coagulation parameters in these patients that could be involved in a hypercoagulate state and to test platelet function to see if there are short closure times We analyzed coagulation samples from 80 patients admitted with COVID19 in our hospital We also tested platelet function by closure times in a small subgroup of patients Most of samples had increased ddimer 962 median of ddimer 1158u200angmlu200aFEU, increased fibrinogen 752 median 523u200agl, increased factor VIII 86 median 2648u200aUdl, decreased protein S 225 of women, 625 of men median 628 and 685u200aUdl, respectively, decreased protein C 76 median 100u200aUdl, decreased factor XII 253 median 903u200aUdl and decreased antithrombin activity 21 median 86u200aUdl International normalized ratio was higher than normal in 24 patients 30 median 113 The activated partial thromboplastin time ratio was below the normal range in nine patients 112 and above normal in three 375 median 093 The closure times were short in the 20 and 40 of samples of collagen and ADP and collagen and epinephrine, respectively Twelve of the 80 patients 15 had a thrombotic event and all had several abnormal coagulation parameters related with increased thrombotic risk The results of this study support a hypercoagulability state in COVID19 patients and it may help to explain the microvascular thrombosis caused by the inflammatory response,,The objective of the study was to investigate and quantify the severity of COVID19 infection by high resolution computed tomography CT of chest and to determine its relationship with clinical parameters This study also aimed to see CT changes with clinical recovery or progression of disease This cross sectional study was performed from July 20 to August 20, 2020, where both chest HRCT and clinical features were included in laboratory confirmed COVID19, 100 patients, attending the depertment of Radiology  Imaging, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University BSMMU, Dhaka, Bangladesh This study included clinical symptoms, comorbidities of patients, HRCT chest characteristics, CT severity score After collection of all required data and careful medical chest review, the clinical data of laboratory confirmed patients was compiled and tabulated In this study group out of 100 patients, most of the patients were in 5th  6th dacades with a mean age of 537 years In this study out of 100 patients 72 were male and 28 were female with an average sex ratio of male  female being 251 Prevalance of various clinical presentation in this study sample population distributed as fever in 76 cough in 774, shortness of breath in 55, sore throat in 17 were the most common clinical manifestations while a few patients 132 also had other symptoms like headache, chest tightnes, anosmia and diarrhoea Major comorbid conditions were diabets mellitus, hypertension, bronchial asthma and Chronic kidney disease CKD Patient with comorbid disease, especially if multiple had higher symptomatic presentation Out of 100 patients 755 patient had comorbidity where as 245 ptaients did not have any coexisting disease According to HRCT imaging severity score the lung pathological changes were evaluated, when typical covid findings in 80, intermediate in 10, atypical in 2 and normal chest CT findings in 8 patients Symptomatic presentation had found higher 8521 who had CT severity index 1525 while sympotomatic presentation lesser 1479 who had CT severity index 1525 CT severity index of 15 was seen in 202173 patients, 610 in 384130 patients, 1115 in 222391 patients, 1620 in 101086 patients and 2125 in 2217 As positive CT findings were more prominent in symptomatic and comorbid patients HRCT chest in COVID19 patient had a major diagnostic and prognostic importance Clinical symptoms of patients directly correlated with CT severity score Therefore, CT imaging was found to be useful in predicting clinical recovery of patient or progression of disease,COVID19 coronavirus disease 2019 patients often show excessive activation of coagulation, associated with increased risk of thrombosis However, the diagnostic value of coagulation at initial clinical evaluation is not clear We present an indepth analysis of coagulation in patients presenting to the emergency department ED with suspected COVID19 N u2009u200958 patients with clinically suspected COVID19 in the ED were enrolled N u2009u200917 subsequently tested positive using SARSCoV2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 polymerase chain reaction PCR swabs, while in n u2009u200941 COVID19 was ruledout We analyzed both standard and extended coagulation parameters, including thromboplastin time INR, activated partial thromboplastin time aPTT, antithrombin, plasminogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor1 PAI1, Ddimers, and fibrinogen at admission, as well as α2antiplasmin, activated protein C resistance, factor V, lupus anticoagulant, protein C, protein S, and von Willebrand diagnostics These data, as well as mortality and further laboratory parameters, were compared across groups based on COVID19 diagnosis and severity of disease In patients with COVID19, we detected frequent clotting abnormalities, including Ddimers The comparison cohort in the ED, however, showed similarly altered coagulation Furthermore, parameters previously shown to distinguish between severe and moderate COVID19 courses, such as platelets, plasminogen, fibrinogen, aPTT, INR, and antithrombin, as well as multiple nonroutine coagulation analytes showed no significant differences between patients with and without COVID19 when presenting to the ED At admission to the ED the prevalence of coagulopathy in patients with COVID19 is high, yet comparable to the nonCOVID19 cohort presenting with respiratory symptoms Nevertheless, coagulopathy might worsen during disease progression with the need of subsequent risk stratification,Trauma remains the leading cause of death in individuals less than 45 years Management of major trauma is protocol driven around the world Most protocols are in line with the popular Advanced Trauma Life Support ATLS principles These principles have been adjudged to be safe and consistent even in the presence of infectious diseases while employing standard precautions In view of the current community spread, large cases of COVID 19 in the Federal Capital Territory FCT and the magnitude of the infectivity, it has become necessary to adjust our local trauma resuscitation protocols in order to ensure the safety of the trauma team and the trauma patients as well,Smoking affects a persons overall health and damages nearly every organ of the body Since smoking tobacco affects and damages the lungs, it increases the risk of respiratory infections and makes it easier for the coronavirus disease COVID19 to invade the lung tissue, causing more severe symptoms and increasing the risk of death However, debates are still ongoing as to the effect of cigarette smoking on vulnerability to COVID19 Some studies, where active smokers were underrepresented among patients with COVID19, claimed that a smokers paradox may exist in COVID19 and that smokers are protected from infection and severe complications of COVID19 However, other studies reported the opposite trend The objective of this study is to review the findings of epidemiological and in vitro studies about the association between smoking and the risk of contracting COVID19, taking into account disease severity Several epidemiological studies have found a higher smoking prevalence among COVID19 infected patients Also, studies had shown that people with respiratory diseases caused by tobacco use are at higher risk of developing severe COVID19 symptoms Studies have shown that in vitro, the acute exposure allows for more severe proximal airway epithelial disease from SARSCoV2 by reducing the mucosal innate immune response and the proliferation of airway basal stem cells and has implications for disease spread and severity in people exposed to cigarette smoke, with a more severe viral infection and cell death Smoker patients with different comorbidities are at higher risk of contracting the COVID19 virus and have a worse prognosis for the virus as well as for their comorbidities Further investigations of the interaction between smoking and COVID19 are warranted to accurately assess the risk of contracting COVID19 among smokers, and the progression to mechanical ventilation or death in patients who suffer from it,Background Hypercoagulation is one of the striking features of COVID19 Patients hospitalized with COVID19 are at high risk for venous thromboembolism However, it is unknown if the risk for venous thromboembolism persists after discharge Case Summary We report a case with pulmonary embolism 5u2009months after COVID19 No risk factors for venous thrombosis have been identified Conclusion In COVID19 related hospitalization, large studies are needed to identify the risk of venous thromboembolism after discharge,BACKGROUND During the coronavirus disease2019 COVID19 pandemic outbreak our blood bank developed protocols to guarantee accurate blood components to COVID19 patients OBJECTIVES To provide convalescent whole blood donor screening strategies for patients recovering from COVID19 METHODS We recruited COVID19 recovering patients who met our defined inclusion criteria for whole blood donation All blood units were screened for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 SARSCoV2 RNA by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction RTPCR and SARSCOV2 immunoglobulin G IgG antibodies against the S1 domain RESULTS We screened 180 blood units from patients recovering from COVID19 All results were negative for SARSCoV2 RNA and 872 were positive for SARSCOV2 IgG antibodies in the plasma CONCLUSIONS Blood component units from recovering COVID19 patients are safe Plasma units with positive IgG antibodies could serve as an efficient passive immunization for COVID19 patients Moreover, in the face of increased transfusion demand for treatment of anemia and coagulation dysfunction in critical ill COVID19 patients, red blood cells units and random platelets units from convalescent donors can be safely transfused,The SARSCoV2 COVID19 pandemic is a worldwide public health emergency with widespread impact on health care delivery Unforeseen challenges have been noted during administration of usual haematology care in these unusual COVID19 times Medical services have been overstretched and frontline health workers have borne the brunt of COVID19 pandemic Movement restrictions during lockdown prevented large sections of population from accessing health care, blood banks from holding blood drives, and disrupted delivery of diagnostic hematology services The disruption in hematology care due to COVID19 pandemic in India has been disproportionately higher compared to other subspecialities as hematology practice in India remains restricted to major cities In this review we chronicle the challenges encountered in caring for hematology patients during the COVID19 pandemic in India and put forth recommendations for minimizing their impact on provision of hematology care with special emphasis on hematology practice in lower and middle income countries LMICs,El síndrome respiratorio agudo severo coronavirus 2 SARSCOV2 descrito en Wuhan, China a finales del 2019, ha causado más de 9 millones de infecciones en el mundo, y más de 480 mil muertes En Panamá se han reportado más de 28 mil casos, y más de 500 muertes por COVID19 Se ha observado un alto riesgo de complicaciones trombóticas, probablemente como consecuencia del daño vascular asociado con la infección viral y la inflamación severa, con la contribución patógena de las plaquetas que interactúan con la pared vascular y los leucocitos Describimos 3 casos de pacientes hospitalizados en un hospital general en la provincia de Panamá, República de Panamá Dos hombres y una mujer, edad promedio 406 años, estadía hospitalaria promedio de 353 días ingresados con diagnóstico de neumonía por SARSCOV2, niveles elevados de dimero D  5 ugmL, riesgo bajo calculado para embolia pulmonar Encontrando embolia pulmonar aguda en las ANGIO tomografía y en un caso acompañado de trombosis venosa profunda Todos recibían dosis profiláctica de heparina de bajo peso molecular Se necesitan algoritmos para identificar a aquellos susceptibles de desarrollar complicaciones trombóticas y enfermedades graves, determinar el papel de los biomarcadores y sistemas de puntuación para estratificar el riesgoAbstractThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCOV2 described in Wuhan, China in late 2019, has caused more than 9 million infections worldwide, and more than 480 thousand deaths In Panama, more than 28 thousand cases have been reported, and more than 500 deaths from COVID19 A high risk of thrombotic complications has been observed, probably as a consequence of vascular damage associated with viral infection and severe inflammation, with the pathogenic contribution of platelets that interact with the vascular wall and leukocytes We describe 3 cases of patients hospitalized in a general hospital in the province of Panama, Republic of Panama Two men and one woman, average age 406 years, average hospital stay of 353 days admitted with a diagnosis of SARSVOC2 pneumonia, elevated levels of dimer D  5 ug  mL, calculated low risk for pulmonary embolism Finding acute pulmonary embolism on ANGIO tomography and in one case accompanied by deep vein thrombosis All received prophylactic doses of low molecular weight heparin Algorithms are needed to identify those susceptible to developing thrombotic complications and serious diseases, determine the role of biomarkers and scoring systems to stratify risk,Environmental air pollution is a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality worldwide Environmental air pollution has a direct impact on human health, being responsible for an increase in the incidence of and number of deaths due to cardiopulmonary, neoplastic, and metabolic diseases it also contributes to global warming and the consequent climate change associated with extreme events and environmental imbalances In this review, we present articles that show the impact that exposure to different sources and types of air pollutants has on the respiratory system we present the acute effectssuch as increases in symptoms and in the number of emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and deathsand the chronic effectssuch as increases in the incidence of asthma, COPD, and lung cancer, as well as a rapid decline in lung function The effects of air pollution in more susceptible populations and the effects associated with physical exercise in polluted environments are also presented and discussed Finally, we present the major studies on the subject conducted in Brazil Health care and disease prevention services should be aware of this important risk factor in order to counsel more susceptible individuals about protective measures that can facilitate their treatment, as well as promoting the adoption of environmental measures that contribute to the reduction of such emissions,BACKGROUND Cardiac transplant is an effective longterm management option for several severe cardiac diseases These cardiac transplant patients may present to the emergency department with a range of issues involving the cardiac transplantation, including complications due to their transplant as well as altered presentations of disease resulting from their transplant OBJECTIVE This narrative review provides a focused guide to the evaluation and management of patients with cardiac transplantation and its complications DISCUSSION Cardiac transplant is an effective therapy for endstage heart failure A transplanted heart varies both anatomically and physiologically from a native heart Several significant complications may occur Graft failure, rejection, and infection are common causes of morbidity and mortality within the first year of transplant As these patients are on significant immunosuppressive medication regimens, they are at risk of infection, but inadequate immunosuppression increases the risk of acute rejection A variety of dysrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation and ventricular dysrhythmias may occur These patients are also at risk of acute coronary syndrome, cardiac allograft vasculopathy, and medication adverse events Importantly, patients with acute coronary syndrome can have an altered presentation with the socalled painless myocardial infarction Consultation with the transplant physician is recommended, if available, for these patients to assist in evaluation and management CONCLUSIONS An understanding of the presentations and various complications that may affect patients with cardiac transplant will assist emergency clinicians in the care of these patients,What started as a small cluster of viral pneumonia like cases in a province of China, in the early weeks of December, has blown out to be a fullfledged pandemic virtually affecting every continent PubMed and Google search engines were used for literature search The case fatality rate which is around 26 for corona virus disease COVID19 patients rise to nearly 106 in COVID19 patients with prior cardio vascular disease Common cardiac manifestations include heart failure and myocardial damage Angiotensin converting enzyme ACE2 plays an important part in the pathophysiology of heart function in hypertension and diabetes, two of the most common manifestations of heart failure and is the cellular entry point for the severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS virus Patients with cardio vascular disease are believed to have increased secretion of ACE2 compared to healthy individuals and thus are at higher risk Patients on medications with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ACEi angiotensin receptor blocker ARB have increased ACE2 levels and may be at an increased risk, however there is no statistically significant data to substantiate this claim,INTRODUCTION Coronavirus COVID19 pandemic is current ongoing pandemic in world since its outbreak in Wuhan China in December 2019 It has affected 788 million people with 17 million deaths worldwide till date 23rd December 2020 To evaluate spectrum of HRCT AIMS Chest uf001ndings in patients infected with SARSCoV2 ie COVID19 HRCT were done in MATERIAL AND METHODS 242 patients with SARSCoV2 RTPCR positive status admitted in our COVID CARE CENTRE HRCT is useful in assessment of severity of COVID19 infection and subsequent plan for the treatment HRCT of the chest obtains thinslice chest images and process in a highspatialfrequency reconstruction algorithm This technique obtains images with exquisite lung detail, which are ideal for the assessment of diffuse lung diseases RESULTS Ground glass opaciuf001cation is predominant uf001nding present in majority of cases of COVID19 Other common uf001ndings include crazy paving pattern, consolidation, vascular dilation and subpleural linear opacities These uf001ndings can aid in early diagnosis of COVID19 ABBREVIATIONS HRCT Highresolution computed tomography, COVID19Coronavirus disease19, SARSCoV2severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, GGO ground glass opaciuf001cation, ARDS acute respiratory distress syndrome, RTPCR reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction, DIC disseminated intravascular coagulation, DVT deep vein thrombosis,Introduction An increasing number of children with severe coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is being reported, yet the spectrum of disease severity and expression patterns of angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2 in children at different developmental stages are largely unknow Methods We analysed clinical features in a cohort of 173 children with COVID19 015 yrsold between January 22, 2020 and March 15, 2020 We systematically examined the expression and distribution of ACE2 in different developmental stages of children by using a combination of childrens lung biopsies, pluripotent stem cellderived lung cells, RNAsequencing profiles, and ex vivo SARSCoV2 pseudoviral infections Results It revealed that infants  1yrsold, with a weaker potency of immune response, are more vulnerable to develop pneumonia whereas older children  1 yrsold are more resistant to lung injury The expression levels of ACE2 however do not vary by age in childrens lung ACE2 is notably expressed not only in Alveolar Type II AT II cells, but also in SOX9 positive lung progenitor cells detected in both pluripotent stem cell derivatives and infants lungs The ACE2SOX9 cells are readily infected by SARSCoV2 pseudovirus and the numbers of the double positive cells are significantly decreased in older children Conclusions Infants  1 yrsold with SARSCoV2 infection are more vulnerable to lung injuries ACE2 expression in multiple types of lung cells including SOX9 positive progenitor cells, in cooperation with an unestablished immune system, could be risk factors contributing to vulnerability of infants with COVID19 There is a need to continue monitoring lung development in young children who have recovered from SARSCoV2 infection,Saliva has been proposed as an alternative to upper airway swabs when testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 Although some studies have suggested higher viral loads and clinical sensitivity when testing saliva, studies have been relatively small and have given rise to contradictory results To better understand the relative performance characteristics of saliva and upper airway samples, I performed a rapid systematic review registered on PROSPERO as CRD42020205035, focusing on studies that included at least 20 subjects who provided diagnostic saliva and upper airway samples on the same day, which were tested by nucleic acid amplification methods and for which a confusion matrix could be constructed for based on a composite reference standard Nineteen studies comprising 21 cohorts that met predetermined acceptance criteria were identified following a search of PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv Seven of these cohorts were incorporated into a metaanalysis using a random effects model, which suggests that nasopharyngeal swabs are somewhat more sensitive than saliva samples for the diagnosis of early disease in ambulatory patients, such as in drivethrough centers or community health centers Nevertheless, the difference is modest, and the reduced need for personal protective equipment for saliva sampling may justify the difference Conclusions are limited by the significant heterogeneity of disease prevalence in the study populations and variation in the approaches to saliva sample collection,Background The relationship between diastolic dysfunction DD and outcome after CRT is debated The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of DD in predicting allcause mortality in heart failure patients undergoing CRT Methods Onehundred ninetythree patients age 6711 years, QRS width 16721ms, LVEF 288 were included in this multicentre prospective study Mitral filling pattern, mitral tissue Doppler velocity, tricuspid regurgitation velocity, and indexed left atrial volume were used to classify DD from grade I to III according to the 2016 recommendations of the American Society of EchocardiographyEuropean Association of Cardiovascular Imaging A reduction of LV endsystolic volume 15 at 6month followup FU identified CRTresponders and was observed in 132 68 patients Results During a median 35 months FU, 29 15 patients died Through multivariable analysis, coronary artery disease HR 221 100489 P 005, NYHA HR 292 145587, P 0003 and grade I DD HR 034 013089 were shown to be independent predictors of prognosis Table 1 Grade I DD was associated with a longer survival rate in both responders and nonresponders Fig 1 Nonresponders with grade IIIII DD had the worse outcome HR 125 3564404, P 00001 Conclusion Better diastolic function at baseline is associated with improved survival after CRT implantation, independently of CRTresponse,Background The initial enthusiasm for thrombectomy during percutaneous coronary intervention PCI of STelevation myocardial infarction STEMI patients has given way to restraint There has been some limited interest whether it is beneficial in some selected subgroups Hence, we performed a network metaanalysis to compare conventional PCI cPCI, Aspiration or manual thrombectomy AT and Mechanical thrombectomy McT for clarification Methods Electronic databases were searched for randomized studies that compared AT, McT, or cPCI A network metaanalysis was performed and odds ratio OR with 95 confidence intervals was generated for major adverse cardiac events MACE, mortality, myocardial infarction MI, target vessel revascularization TVR, stent thrombosis ST, stroke, left ventricular ejection fraction LVEF, myocardial blush grade MBG and ST segment resolution STR Results A total of 43 randomized trials n26,682 were included The risk of MACE OR 086 95 CI 073100, Mortality OR 085 95 CI 073099, MI OR 065, 95 CI 044095 and TVR OR 086, 95 CI 074100 were lower with AT compared to cPCI The risk of ST and strokewas no different with the use of adjunctive AT MBG, STR, and LVEF improved with the use of AT while the infarct size was nodifferent in the two groups Conclusions Our comprehensive network metaanalysis suggests conflicting outcomes with AT While Mortality, MACE, MI seem better, there is a suggestion that, Stroke and ST might be worse Whether AT can still be pursued in any select cases should be further scrutinized,SUMMARY The coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic considerably affects health, wellbeing, social, economic and other aspects of daily life The impact of COVID19 on blood pressure BP control and hypertension remains insufficiently explored We therefore provide a comprehensive review of the potential changes in lifestyle factors and behaviours as well as environmental changes likely to influence BP control and cardiovascular risk during the pandemic This includes the impact on physical activity, dietary patterns, alcohol consumption and the resulting consequences, for example increases in body weight Other risk factors for increases in BP and cardiovascular risk such as smoking, emotionalpsychologic stress, changes in sleep patterns and diurnal rhythms may also exhibit significant changes in addition to novel factors such as air pollution and environmental noise We also highlight potential preventive measures to improve BP control because hypertension is the leading preventable risk factor for worldwide health during and beyond the COVID19 pandemic,Abstract  Background The Coronavirus disease2019 COVID19 has been responsible for the death of over 400,000 people with a continuous rise in prevalence and mortality globally Identifying hospitalized patients at high mortality risk is critical for triage and healthcare resource management regionally, nationally, and globally We present a retrospective analysis of predictors of mortality in hospitalized COVID19 patients   Methods Electronic health records EHR of patients admitted between March 1 and April 18, 2020 to St Lukes University Hospital with a primary diagnosis of COVID19 were reviewed for medical comorbidities and initial biochemicalinflammatory markers Survivors vs nonsurvivors were compared using χ 2 test, Students ttest, and MannWhitney Utest as appropriate Univariate logistic regression was used to identify candidate variables for multivariate analysis, which were then included in stepwise backward logistic regression Statistical analyses were done on SPSS v26 software IBM, Armonk, NY   Results Clinical characteristics, biochemical abnormalities and results of univariate regression in our cohort of 560 patients are noted in table 1 Multivariate regression revealed age, congestive heart failure CHF, and creatinine 15 mgdl as significant predictors of mortality while race Caucasian, vascular disease, lymphopenia, and elevated ferritin approached significance Table 2 Table 1 Baseline clinical characteristics, overall and by mortality Continuous variables are presented as median 25th75th percentile, and categorical variables as n  Significance of difference between subgroups survivors versus nonsurvivors p005, p001, p0001  Table 2 Results of stepwise backward conditional logistic regression for predicting mortality among hospitalized COVID19 patients n334, 287 survivors and 47 nonsurvivors ALC  Absolute lymphocyte count, SE  Standard error of B    Conclusion We present one of the largest cohorts to date of hospitalized COVID19 patients Age, CHF, and renal disease were significant independent predictors of mortality Though several inflammatory markers ddimer, CRP, procalcitonin initially predicted mortality, they failed in multivariate analysis, questioning their role in riskstratifying COVID19 hospitalized patients Interestingly, IL6 used in those severely ill patients to assess candidacy for IL6 inhibitor therapy Tocilizumab failed to predict mortality in our study Our analysis was limited due to its retrospective nature and unfortunately large amounts of data were missing for some variables ESR, BNP, IL6 levels The missing data was due to rapidly evolving institutional protocols early during the pandemic, leading to nonuniform assessment of these markers   Disclosures All Authors No reported disclosures,Vitamin D is customarily involved in maintaining bone and calcium homeostasis However, contemporary studies have identified the implication of vitamin D in several cellular processes including cellular proliferation, differentiation, wound healing, repair and regulatory systems inclusive of host defence, immunity, and inflammation Multiple studies have indicated corelations between low serum levels of vitamin D, perturbed pulmonary functions and enhanced incidences of inflammatory diseases Almost all of the pulmonary diseases including acute lung injury, cystic fibrosis, asthma, COPD, Pneumonia and Tuberculosis, all are inflammatory in nature Studies have displayed strong interrelations with vitamin D deficiency and progression of lung disorders however, the underlying mechanism is still unknown Vitamin D has emerged to possess inhibiting effects on pulmonary inflammation while exaggerating innate immune defenses by strongly influencing functions of inflammatory cells including dendritic cells, monocytemacrophages, T cells, and B cells along with structural epithelial cells This review dissects the effects of vitamin D on the inflammatory cells and their therapeutic relevance in pulmonary diseases Although, the data obtained is very limited and needs further corroboration but presents an exciting area of further research This is because of its ease of supplementation and development of personalized medicine which could lead us to an effective adjunct and costeffective method of therapeutic modality for highly fatal pulmonary diseases,During COVID19 pandemic Lung ultrasound has rapidly become a tool for diagnosis and monitoring of lung involvement and its severity Accurate evaluation of lung pathologic entities at the bedside, especially in critically ill patients, and those on mechanical ventilation, remains problematic CT should not be frequently repeated and is not available everywhere, especially for critically ill patients Limitations of bedside chest Xray have been well described and lead to poorquality Xray films with low sensitivityThe lung ultrasound has been shown to be a useful tool in intensive care patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome ARDS and can be used forassessing severity of lung involvement in COVID19 In this paper the accuracy of bedside LUS, chest Xray and computer tomography are compared based on clinical cases, typical for COVID19 lung ultrasound appearance is evaluated There have been shown that lung ultrasound can predict the deterioration of the patients conditionand can be used for risk stratification and clinical decision making, reducethe use of both chest x‐rays and computer tomography, what is very important especially in limited resources settings,Abstract  Background Endemic coronaviruses EC NL63, 229E, OC43, HKU1 have been identified in humans since the 1960s Most are associated with mild upper respiratory tract infections RTIs but can be associated serious disease More recently, novel coronaviruses associated with SARS, MERS, and COVID19 caused by SARSCoV2 have emerged and are often associated with serious disease and death With this report, we compare presenting clinical characteristics and some outcomes of patients hospitalized with RTIs caused by ECs or by SARSCoV2 COVID19   Methods Patients admitted to the Summa Health System with RTIs associated with EC were identified via multiplex PCR method BioFire™ Patients admitted with COVID19 were identified by realtime, reverse transcriptasePCR method using one of several platforms Patients were selected from two existing quality improvement registries encompassing EC and COVID19 cases We compared clinical characteristics and outcomes of EC patients to those of COVID19 patients using chisquared tests for proportions and independent samples ttests for means   Results Shown in Table 1 Significant differences in patient characteristics with EC vs COVID19 included older age, primarily Caucasian, smoking history, requiring O2 supplementation on admission, and having chronic heart, lung, or renal disease Significant differences in patient characteristics with COVID19 vs EC included admission from extended care facility, obesity, presenting with fever, gastrointestinal symptoms andor myalgia, presence of radiographic infiltrates, abnormal liver tests, and longer length of stay LOS A nonsignificant difference was noted in 30 day mortality rates Coronavirus OC43 accounted for 54 of EC strains    Conclusion There were significant differences in clinical characteristics between the two groups with EC patients more likely to have lung disease often COPD and requiring admission for need of O2 supplementation COVID19 patients were more likely to present with a febrile illness associated with pneumonia and require longer LOS often requiring O2 supplementation later in hospitalization Patients admitted with COVID19 present with different clinical characteristics than those with EC with numerically higher mortality rate   Disclosures All

troponin I cTnI can suggest either a coconcurrent myocarditis or acute myocardial infarction Understanding how laboratory values predict disease severity is important for clinicians to guide therapy and triage patients   Methods A cross sectional study was performed utilizing the 184 hospital United States database of HCA Patients were selected based on inpatient visits to HCA facilities from February 2020 to May 2020 with a COVID19 diagnosis and at least one cTnI lab test Patients were divided according to an elevated or normal cTnI value based on the 99th percentile reference range of the test Outcomes, such as length of stay, disposition, and time on the ventilator, were compared   Results 3968 patients hospitalized with COVID19 were identified Of those, 3158 patients had at least one cTnI test throughout their hospitalization 829 26 had at least one positive cTnI during their hospitalization Patients with at least one positive cTnI were hospitalized on average for 87 days, whereas patients without positive cTnI were hospitalized on average for 63 days p 00001 1499 patients without positive cTnI were sent home without health care, but only 196 with positive cTnI were discharged home without requiring home health p  00001 Need for mechanical ventilation was also higher in the elevated cTnI group If intubated, patients in both groups required on average the same amount of ventilator time, 7 days p  07263 Ventilation time between COVID19 patients with and without elevated Troponins  Length of hospitalization stay between COVID19 patient with and without elevated Troponins  Differences in discharge between COVID19 patients with and without elevated Troponins    Conclusion Patients with at least one positive cTnI during their hospitalization had increased length of stay and decreased likelihood of being discharged home without home health Using a large nationwide database we confirmed previously published findings in smaller patient populations associating cardiovascular disease with COVID19 severity Once patients were intubated, both subsets of patients with and without elevated cTnI had similar days on the ventilator, suggesting the COVID19 acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS has a more complicated relationship to troponin levels These findings suggest that patients with an increased cTnI should be triaged to receive aggressive management   Disclosures All Authors No reported disclosures,Ventricular Assist Devices VAD serves as an advanced treatment modality for end stage systolic heart failure patients Implantation of VAD requires a multidisciplinary team approach with in depth family meetings and education sessions to ensure a successful outcome During the COVID19 pandemic, multiple new barriers were identified to allow for traditional VAD implantation and postoperative care,People over the age of 65 and those suffering from chronic diseases, such as asthma, are part of the risk group for severe acute respiratory syndromeCOV2 SARSCoV2 infection In the past, a connection between viral infections and asthma has been presented Patients with asthma appear to be at risk of contracting viral infections, and also viruses can cause asthma exacerbations Another concern during this period was about the chronic administration of corticosteroids in asthmatic patients, because of the consideration that corticosteroid therapy would decrease the immunity of these patients, thus increasing the risk of infections, including the infection with SARSCoV2 Thus, several questions have emerged about the role of corticosteroid therapy in the development of COVID19 in patients undergoing corticosteroid treatment Most guidelines recommend continuing the administration of chronic treatment to this category of patients At the same time, the health system had to adapt to the situation caused by the COVID19 pandemic and deviate from the standard methods of managing most chronic diseases and these changes had an impact on these category of patients,According to a number of studies, patients with cardiovascular diseases CVD have an increased risk of adverse course and death from COVID19 The deficiency in the daily consumption of micronutrients, especially potassium and magnesium, is considered to be a noninfectious epidemic of the 21st century The paper presents the results of studies indicating an increased risk of developing CVD arterial hypertension, ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, arrhythmias and mortality from them in the presence of a deficiency in the consumption of potassium and magnesium, as well as their reduced content in the body It provides an overview of published data on the importance of maintaining normal levels of potassium and magnesium in the body to reduce CVD risk and mortality,This book reviews the basics of pulmonary functional imaging using new CT and MR techniques and describes the clinical applications of these techniques in detail The intention is to equip readers with a full understanding of pulmonary functional imaging that will allow optimal application of all relevant techniques in the assessment of a variety of diseases, including COPD, asthma, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary thromboembolism, pulmonary hypertension, lung cancer and pulmonary nodule Pulmonary functional imaging has been promoted as a research and diagnostic tool that has the capability to overcome the limitations of morphological assessments as well as functional evaluation based on traditional nuclear medicine studies The recent advances in CT and MRI and in medical image processing and analysis have given further impetus to pulmonary functional imaging and provide the basis for future expansion of its use in clinical applications In documenting the utility of stateoftheart pulmonary functional imaging in diagnostic radiology and pulmonary medicine, this book will be of high value for chest radiologists, pulmonologists, pulmonary surgeons, and radiation technologists,Abstract  Background Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 infection can lead to many different cardiovascular complications, we were interested in studying prognostic markers in patients with atrial fibrillationflutter A FibFlutter   Methods A retrospective cohort study of patients with confirmed COVID19 and either with existing or new onset A FibFlutter who were admitted to our hospital between March 15 and May 20, 2020 Demographic, outcome and laboratory data were extracted from the electronic medical record and compared between survivors and nonsurvivors Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were employed to identify the prognostic markers associated with mortality in patients with A FibFlutter   Results The total number of confirmed COVID19 patients during the study period was 350 37 of them had existing or new onset A FibFlutter Twenty one 57 expired, and 16 43 were discharged alive The median age was 72 years old, ranged from 19 to 100 years old Comorbidities were present in 33 89 patients, with hypertension 82 being the most common, followed by diabetes 46 and coronary artery disease 30 New onset of atrial fibrillation was identified in 23 patients 70, of whom 13 57 expired 29 patients 78 presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and 2 patients 5 with atrial flutter Mechanical ventilation was required for 8 patients, of whom 6 expired In univariate analysis, we found a significant difference in baseline ferritin p004, LDH p002, neutrophillymphocyte ratio NLR p005, neutrophilmonocyte ratio NMR p003 and platelet p0015 between survivors and nonsurvivors With multivariable logistic regression analysis, the only value that had an odds of survival was a low NLR odds ratio 074 95 confidence interval 053093   Conclusion This retrospective cohort study of hospitalized patients with COVID19 demonstrated an association of increase NLR as risk factors for death in COVID19 patients with A FibFlutter A high NLR has been associated with increased incidence, severity and risk for stroke in atrial fibrillation patients but to our knowledge, we are first to demonstrate the utilization in mortality predictions in COVID19 patients with A FibFlutter   Disclosures Jihad Slim, MD, Abbvie Speakers BureauGilead

care concerns in 2020 The continually growing number of new cases, the global outspread of the virus and the severity of the disease determined the World Health Organization to declare the outbreak a pandemic Twenty per cent of the patients present severe and critical forms that frequently require oxygen supplementation and intensive care unit admission That is why, to provide optimal care, it is imperative to identify atrisk patients Patients with associated chronic diseases are more prone to develop severe and critical forms of the infection Although the chronic pulmonary obstructive disease is present only in a limited number of coronavirus disease 2019 patients, it is most commonly associated with lung disease and a poor outcome than other comorbidities,Introduction COVID19 as a respiratory disease is the latest challenge in modern medicine As in most health problems, respiratory rehabilitation also finds application in this case Materials and methods Analysis of available literature, articles in the Google Scholar and PubMed database using keywords COVID19, respiratory physiotherapy, lung disease, prevention, therapy The available literature was subjectively selected, and then the latest version of each article was used Results There are many physiotherapeutic methods and techniques that can be applied in the fight against COVID19 disease, but there is still a lack of scientific research that would confirm their effectiveness in this particular disease entity Rehabilitation of sick people, both in severe and moderate condition, should be based on airway clearance, respiratory control and adequate physical activity Conclusions The issue of rehabilitation in COVID19 disease requires further interest of researchers because there is still insufficient literature on this subject Undeniably physiotherapy should be a significant part of the interdisciplinary approach to fight this disease entity, because the effects of its absence can significantly affect the health of patients,Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis IPA caused by Aspergillus fumigatus is a lifethreatening lung disease of immunocompromised patients Diagnosis currently relies on nonspecific chest CT, culture of the fungus from invasive lung biopsy, and detection of the cell wall carbohydrate galactomannan GM in serum or in BAL fluids recovered during invasive bronchoscopy Urine provides an ideal bodily fluid for the noninvasive detection of pathogen biomarkers, with current urinebased immunodiagnostics for IPA focused on GM Surrogate protein biomarkers might serve to improve disease detection Here, we report the development of a monoclonal antibody mAb, PD7, which is specific to A fumigatus and related species in the section Fumigati, and which binds to its 18 kDa ribotoxin Asp f I Using PD7, we show that the protein is secreted during hyphal development, and so represents an ideal candidate for detecting invasive growth We have developed a lateralflow device AfuLFD incorporating the mAb which has a limit of detection of 15 ng Asp f ImL urine Preliminary evidence of the tests diagnostic potential is demonstrated with urine from a patient with acute lymphoid leukaemia with probable IPA The AfuLFD therefore provides a potential novel opportunity for noninvasive urinebased detection of IPA caused by A fumigatus,The authors present the case of a 27yearold patient with cardiovascular complications after undergoing severe acute respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus 2 infection The first symptoms included muscle aches and somnolence, severe sore throat, and enlargement of submandibular and cervical lymph nodes, followed by dyspnoea and chest pain with body temperature 375°C Because of the medical profession, the patient underwent a routine reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction test for coronavirus infection, which was positive, before returning to work In an electrocardiogram, it was observed pathological Q waves in II, III, aVF, V6, and 1 mm of ST elevation in V1V3 The laboratory tests showed normal levels of cardiac troponin T, creatine kinase MB fraction, and Nterminal proBtype natriuretic peptide Transthoracic echocardiography revealed the hypokinesis of the middle and apical segment of the anterior and lateral wall with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction LVEF — 54 The magnetic resonance imaging MRI revealed the normal volume and global left ventricular systolic function LVEF 52 with segmental wall motion abnormalities Subepicardial banded foci of late gadolinium enhancement LGE, located in the lower right and left ventricular segments of the basal, central and apical segments of the inferior wall suggested inflammatory aetiology of changes found It may be assumed that the suspected myocarditis was caused by coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 infection Since LGE was present in the inferior wall, the patient may be considered having a low risk of major cardiac events and heart failure hospitalizations, referring to the ITAMY study In patients without a history of cardiovascular diseases with COVID19, cardiac MRI may reveal preserved, midrange, or reduced LVEF The patient requires further followup The coronavirus is the most dangerous for the elderly, but it can also affect the hearts of otherwise healthy people, including young adolescents,Background Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2xa0 is recognized as the main cellular receptor for the new coronavirus, SARSCoV2, that facilitates its entry into the host target cell, leading to the fatal viral infection, coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 Thus, it is considered as a main therapeutic target in the SARSCoV2 infection The dual role of ACE2 as a gate for SARSCoV2 virus and asxa0a part of lung and multiorgan protection has built a scientific debate that affects the choice of treatments used against COVID19 patient ACE2 inhibitors like antiACE2 antibodies were first introduced as therapeutic solutions that, theoretically, would decrease the availability of target molecules for SARSCoV2 by downregulating ACE2 expression However, animal studies showed that ACE2 upregulation acts as a counterbalance to the hypertensive proinflammatory angiotensin Iconverting enzyme ACE in the reninangiotensin system RAS and results in a protective role against acute lung injury  a fatal consequence of the disease The current study tests the effect of ACE2activating treatments against the outcome of genetic variations in the population that have ACE2upregulatory effects Conclusionxa0xa0Despite its role as a receptor for the SARSCoV2 virus, experimental studies and the genetic polymorphisms in populations that have ACE2 upregulation revealed a protective role against COVID19 infection xa0 Key words ACE2 xa0xa0ACE xa0COVID19xa0 treatmentsxa0 genetic variations,Abstract  Background Patient with COVID19 may exhibit a wide array of neurologic manifestations, including stroke in some cases, stroke is the presenting or predominant manifestation The frequency of stroke in COVID19 has varied greatly in previous reports, probably reflecting the intensity with which neurologic abnormalities have been sought The great majority of stroke have been thought to be ischemic   Methods Review of data, case reports, and case series   Results See table 1 for a summary of reported data on neurologic manifestations of COVID19 When MRI has been done, the great majority of strokes have been shown to be ischemic COVID19 causes a generalized hypercoagulable state, and arterial thromboses have been recognized in other organs, as well, involving pulmonary, mesenteric and coronary arteries Coronavirus infection causes an intense release of cytokines with widespread activation of the coagulation cascade In addition, SARSCoV2 attaches to ACE 2 receptors on endothelial surfaces via the S spike protein and invades causing a localized inflammatory response, with a resulting increase in local thrombotic activity Antiphospholipid antibodies are sometimes present New data suggest possible role of alphadefensin level in creation and prevention of disintegration of blood clots To date, reports of neurologic disease are based on case series, so there is no way, at present, to calculate the frequency of neurologic complications of COVID19 A systematic, prospective study focusing on neurologic examination supplemented by MRI in hospitalized patients would answer the question of the incidence of this complication, but logistical problems including patients need for ICU care and concern for contagion resulting from sending patents out of the ICU for procedures mitigate against the likelihood of such a study being done   Conclusion We hypothesize that 1 stroke occurs in COVID19 more frequently than is recognized 2 a hypercoagulable state with inflammation at the site of local invasion of vascular endothelial cells by SARSCoV2, perhaps with a role for antiphospolipid antibodies all contribute to the pathogenesis of stroke and 3 more liberal use of anticoagulation in COVID19 cases should be considered   Disclosures All Authors No reported disclosures,The coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 has caused a global pandemic The worsening of COVID19 is caused by viral pneumonia, but the disease also remarkably affects the cardiovascular system,Introduction SARSCoV2, responsible for the current global pandemic, could predispose to a hypercoagulable state Venous thrombosis is more frequent in COVID19 associated coagulopathy than in bacterial sepsisinduced coagulopathy Also, COVID19 induces and hypercoagulation state that overlaps with a hemophagocytic syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome, and thrombotic microangiopathy It is not uncommon that patients with severe COVID19 consult in the emergency department with embolisms that may result in life risk,OBJECTIVES We sought to evaluate the safety, efficacy and feasibility of sameday discharge after uncomplicated, minimalist TAVR BACKGROUND At the start of the COVID19 pandemic, we created a sameday discharge SDD pathway after conscious sedation, transfemoral minimalist TAVR to help minimize risk of viral transmission and conserve hospital resources Studies support that nextday discharge NDD for carefully selected patients following minimalist TAVR is safe and feasible There is a paucity of data regarding the safety of SDD after TAVR METHODS Inhospital and 30u2009day outcomes of consecutive patients meeting prespecified criteria for SDD after minimalist TAVR at our institution between March and July of 2020 were reviewed Outcomes were compared to a NDD cohort from July 2018 through July 2020 that would have met SDD criteria Primary endpoints were mortality, delayed pacemaker placement, stroke and cardiovascular readmission at 30u2009days RESULTS Twenty nine patients were discharged via the SDD pathway after TAVR 128 prior NDD patients were identified who met all criteria for SDD The STS scores were similar between the two groups SDD 26 15 vs NDD 23u2009u200912 There were no deaths at 30u2009days in either group There was no significant difference in delayed pacemaker placement SDD 0 vs NDD 08, pu2009u200999 or cardiovascular readmission SDD 0 vs NDD 55, p  35 at 30u2009days CONCLUSIONS Same day discharge following uncomplicated, minimalist TAVR in selected patients appears to be safe, achieving similar 30u2009day outcomes as a cohort of next day discharge patients,,,,The 2019 coronavirus disease COVID19 pandemic is currently a challenge worldwide Due to the characteristics of lung function tests, the risk of cross infection may be high between health care workers and patients The role of lung function testing is well defined for the diagnosis of various diseases and conditions Lung function tests are also indispensable in evaluating the response to medical treatment, in monitoring patient respiratory and systemic pathologies, and in evaluating preoperative risk in cardiothoracic and major abdominal surgeries However, lung function testing represents a potential route for COVID19 transmission, due to the aerosol generated during the procedures and the concentration of patients with pulmonary diseases in lung function laboratories Currently, the opportunities for COVID19 transmission remain partially unknown, and data are continuously evolving This review provides useful information on the risks and recommendations for lung function testing, which have varied according to the phase of the pandemic This information may support national and regional boards and the health authorities to which they belong There is a need for rapid reopening of lung function laboratories, but maximum safety is required in the COVID19 era,COVID19 has been described as the cause for a proinflammatory and hypercoagulable state that induces thrombotic vascular lesions and, in more severe cases, disseminated intravascular coagulation Increased values of ddimers are related to the severity of the disease and are associated with worst prognosis Intensive care studies reported an increased risk of pulmonary embolism and venous thrombosis diseases in COVID19 compared with the historical control group even in patients who underwent the lowmolecularweight heparin LWMH prophylaxis Patients with COVID19 who have a stable clinical condition do not require hospitalisation and are treated at home with symptomatic therapy LWMH is reserved for those with reduced mobility In this case report, we describe a COVID19 patient with pulmonary artery thrombosis treated at home,As of 10 December, 82,127 citations were found in PubMed on COVID19 and 5285 when COVID19 and cardiovascular disease were used as search words Many cardiovascular societies have also released statements regarding COVID19 What have we learned from this incredible scientific excitement,We recently showed that IgG anticardiolipin autoantibodies aCL are highly and independently associated with COVID19 severity 1 This result is essential for the management of the risk of thrombosis, which is well established today in COVID19 2 In their study, Frapard et al 3 also outlined the prothrombotic state of COVID19 patients, especially on those with Acute Respiratory Disease Syndrome ARDS,Patients with sickle cell disease and COVID19 may not have a more dire outcome than the general population Nevertheless, they may present with acute chest syndrome and other sickle cell crises which should be aggressively managed,SARSCOV2 has created one of the most massive pandemics in modern history There is a rapid accumulation of data on its epidemiology, clinical course, diagnosis, management, and complications One of the sequelae of COVID19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS is pulmonary fibrosis There is a dearth of accurate data on the prevalence of pulmonary fibrosis postCOVID19 We report a patient who developed dyspnea secondary to pulmonary fibrosis after successful treatment of COVID19 pneumonia,Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 has been demonstrated to be the cause of emerging atypical pneumonia In patients with tracheostomy, coronavirus hypothetically coexists with wellknown bacterial agents A 61yearold male patient with tracheostomy was admitted to the hospital with dyspnea, fever and increased tracheal secretions Laboratory findings revealed lymphopenia and elevated Creactive protein and procalcitonin levels Chest computed tomography showed consolidation areas and groundglass opacities more prominent in subpleural areas Although two consecutive RTPCR analyses of combined nasopharengealoropharengeal swabs were found to be negative for SARSCoV2 RNA, positivity was reported for endotracheal aspirate ETA sample Significant growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was detected in the bacterial culture of ETA sample In conclusion, clinical samples for SARSCoV2 should be obtained through the lower respiratory tract, if possible and if upper airway samples are negative To the best our knowledge, our paper is the first report of the patient with tracheostomy who was treated successfully for COVID19,Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is primarily a pulmonary disease, but also affects the cardiovascular system in multiple ways In this review, we will summarise and put into perspective findings and debates relating to the diverse aspects of cardiovascular involvement of COVID19 We will review evidence for the role of the reninangiotensinaldosterone system RAAS, the risk of preexisting cardiovascular disease in COVID19 susceptibility and course, and the mechanism of acute and longterm myocardial injury The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 SARSCoV2 uses membranebound angiotensin convertingenzyme2 ACE2 as a receptor for cell entry ACE2 is part of an important counterregulatory circuit antagonising the harmful effects of angiotensin II on lung and heart Modulation of ACE2 may therefore affect disease susceptibility and disease course However, observational clinical studies and one randomised trial have so far not yielded evidence for harmful or beneficial effects of blockers of the RAAS during COVID19 Age, gender, and multimorbidity all increase susceptibility to SARSCoV2 In contrast, preexisting cardiovascular diseases do so only minimally, but they may aggravate the disease course Direct SARSCoV2 infection of the heart tissue and myocytes is rare Nevertheless, COVID19 may lead to myocarditislike acute cardiac injury, characterised by myocardial oedema, but lacking extensive myocyte loss and lymphocytic infiltration Independent of this, increases in cardiac biomarkers troponin, Nterminal probrain natriuretic peptide, Ddimer are frequent, especially in the phase of severe systemic inflammation and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and quantitatively associated with poor outcome The pulmonary infection may result initially in right ventricular dysfunction, but in cases with severe systemic infection hypoxia, hyperinflammation and cytokine storm heart failure may eventually ensue Unlike other infections and inflammatory states, COVID19 does not appear to trigger acute coronary syndromes In children, even mild COVID19 can induce a multisystem inflammatory syndrome with Kawasakilike symptoms frequently accompanied by cardiogenic shock,A 25yearold man presented to the emergency department with acuteonset chest pain and shortness of breath A physical examination revealed coarse crackles in the both lower lungs Consolidation and groundglass opacities suggesting viral infection were detected in the right lower lobe on chest computed tomography Laboratory findings revealed elevated troponin, leukocytosis, and lymphopenia Electrocardiography revealed ST segment elevation with PR depression in leads I, aVL, V5, and V6, and ST depression and PR elevation in aVR Echocardiography revealed diffuse cardiac hypokinesia and a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction Suspecting coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19related myopericarditis, the patient was hospitalized After one week of empirical antibiotics, antivirals, and supportive therapy, his condition improved Antibody testing for COVID19 was positive on hospitalization day 8 The presentation of myopericarditis can be vague and mislead physicians during the COVID19 pandemic Myopericarditis should be included as a differential diagnosis for patients with suspected COVID19,BACKGROUND Continuous positive airway pressure CPAP ventilation may be used as a potential bridge to invasive mechanical ventilation IMV, or as a ceilingofcare for persistent hypoxaemia despite standard oxygen therapy, according to UK guidelines We examined the association of mode of respiratory support and ceilingofcare on mortality METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of routinely collected deidentified data of adults with nasalthroat SARsCoV2 swabpositive results, at the Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust between 10th March19th April 2020 outcomes determined on 22nd May FINDINGS Of 347 patients with SARsCoV2 swabpositive results, 294 847 patients admitted for Covid19 were included in the study Sixtynine patients were trialled on CPAP, mostly delivered by face mask, either as an early ceiling of care instituted within 24 hours of admission N  19, or as a potential bridge to IMV N  44 Patients receiving a ceiling of care more than 24 hours after admission N  6 were excluded from the analysis Two hundred and fifteen patients 731 maximally received airstandard oxygen therapy, and 45 153 patients maximally received CPAP Thirtyfour patients 116 required IMV, of which 24 had received prior CPAP There were 138 patients with an early ceilingofcare plan preadmissionwithin 24h Overall, 103350 patients died and 191650 were alive at study end Among all patients trialled on CPAP either as a potential bridge to IMV N  44 or as a ceilingofcare N  19 mortality was 25 and 84, respectively Overall, there was strong evidence for higher mortality among patients who required CPAP or IMV, compared to those who required only airoxygen aOR 524 95CI 138, 1981 and aOR 4647 95CI 752, 28708, respectively p0001, and among patients with early ceilingofcare compared to those without a ceiling aOR 4181 95CI 828, 21117 p0001 Among patients without a ceiling of care N  137, 10 patients required prompt intubation following failed oxygen therapy, but 44 patients received CPAP CPAP failure, defined as death N  1 or intubation N  24, occurred in 57 N  25 of patients But in total, 75 N  33 of those started on CPAP with no ceiling of care recovered to discharge19 without the need for IMV, and 14 following IMV CONCLUSION Our data suggest that among patients with no ceilingofcare, an initial trial of CPAP as a potential bridge to IMV offers a favourable therapeutic alternative to early intubation In contrast, among patients with a ceilingof care, CPAP seems to offer little additional survival benefit beyond oxygen therapy alone Information on ceilings of respiratory support is vital to interpreting mortality from Covid19 STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY Sample size relatively smallStudy sample representative of hospitalised Covid19 patients in UKPreviously unreported data on role of ceilingsofcare in hospitalised Covid19 patientsNovel data on use of CPAP separated by indication,The multimeric plasma glycoprotein von Willebrand factor VWF is best known for recruiting platelets to sites of injury during primary hemostasis Generally, mutations in the VWF gene lead to loss of hemostatic activity and thus the bleeding disorder von Willebrand Disease By employing cone and platelet aggregometry and microfluidic assays, we uncovered a platelet glycoprotein GPIIbIIIadependent prothrombotic gainoffunction GOF for variant pPro2555Arg, located in the C4domain, leading to an increase in platelet aggregate size We performed complementary biophysical and structural investigations using circular dichroism spectra, small angle Xray scattering, NMR spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations on the single C4domain and dimeric wildtype and pPro2555Arg constructs C4pPro2555Arg retained the overall structural conformation with minor populations of alternative conformations exhibiting increased hinge flexibility and slow conformational exchange The dimeric protein becomes disordered and more flexible Our data suggest that the GOF is not affecting the binding affinity of the C4domain for GPIIbIIIa Instead, the increased VWF dimer flexibility enhances temporal accessibility of platelet binding sites Using an interdisciplinary approach, we revealed that pPro2555Arg is the first VWF variant, which increases platelet aggregate size and show a sheardependent function of the VWF stem region, which can become hyperactive through mutations Prothrombotic GOF variants of VWF are a novel concept of a VWFassociated pathomechanism of thromboembolic events, which is of general interest to vascular health but which is not yet considered in diagnostics Thus, awareness should be raised for the risk they pose Furthermore, our data implicate the C4domain as a novel antithrombotic drug target,,Abstract  Background The clinical presentation of SARSCoV2 disease ranges from asymptomatic respiratory infection to acute respiratory distress syndrome Risk factors upon hospital admission associated with the need for invasive mechanical ventilation are not well documented   Methods 185 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID19 were enrolled in this study, and they were classified as patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation and patients who did not require it Comorbidities such as diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, chronic lung disease and immunodeficiency were recorded Laboratory studies were requested upon admission such as Creactive protein, leukocyte and lymphocyte levels, Ddimer, troponin, serum ferritin and procalcitonin   Results Of the patients who entered the study, 65 patients 35 required invasive mechanical ventilation IMV, while 120 65 did not require advanced airway management Of the patients with invasive mechanical ventilation, age  65 years, male sex, obesity BMI  30 and high blood pressure were the most frequent characteristics, presenting the latter two in 26 and 27 respectively Regarding laboratory studies, the parameters most associated with the requirement for mechanical ventilation were a Ddimer  1000 and troponin  1, with 26 and 18, respectively   Conclusion This study showed the high proportion of obesity, hypertension and advanced age among patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation associated with SARSCoV2 infection The presence of elevated Ddimer and troponin on admission are associated with more severe presentations and a requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation   Disclosures All Authors No reported disclosures,Background COVID19 may become a lifethreatening illness as a result of acute respiratory distress syndrome with the mainstay of management supportive, although dexamethasone and serum from recovered patients look helpful in reducing mortality in oxygen dependant patients Methods We retrospectively analysed data from 22 patients with severe COVID19 treated with trimethoprim TMP or cotrimoxazole CTX added to standard therapy antibiotics ST and compared this with anonymized data from 22 patients with COVID19 of similar severity receiving ST alone Results Patients receiving additional TMP or CTX showed clinical improvement within 48 hours with reduced fever p 0001, Creactive protein levels p0002 and oxygen requirements SpO2FiO2, p0001 Mortality was reduced to 5 versus 32 for ST, p0022 and the need for ventilatory support 3 versus 16 patients on ST, p0001 and hospital length of stay mean 9 days versus 22 days on ST p0001 Discussion This benefit may be due to combined antimicrobial and immunological effects of TMP and CTX Both drugs block stimulation of the formyl peptide receptors FPRs on the surface of circulating neutrophils and monocytes When stimulated, FPRs cause homing of neutrophils to the lung and trigger the release of Reactive Oxygen Series driving cytokine production and therefore a possible cytokine storm Stressed neutrophils can extrude their nuclear content as external nets NETosis to trap infectious agents, these nets can block the pulmonary alveolar bed giving severe hypoxia and death as seen in post mortems from COVID19 patients Blocking of neutrophil FPRs by these drugs may be the mechanism by which they protect the lung in COVID19,BACKGROUND Cardiovascular disease and cancer have been described as possible risk factors for COVID19xa0mortality The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a history of cardiovascular disease or cancer affects the risk of dying after a COVID19 diagnosis in Norway MATERIAL AND METHOD Data were compiled from the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases, the Norwegian Cardiovascular Disease Registry and the Cancer Registry of Norway Univariable and multivariable regression models were used to calculate both relative and absolute risk RESULTS In the first half of 2020, 8 809xa0people tested positive for SARSCoV2 and 260 COVID19associated deaths were registered Increasing age, male sex relative risk RR 15 confidence interval CI 1220, prior stroke RR 15 CI 1021 and cancer with distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis RR 30 CI 1182 were independent risk factors for death after a diagnosis of COVID19 After adjusting for age and sex, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, hypertension, and nonmetastatic cancer were no longer statistically significant risk factors for death INTERPRETATION The leading risk factor for death among individuals who tested positive for SARSCoV2 was age Male sex, and a previous diagnosis of stroke or cancer with distant metastasis were also associated with an increased risk of death after a COVID19 diagnosis,Disorders of the hemostatic system and inflammation play a key role in the pathogenesis of new coronavirus pneumonia NCP, determining its course and outcome To study the dynamics of the state of the hemostasis system and the severity of the acute phase response in patients with new coronavirus pneumonia We determined APTT, prothrombin time PT, fibrinogen F, Ddimers Dd, antitrombin III AT III, Creactive protein CRP, platelet count in 22 patients In 49 patients, the viscoelastic properties of a blood clot were studied by thromboelastography TEG with koalin The age of the patients ranged from 40 to 77 years According to CT, the severity of 100 cases corresponded to CT2CT3 Acute respiratory failure ARF was diagnosed in 16 patients A control group included 25 apparently healthy subjects During hospitalization, patients with NCP were characterized by an increase in the concentration of Dd, CRP, Fg, lengthening of APTT and PT, ATIII activity and platelet count not differing from the normal range 10 days after hospitalization and against the background of ongoing therapy, patients with NCP showed positive dynamics in the hemostasiological profile and the severity of the inflammatory response Thromboelastography indices in patients with LCP did not differ from control values both at hospitalization and on day 10Thus, in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia, an increased prothrombotic activity and a pronounced inflammatory response are recorded Against the background of treatment, there is a positive dynamics in both the coagulation status and the inflammatory response Additional studies are needed to determine the diagnostic capabilities of thromboelastography in patients with NCP,COVID19 associated coagulopathy and mortality related to thrombotic complications have been suggested as biological mediators in racial disparities related to COVID19 We studied the adjusted prevalence of acute ischemic stroke, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and deep venous thrombosis stratified by race in hospitalized patients in one New York City borough during the local COVID19 surge The multiracial cohort included 4299 patients hospitalized with COVID19, 9 of whom were white, 40 black, 41 Hispanic and 10 Asian or other We found a 61 prevalence of composite thrombotic events There were no significant racespecific differences in thrombotic events when adjusting for basic demographics, socioeconomic factors, medical comorbidities or biomarkers using a stepwise regression model We therefore found no evidence that the racial disparities related to COVID19, and specifically thrombotic complications, are caused by biological differences in race,INTRODUCTION Coronavirus disease of 2019 COVID19 is a lower respiratory tract infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 This disease can impact the cardiovascular system and lead to abnormal electrocardiographic ECG findings Emergency clinicians must be aware of the ECG manifestations of COVID19 OBJECTIVE This narrative review outlines the pathophysiology and electrocardiographic findings associated with COVID19 DISCUSSION COVID19 is a potentially critical illness associated with a variety of ECG abnormalities, with up to 90 of critically ill patients demonstrating at least one abnormality The ECG abnormalities in COVID19 may be due to cytokine storm, hypoxic injury, electrolyte abnormalities, plaque rupture, coronary spasm, microthrombi, or direct endothelial or myocardial injury While sinus tachycardia is the most common abnormality, others include supraventricular tachycardias such as atrial fibrillation or flutter, ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, various bradycardias, interval and axis changes, and ST segment and T wave changes Several ECG presentations are associated with poor outcome, including atrial fibrillation, QT interval prolongation, ST segment and T wave changes, and ventricular tachycardiafibrillation CONCLUSIONS This review summarizes the relevant ECG findings associated with COVID19 Knowledge of these findings in COVID19related electrocardiographic presentations may assist emergency clinicians in the evaluation and management of potentially infected and infected patients,Everyone must have the ability to endure the heart and lungs of the body, especially for activities in physical activities For sports students, the ability of heart and lung endurance is an important asset in carrying out activities, not only to support activities in lectures but also to support activities outside of lectures This study aims to measure the level of cardiovascular endurance Tests and measurements were carried out using the 12 km running test The sample to be studied is sports education students class 2019, Indonesian technocrat University This research is a survey analysis research using descriptive statistics From the results of data collection, it was found that 5 students with a percentage of 641 had very good heart and lung levels Students with the ability of heartlung level who were classified into good categories were 23 students with a percentage of 29, 48 Classification of pulmonary heart rate in the medium category was 48 students with a percentage of 6254 Thus, the level of cardiovascular endurance of sports education students class of 2019 is classified as moderate,Introduction Obesity, diabetes, hypertension and age have been pointed at as factors that influence on the progression of COVID19 however, evidence for other conditions is inconclusive Objective To identify which clinical characteristics are related to COVID19 severity and to determine whether age acts a modifier of the relationship between cardiometabolic comorbidities CMC and COVID19 progression Method Data on  20yearold confirmed cases n  159,017 were analyzed Hospitalization, development of pneumonia, intubation requirement, intensive care unit admission and death were the dependent variables in Poisson regression models estimation, whereas the interaction between age and different CMCs were the independent variables Results Having CMCs, as well as other comorbidities, was directly related to COVID19 progression, whereas chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was only related to an increase in the risk of dying The risk for COVID19 severity was lower as age was more advanced Asthma and smoking were not risk factors for the progression of COVID19 Conclusion In the Mexican population, the risk of COVID19 progression associated with comorbidities was higher in young adults,,BACKGROUND Aortic sac hygroma and concealed endoleaks EL after endovascular aneurysm repair EVAR of abdominal aortic aneurysm needs particular attention with aggressive management as they are associated with rapid sac expansion and rupture risk However, they can be erroneously reported as type IV or V EL with supine computed tomography CT scans, leading to delay in management Therefore, we describe a novel diagnostic technique, Prone contrASt enHanced computed tomography Angiography PASHA, to document concealed EL METHODS We present eight case descriptions with continuous sac expansion after primary EVAR Management began with diagnosis using the PASHA imaging technique PASHA is a multiphase CTA positional technique for increasing the accuracy of detecting EL after EVAR Furthermore, the PASHA imaging technique also guides whether the open or endovascular intervention could be used effectively to manage the sac expansion In synchrony with the PASHA technique, EVAR GORE SalvAge FAbric Technique ARAFAT was to salvage previous EVAR RESULTS The PASHA technique diagnosed all cases of type IIIb EL, as it enhanced the degree of contrast infiltration into the aortic sac when microleaks were present ARAFAT was effectively used in five elderly patients Another three had an open conversion two with double breasting of the aortic sac and one EVAR explantation CONCLUSIONS The PASHA protocol helped classify and localize the concealed EL type IV, V, which were not appropriately diagnosed by supine CT protocols PASHA and ARAFAT were used as a fully functioning protocol to overcome apparent challenges in accurate diagnosis and subsequent concealed EL management in highrisk patients,Background                     Telemedicine is an alternative to the standard consultation with a specialist during COVID19 pandemic Though their benefits are not well studied, the phone consultations are a potential effective resource for providing medical and psychosocial help to patients with chronic diseases during social isolation                     Aim                     To assess the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients, who looked for cardiology help on the phone, and the most common reasons for these consultations                     Material and Methods                     We analyzed the data of 196 consecutive patients with chronic cardiovascular diseases, who called for cardiology consultation at the National Patients Organization between 22042020 and 31072020                     Results                     The mean age of the included patients was 71,7  11,3 years 17 ÷ 92, and 149 of them 76 were above the age of 65 years who we defi ned as elderly 114 58 of the consulted on the phone were females 96 patients 49 called from Sofi a The mean duration of the call was 8,5 minutes The most common reasons for teleconsultation were unstable blood pressure  in 30 of the patients n  59 and anxiety  17 n  33 Other reasons for seeking cardiology help were adjusting the therapy different from the antihypertensive one  8, chest pain  7, dyspnea  7, questions about followup of a chronic disease  7, palpitations  6, monitoring of INR  4, second opinion before an operation or a procedure  2, problems getting medications or protocols  1,5, administrative issues TELKLKK  1,5 The most common chronic diseases of the consulted were arterial hypertension 89, heart failure 31, ischemic heart disease 25, diabetes mellitus 22 and atrial fibrillation 15                     Conclusion                     During COVID19 pandemic the elderly and the women more often look for cardiology help on the phone The suboptimal control of the blood pressure and the anxiety, caused by the pandemic, are the most common reasons for phone consultations of the patients with chronic cardiovascular diseases,Aim Covid19 is one of the most important pandemics in the world history Chronic diseases, which are risk factors that increase the case fatality rates, have been the leading cause of death all over the world In this study, it was aimed to detect coexisting diseases in patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of Covid19xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0Material and Method It was carried out with the data of 229 inpatients in an intensive care unit between 01062020  30062020 Among the inclusion criteria of the study it is necessary to have a diagnosis confirmed by PCR test, to be hospitalized in the relevant intensive care unit on the date of the study and to have data accessible through the hospital automation system According to literature chronic diseases of the patients and their effects on the covid19 process were evaluated Statistical analyzes were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences SPSS version 240 IBM Corp  Armonk, NY, USAResults It was seen that the average age of the patients were 614159 years old While the average symptom duration was 8253 days total hospitalization period was 13159 days The length of stay of 75 patients who were sent to intensive care unit was determined as 10171 The most common chronic disease among patients was hypertension with 472 This was followed by diabetes mellitus 328 and heart disease 275, respectively In the presented study, cough 594, fever 585 and shortness of breath 459 were found to be the most common symptoms Leukopenia, impairments in liver and muscle enzymes, abnormal Creactive protein, ferritin and ddimer levels were the important laboratory findingsConclusion Particular attention should be paid to the elderly Covid19 patients with chronic diseases, especially DM, HT and cancer,This paper presents a clinical case of a 39yearold pregnant woman with respiratory signs of the novel coronavirus Covid19 infection Chest MRI showed bilateral lesions in basal segments The PCR test was positive A lung condition was assessed without loss of significant diagnostic information Besides that, the absence of exposure to ionizing radiation allowed to avoid a high loading dose on the patient and the fetus This case reveals potential opportunities of MRI in the diagnosis of pulmonary pathology without exposure to ionizing radiation, especially in patient risk groups children, pregnant women, etc,Summary The current spreading novel coronavirus SARSCoV2 is highly infectious and pathogenic In this study, we screened the gene expression of three SARSCoV2 host receptors ACE2, DCSIGN and LSIGN and DC status in bulk and single cell transcriptomic datasets of upper airway, lung or blood of smokers, nonsmokers and COVID19 patients We found smoking increased DCSIGN gene expression and inhibited DC maturation and its ability of T cell stimulation In COVID19, DCSIGN gene expression was interestingly decreased in lung DCs but increased in blood DCs Strikingly, DCs shifted from cDCs to pDCs in COVID19, but the shift was trapped in an immature stage CD22 or ANXA1 DC with MHCII downregulation in severe cases This observation indicates that DCs in severe cases stimulate innate immune responses but fail to specifically recognize SARSCoV2 Our study provides insights into smoking effect on COVID19 risk and the profound modulation of DC function in severe COVID19  Graphical Abstract      Highlights  Smoking upregulates the expression of ACE2 and CD209 and inhibits DC maturation in lungs SARSCoV2 modulates the DCs proportion and CD209 expression differently in lung and blood  Severe infection is characterized by DCs less capable of maturation, antigen presentation and MHCII expression DCs shift from cDCs to pDCs with SARSCoV2 infection but are trapped in an immature stage in severe cases,BACKGROUND xa0 Effective and safe tools assisting triage decisions for COVID19 patients could optimize the pressure on the healthcare system COVID19 often has respiratory manifestations, and medical imaging techniques provide an opportunity to assess the diseases severity AIMS xa0 To estimate the sensitivity and specificity of lung ultrasound for different degrees of pulmonary involvement in COVID19 patients by a systematic review of English articles using PubMed and Google Scholar databases Search terms included lung ultrasound, chest ultrasound, thoracic ultrasound, ultrasonography, COVID19, SARSCoV2, coronavirus, diagnosis, diagnostic value, specificity, and sensitivity Only studies addressing lung ultrasound diagnostic accuracy for patients with suspected COVID19 using thoracic computed tomography, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, or laboratory data as a reference standard were included Independent extraction of articles was performed by two authors using predefined data fields with subsequent assessment of study quality indicators The randomeffect model was used to analyze and pool lung ultrasound sensitivity and specificity across the included studies Sixteen studies met our inclusion criteria, but only three of them divided patients into distinct and defined groups depending on the disease severity We used the remaining studies data to assess the secondary outcomes the values of sensitivity and specificity of lung ultrasound for COVID19 regardless of the patients clinical status Heterogeneity for primary and secondary outcomes was observed that remained when pooling for different scenarios screening, assessing severity and cohorts of participants Lung ultrasound had the highest accuracy for confirmed COVID19 patients with severe disease sensitivity 876  123, specificity 805  71, and the lowest accuracy for the patients with mild disease sensitivity 728  71, specificity 743  27 CONCLUSIONS xa0Lung ultrasound can be used in patients with confirmed COVID19 to detect serious damage to the lung tissue The diagnostic value of the method for assessing mild and moderate lung lesions is relatively low,Cardiac injury is a common condition among patients hospitalized with COVID19, and it is associated with a higher risk of inhospital mortality Since the first data analyses in China, elevated cardiac troponin has been noted in a substantial proportion of patients, implicating myocardial injury as a possible pathogenic mechanism contributing to severe illness and mortality Physicians need to pay heed to the possibility of myocarditis in cases of COVID19 We present a first possible SARSCoV2 associated myocarditis case, confirmed by autopsy examination The overlap with acute coronary syndrome, acute decompensated heart failure should be taken into consideration in the current state to COVID19 epidemics,Novel coronavirus19 disease COVID19 is associated with significant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality These twocase report suggest that transient sinus bradycardia is a possible manifestation of COVID19 and an important for close surveillance 1 These cases were presented with isolated symptomatic primary sinus bradycardia which was transient and disappear by the recovery of the COVID19 infection,Asthma exacerbations occur across a wide spectrum of chronic severity they contribute to millions of emergency department ED visits in both children and adults every year Management of asthma exacerbations is an important part of the continuum of asthma care The best strategy for ED management of an asthma exacerbation is early recognition and intervention, continuous monitoring, appropriate disposition, and, once improved, multifaceted transitional care that optimizes subacute and chronic asthma management after ED discharge This article concisely reviews ED evaluation, treatment, disposition, and postdischarge care for patients with asthma exacerbations, based on highquality evidence eg, systematic reviews from the Cochrane Collaboration and current international guidelines eg, the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel Report 3, Global INitiative for Asthma, and Australian guidelines Special populations young children, pregnant women, and the elderly also are addressed Despite advances in asthma science, there remain many important evidence gaps in managing ED patients with asthma exacerbation This article summarizes several of these controversial areas and challenges that merit further investigation,,BACKGROUND The occurrence of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 has overwhelmed the blood supply chain worldwide and severely influenced clinical procedures with potential massive blood loss, such as clipping surgery for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage aSAH Whether acute normovolemic hemodilution ANH is safe and effective in aneurysm clipping remains largely unknown METHODS Patients with aSAH who underwent clipping surgery within 72 hours from bleeding were included The patients in the ANH group received 400 mL autologous blood collection, and the blood was returned as needed during surgery The relationships between ANH and perioperative allogeneic blood transfusion, postoperative outcome, and complications were analyzed RESULTS Sixtytwo patients with aSAH were included between December 2019 and June 2020 20 in the ANH group and 42 in the nonANH group ANH did not reduce the need of perioperative blood transfusion 3 15 vs 5 119 Pxa0 0734 However, ANH significantly increased serum hemoglobin levels on postoperative day 1 115  25 gdL vs 103  20 gdL Pxa0 0045 and day 3 121  20 gdL vs 107  13 gdL Pxa0 0002 Multivariable analysis indicated that serum hemoglobin level on postoperative day 1 odds ratio, 0895 95 confidence interval, 08220973 Pxa0 0010 was an independent risk factor for unfavorable outcome, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that it had a comparable predictive power to World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grade Zxa0 0275 P  005 CONCLUSIONS ANH significantly increased postoperative hemoglobin levels, and it may hold the potential to improve patients outcomes Routine use of ANH should be considered in aneurysm clipping surgery,,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 is the recently identified cause of the current pandemic In patients with chronic respiratory lung diseases, SARSCoV2 may result in significant morbidity and increased mortality We present a case of a 69yearold male with stage II pulmonary sarcoidosis who had been under observation for 30 months without immunosuppressive treatment He then developed severe SARSCoV2 disease with typical radiological and laboratory findings Therapy with oxygen, antibiotics, lowmolecularweight heparin in a prophylactic dose, and dexamethasone resulted in marked clinical improvement We will discuss the rationale for corticosteroid use in both SARSCoV2 disease and in SARSCoV2 disease that is complicating comorbid sarcoidosis,,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 pandemic has raised new challenges in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism PE 1 Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 are at increased risk of developing venous thromboembolism, but symptoms of COVID19 and PE may overlap, which makes it difficult to identify those with a higher likelihood of PE Simple and minimally invasive diagnostic algorithms that can safely ruleout PE in patients with COVID19 are urgently needed Therefore, we read with interest the recent paper by Mouhat et al 2 in the European Respiratory Journal Ddimer thresholds for rulingout pulmonary embolism should not be selected based on the optimal Youdens index httpsbitly2Mfp4on,BACKGROUND COVID19 is considered the most critical health pandemic of 21st century Due to extremely high transmission rate, people are more susceptible to viral infection COVID19 patients having chronic type2 asthma prevails a major risk as it may aggravate the disease and morbidities OBJECTIVE The present review mainly focuses on correlating the influence of COVID19 in type2 asthmatic patients Besides, it delineates the treatment measures and drugs that can be used to manage mild, moderate, and severe symptoms of COVID19 in asthmatic patients, thus preventing any exacerbation METHODS An indepth research was carried out from different peerreviewed articles till September 2020 from several renowned databases like PubMed, Frontier, MEDLINE, and related websites like WHO, CDC, MOHFW, and the information was analysed and written in a simplified manner RESULTS The progressive results were quite conflicting as severe cases of COVID19 shows an increase in the level of several cytokines that can augment inflammation to the bronchial tracts, worsening the asthma attacks Contradicting to this, certain findings reveal the decrease in the severity of COVID19 due to the elevation of Tcells in type2 asthmatic patients, as prominent reduction of Tcell is seen in most of the COVID19 positive patients This helps to counteract the balance of immune responses and hence ameliorate the disease progression CONCLUSION Asthmatic patients must remain cautious during the COVID19 pandemic by maintaining all the precautions to stay safe due to limited research data Future strategies should include a better understanding of asthmatic exacerbation and its relation to COVID19,Older age and cardiovascular comorbidities are wellknown risk factors for allcause mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 Hypertension and age are the 2 principal determinants of arterial stiffness AS This study aimed to estimate AS in patients with COVID19 requiring hospitalization and analyze its association with allcause inhospital mortality This observational, retrospective, multicenter cohort study analyzed 12u2009170 patients admitted to 150 Spanish centers included in the SEMICOVID19 Network We compared AS, defined as pulse pressure 60 mmu2009Hg, and clinical characteristics between survivors and nonsurvivors Mean age was 675 161 years and 425 were women Overall, 2606 214 subjects died Admission systolic blood pressure BP 120 and 140 mmu2009Hg was a predictor of higher allcause mortality 235 and 228, respectively, P0001, compared with systolic BP between 120 and 140 mmu2009Hg 186 The 4379 patients with AS 360 were older and had higher systolic and lower diastolic BP Multivariate analysis showed that AS and systolic BP 120 mmu2009Hg significantly and independently predicted allcause inhospital mortality adjusted odds ratio ORadj 127, P00001 ORadj 148, P00001, respectively after adjusting for sex males, ORadj 16, P00001, age tertiles second and third tertiles, ORadj 20 and 47, P00001, Charlson Comorbidity Index second and third tertiles, ORadj 48 and 86, P00001, heart failure, and previous and inhospital antihypertensive treatment Our data show that AS and admission systolic BP 120 mmu2009Hg had independent prognostic value for allcause mortality in patients with COVID19 requiring hospitalization,Purpose To analyze the survival of patients hospitalized with COVID19 and who presented some vascular thrombotic complication Material and Methods All consecutive patients with COVID19 who were treated during the months of March and April 2020 at our institution were included All patients were symptomatic and the thrombotic event objectively confirmed Patients with deep vein thrombosis DVT, pulmonary embolism PE, ischemic stroke, and peripheral arterial thrombosis PAT were included Survival curves for all groups were analyzed using KaplanMeier with Log Rank test, and Cox regression Results During the pandemic period from March1 to April30, 2943 patients were treated with confirmed COVID19 in our center 106 patients showed some symptomatic vascular thrombosis 13 patients had PAT, 15 ischemic stroke, 20 DVT and 58 PE 11 patients presented multiple vascular thrombosis Although the mean age was 65 years, there were differences between groups being older those patients with arterial thrombosis A 6792 were men In total, 25 patients died during their hospital admission 2358, with differences between groups, being more common in patients with PAT 9 patients out of 13 and ischemic stroke 8 patients out of 15, than in those with DVT 1 patient out of 20 or PE 7 patients out of 58 Conclusions The venous thromboembolic risk in these patients is greater than the arterial, but arterial thrombosis when it occurs was associated with high mortality rates Survival was better in patients with DVT and PE than in patients with ischemic stroke or PAT,These largescale studies confirm previous findings about a slightly increased incidence of COVID19, but not of severe COVID19, in asthma patients Still, no definitive conclusions can be drawn since many bias factors have not been taken into account,,PURPOSE OF REVIEW The new pandemic of coronavirus disease2019 COVID19 has produced a global tumult and has overburdened national health systems We herein discuss the cardiovascular implications and complications of this pandemic analyzing the most recent data clustered over the last several months RECENT FINDINGS COVID19 afflicts the cardiovascular system producing acute cardiac injury in 1020 of cases with mild disease but in greater than 5060 in severe cases, contributing to patients demise Other cardiovascular complications include arrhythmias, heart failure, pulmonary embolism and shock Offlabel therapies are being trialed with their own inherent cardiovascular risks, while supportive therapies currently dominate, until more specific and effective antiviral therapies and vaccinations become available A controversial issue relates to the safety of drugs blocking the reninangiotensin system as an angiotensinconverting enzyme ACE homologue, ACE2, serves as the receptor for viral entry into host cells However, todate, no harm has been proven for these drugs SUMMARY In the cardiovascular system, COVID19 can induce acute cardiac injury, arrhythmias, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, shock and death, whereas antiCOVID therapies also confer serious cardiovascular sideeffects Ongoing extensive efforts focus on specific vaccines and antivirals Meanwhile, cardiovascular risk factors and diseases should be jointly controlled according to current evidencebased guidelines,Since the widespread of acute respiratory syndrome infection caused by coronavirus19, unenhanced computed tomography CT was considered a useful imaging tool commonly used in early diagnosis and monitoring of patients with complicated Covid19 pneumonia If there is clinical or laboratory suspicion of pulmonary embolism complicating Covid19 pneumonia, CT angiogram of the pulmonary arteries may be necessary Here we describe the case of a 52 years old man, affected by a highrisk myelodysplastic syndrome patient, with Covid19 pneumonia, complicated by a bilateral massive acute pulmonary embolism An unenhanced CT and then a CT pulmonary angiography were made, and the patient was immediately hospitalized and treated,Abstract  Background HIV is a risk factor for Cardiovascular Disease CVD, and CVD is the leading cause of mortality among Hispanics H Hispanics in the US are disproportionately affected by HIV with higher rates of HIV related morbidity and mortality, as well as adverse CVD outcomes This study sought to identify early markers of CVD risk among Hispanics living with HIV   Methods Interim analysis of 38 H and nonHispanics NH people living with HIV PLWH, stable on antiretroviral regimen, 3050 years of age, without previously detected CVD Demographics, CD4 T cells, HIV RNA viral load, traditional early markers of CVD risk were collected CVD risk markers were obtained with noninvasive tools epicardial adipose tissue EAT thickness was assessed by echocardiogram arterial stiffness was assessed by applanation tonometry sequentially at the carotid, femoral and radial arteries including central augmentation index  AI, peripheral AI, radial pulse wave velocity  PWV, and femoral PWV The Framingham Coronary Event Risk Score FCER was calculated for each subject Descriptive and linear regression analysis for predictors of FCER measures were age adjusted   Results Among the 38 participants enrolled the mean age was 42 years, 80 male, H 76, NH 24, Black 16, with mean BMI of 267 45 met clinical criteria for metabolic syndrome high waist girth 24, high blood pressure 18, high Fasting Glucose 16, high total cholesterol 21, high triglycerides 26, low HDL 45, high LDL 18, high TCHDL ratio 68 The mean EAT was 38 mm, mean central AI 202 , mean peripheral AI 73, mean femoral PWV 288 ms, mean radial PWV 87 ms Older age was associated with greater central AI r  037, p 01 and peripheral AI r  038, p 01 but not with increased EAT Regression analysis predicting FCER relationships showed radial PWV as an independent predictor of increased FCER r  036, p  05   Conclusion Risk factors leading to CVD are common among this group of PLWH and radial PWV is a moderate predictor of increased FCER Although measures of arterial stiffness are available, they are not routinely used to assess CVD risk Further studies should evaluate the use of noninvasive methods for diverse PLWH, to prevent the development of CVD   Disclosures All Authors No reported disclosures,This latest

SARSCoV2, que ha afectado nuestro modo de vida y de trabajo, además de focalizar una gran proporción de la publicación científica Repasaremos las principales novedades en arritmias cardiacas y electrofisiología durante los últimos 12 meses, seleccionando en primer lugar los documentos de consenso más relevantes y las guías de práctica clínica de la Sociedad Europea de Cardiología y, posteriormente, aquellas publicaciones con mayor relevancia para el cardiólogo clínico This year has been marked by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 breakthrough that has substantially changed the way we work and live, as well as focalizing a high percentage of the scientific publication In this article we will review the main issues in the field of cardiac arrhythmias of the last 12 months, including consensus statements, the European Society of Cardiology guidelines, and the reports with the greatest relevance for the clinical cardiologist,,,,Introduction Covid19 is associated with a high risk of venous thromboembolism In addition, cases of arterial thromboembolism were also reported We investigated the effect of antiplatelet therapy on the disease course Methods We evaluated a cohort of inpatients with Covid19 nxa0u200bxa0u200b152 We recorded the patients demographic data, their comorbidities, medication use including the use of antiplatelets and anticoagulants, laboratory findings and data about mechanical ventilation We then separated the patients outcomes into either being „bad dead or referral to higher level of care or „good discharged Then we evaluated the factors that contributed to the patient needing ventilatory support and to showing typical radiological findings Results In our cohort, 21 patients received ventilatory support whereas 131 did not require the use of ventilators 127 patients had good outcomes and 25 had bad outcomes By using multivariate analysis, we found that the need for ventilatory support was the strongest predictor of a bad outcome All patients who were on ventilators displayed typical radiological findings The factors predicting the need for ventilatory support were LDH and CRP levels, the presence of cardiac conduction abnormalities as well as chronic lung conditions Cardiac conduction abnormalities, LDH and CRP levels, and the use of antiplatelets, were factors that predicted typical radiological findings Conclusions There was a higher incidence of typical radiological findings in patients on antiplatelet medication However, it did not translate into changes in the ventilation requirement or in the outcome The need for mechanical ventilation was the strongest predictor of a bad outcome,,,,,This book serves as a concise text on nail diseases and disorders, offering the most

carcinoma, pulmonary sarcoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumour etc Primary or secondary pulmonary parenchymal lymphomas presenting as large mass is distinctly rare We share the case of a young lady who presented with a large left lung mass almost entirely replacing the left lung parenchyma, with associated intrathoracic lymphadenopathy On evaluation she was proved to have primary mediastinal large Bcell lymphoma Treatment with an aggressive chemotherapy regimen led to complete remission of the parenchymal and nodal disease The uncommon radiological presentation and the excellent therapeutic response despite huge tumour load merit clinical attention,,,,,,OBJECTIVE To describe the scientific evidence of complications and the need for cardiovascular interventions in people hospitalized by Covid19 METHOD a scoping review carried out according to The Joanna Briggs Institute recommendations, in the MEDLINE, CINAHL, SCOPUS and Web of Science databases RESULTS A total of 11 published studies from December of 2019 to April of 2020, presenting low levels of evidence were selected The evidence described the myocardial injury as the most common cardiac complication reported in Covid19, reported in approximately 8 to 12 of all severe individuals, with indications for oxygen therapy interventions, thrombotic disorders prevention and treatment, hemodynamic monitoring and assessment tests of cardiac functions performance, along with biochemical markers of myocardial injury, yet not addressing nursing interventions CONCLUSION Cardiovascular complications and interventions have not shown consensus on the found evidence, requiring causal analysis by explanatory studies that support multiprofessional clinical protocols in health,This corrects the article DOI 104103lungindialungindia35020,BACKGROUND Data regarding the association between preexisting cardiovascular risk factors CVRFs and cardiovascular diseases CVDs and the outcomes of patients requiring hospitalization for coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 are limited Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of preexisting CVRFs or CVDs on the outcomes of patients with COVID19 hospitalized in a Korean healthcare system METHODS Patients with COVID19 admitted to 10 hospitals in Daegu Metropolitan City, Korea, were examined All sequentially hospitalized patients between February 15, 2020, and April 24, 2020, were enrolled in this study All patients were confirmed to have COVID19 based on the positive results on the polymerase chain reaction testing of nasopharyngeal samples Clinical outcomes during hospitalization, such as requiring intensive care and invasive mechanical ventilation MV and death, were evaluated Moreover, data on baseline comorbidities such as a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, current smoking, heart failure, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular accidents, and other chronic cardiac diseases were obtained RESULTS Of all the patients enrolled, 954 420 had preexisting CVRFs or CVDs Among the CVRFs, the most common were hypertension 288 and diabetes mellitus 170 The prevalence rates of preexisting CVRFs or CVDs increased with age P  0001 The number of patients requiring intensive care P  0001 and invasive MV P  0001 increased with age The inhospital death rate increased with age P  0001 Patients requiring intensive care 53 vs 16 P  0001 and invasive MV 43 vs 17 P  0001 were significantly greater in patients with preexisting CVRFs or CVDs Inhospital mortality 129 vs 31 P  0001 was significantly higher in patients with preexisting CVRFs or CVDs Among the CVRFs, diabetes mellitus and hypertension were associated with increased requirement of intensive care and invasive MV and inhospital death Among the known CVDs, coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure were associated with invasive MV and inhospital death In multivariate analysis, preexisting CVRFs or CVDs odds ratio OR, 179 95 confidence interval CI, 107301 P  0027 were independent predictors of inhospital death after adjusting for confounding variables Among individual preexisting CVRF or CVD components, diabetes mellitus OR, 243 95 CI, 151390 P  0001 and congestive heart failure OR, 243 95 CI, 106587 P  0049 were independent predictors of inhospital death CONCLUSION Based on the findings of this study, the patients with confirmed COVID19 with preexisting CVRFs or CVDs had worse clinical outcomes Caution is required in dealing with these patients at triage,Coronavirus disease 19 COVID19 poses the greatest public health threat in 100 years, with cases rising rapidly in many countries around the world We report a case of a 78yearold female who exhibited a biphasic course of COVID19 showing initial clinical improvement followed by deterioration before making a full recovery The patient was managed with prolonged continuous positive airway pressure CPAP and supportive care In total, 24 days of treatment with CPAP was administered We emphasize the role of CPAP in the management of severely hypoxemic patients who are inappropriate for mechanical ventilation and describe the role of adequate nutrition and hydration for such patients,Coronavirus disease2019 COVID19 pneumonia is one of the severe and most dreaded forms of illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 It often progresses to respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation ARDS can lead to multiple complications while on mechanical ventilation due to positive airway pressures in a fibrotic lung, one such complication is the development of alveolopleural fistula Alveolopleural fistula has high morbidity and mortality We used endobronchial valve in a patient with COVID19related ARDS with persistent air leak alveolopleural fistula, which allowed us to remove the chest tube and wean the patient successfully off mechanical ventilation,COVID19 infections are seen across all age groups, but they have shown to have a predisposition for the elderly and those with underlying comorbidities Patients with severe COVID19 infections and comorbidities are more prone to respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilator use, and ultimately succumb to these complications Little evidence exists of the prevalence of underlying lung comorbidities among COVID19 patients and associated mortality We performed a systematic review of the literature including PubMed Medline, Embase Ovid, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library The last date for our search was April 29, 2020 We included all original research articles on COVID19 and calculated prevalence of chronic lung disease patients among COVID19 patients using random effects model Further, we assessed for mortality rates among COVID19 patients associated with these lung comorbidities The authors identified 29 articles that reported prevalence of chronic lung conditions among COVID19 patients Among those, 26 were from China and 3 from the United States The pooled prevalence of lung comorbidities including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD, and lung cancer was 3 95 confidence interval CI  014, 22 95 CI  002003, and 21 95 CI  000021, respectively Mortality rates associated with these comorbidities was 30 41137 for COPD and 19 737 for lung cancer respectively No mortality rates were reported for patients with asthma This study offers latest evidence of prevalence of chronic lung conditions among patients with COVID19 Asthma, followed by COPD and lung cancer, was the most common lung comorbidity associated with COVID19, while the higher mortality rate was found in COPD Future studies are needed to assess other lung comorbidities and associated mortality among patients diagnosed with COVID19,Background Till date, SARS CoV2 COVID19 is a pandemic viral infection in the world with the main and strong impact on respiratory airway, but this virus can affect any system of the human body Aims This research is aimed to dictating the effect of SARS CoV2 infections on hematological, biochemical, and arterial blood gas parameters by using their mean values Settings and Design This retrospective study was included a total no of 97 SARS CoV2 positive patients from 27 March to 15 May 2020 All positive patients were consented and took all the significant details Materials and Methods We review the total 97 COVID19 positive patients after obtaining all the hematological and other relevant clinical data from laboratory and medical records The subjects were tabulated into three categories named admitted Gp A, discharged Gp B, and expired Gp C patients and compared their hematological, biochemical parameters, and arterial blood gas analysis by using blood or serum and processed by proper methods Statistical Analysis The data was cleaned, edited, checked for completeness, and processed then entered in SPSS version 20 statistical software Results Blood samples were collected of all positive patients Most of the patients had Xray changes Blood parameters showed that patients who were expired GpC suffered from anemia, lymphopenia, leucoytosis, neutrophilia, and thrombocytopenia with high ALT, pCO2 and low pO2 than admitted and expelled patients Conclusions Result from this study provides that WBC count, absolute lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, and pO2 were independently associated and an important forecaster of mortality from SARS CoV2 All healthcare provides to regularly monitor above parameters indicators of COVID19 infected patients to improve their quality of life and to reduce the risk of mortality rate,An elderly hypertensive lady presented with fever, respiratory symptoms, and mild abdominal discomfort and was diagnosed to have COVID19 pneumonia Respiratory symptoms improved with steroids, awake proning, high flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy and antibiotics After 4 days, she developed nonocclusive superior mesenteric artery thrombosis, which initially responded to anticoagulants but was complicated on tenth day by intestinal obstruction necessitating emergency surgery Challenges encountered perioperatively were multi systemic involvement, pneumonia, ventilation perfusion mismatch, sepsis along with technical difficulties like fogging of goggles, stuck expiratory valve on anesthesia machine, inaudibility through stethoscope and discomfort due to personal protective equipment Perioperative focus should be on infection prevention, maintenance of hemodynamics, and optimization of oxygenation with preoperative high flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy Ultrasound lung helps in correct placement of endotracheal tube We recommend daily machine check, taping of N95 mask to face and ambient operation theatre temperatures of 2022°C to reduce technical problems,Background Early differentiation between emergency department ED patients with and without coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is very important The diagnosis of COVID19 depends on realtime reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction RTPCR On imaging, computed tomography CT manifestations resemble those seen in viral pneumonias, with multifocal groundglass opacities and consolidation in a peripheral distribution being the most common findings Although these findings lack specificity for COVID19 diagnosis on imaging grounds, CT could be used to provide objective assessment about the extension of the lung opacities, which could be used as an imaging surrogate for disease burden We set out to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of chest CT scanning in detecting COVID19 in a population with suspected COVID19 patients Materials and Methods In this crosssectional singlecenter study performed on 348 cases with clinical suspicion of COVID19, all adult symptomatic ED patients had both a CT scan and a PCR upon arrival at CT results were compared with PCR test s and diagnostic accuracy was calculated Results Between February 15, 2020, and June 30, 2020, 348 symptomatic patients were included In total, 623 of patients had a positive PCR and 698 had a positive CT, resulting in a sensitivity of 942, specificity of 767, likelihood ratio LR of 294 and LR 018 The sensitivity of the CT tended to be higher in those with acute respiratory distress syndrome 1000, P  0017 and severe COVID19 985, P  0027 than in patients with mild 825, P  0047 and moderate COVID19 893, P  0039 The diagnostic ability of chest CT was found to be high with 863 concordance between findings of CT and PCR In 48 137 patients, discordant findings between CT and PCR were observed In most cases, the CT scan was considered suspicious for COVID19, while the PCR was negative 3748, 770 In the majority of these, the diagnosis at discharge was pulmonary infection n  26 541 Conclusion The accuracy of chest CT in symptomatic COVID suspect patients is high, but when used as a single diagnostic test, CT cannot accurately diagnose or exclude COVID19 Therefore, we recommend a combination of both CT and RTPCR for future followup, management, and medical surveillance,Background COVID19 pandemic has affected the world globally causing widespread repercussions on individuals physical, mental and emotional wellbeing In such times, sleep is likely to be affected Objective The aim of this study was to present the

needs to be addressed,Myocarditis, a nonischemic acquired cardiomyopathy, is an uncommon condition with multiple presentation patterns which may be initially difficult to recognize and may simulate other conditions such as acute myocardial infarction, pericarditis, septicemia, etc There are four distinct clinical presentation patterns that include 1 lowgrade nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue 2 symptoms that resemble an acute myocardial infarction, especially in younger individuals 3 a heart failure presentation which may be acute, subacute, or chronic and may be associated with cardiac conduction system defects and arrhythmias and 4 an arrhythmia presentation that may produce sudden cardiac death, especially in young athletes with minimal or no prodromal symptoms This chapter will provide a brief overview of various myocarditis etiologies and diagnostic modalities The ultimate focus will be directed toward neurologic manifestations of myocarditis and its subtypes, complications of specific therapies including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ECMO for refractory heart failure, and review the current literature regarding the appropriate use of therapeutic anticoagulation in myocarditis and heart failure for stroke prevention Covid19 infection has been discovered to cause myocarditis The emerging science will be discussed Nuances of brain death BD determination in patients receiving venoarterial ECMO for heart failure refractory to standard medical therapies will be discussed,,Nasal high flow therapy NHFT is a noninvasive respiratory therapy used to maintain a high fraction of inspired oxygen Fio2 by delivering a mixture of highflow oxygen and air This technique has several physiological advantages compared with other standard oxygen therapies, including a reduced anatomical dead space, a positive endexpiratory pressure, and sufficient humidification NHFT is attracting attention as an alternative respiratory support therapy for critically ill patients Here, we report the maintenance of intravenous sedation using NHFT during a dental treatment in an intellectually disabled patient with tracheal stenosis The patient was 148 cm tall, weighed 40 kg, and had a history of cardiac surgery for a doubleoutlet right ventricle He suffered from tracheal stenosis caused by the longterm placement of a tracheal tube after an operation No abnormalities were noted during a cardiac evaluation, including an echocardiogram and an electrocardiogram Chest computed tomography showed the stenosis of the main bronchus, resulting in a diameter of only 6 mm at the narrowest point For this reason, we considered that tracheal intubation during general anesthesia might carry a risk of airway stenosis, and we decided to maintain the intravenous sedation using NHFT without other active airway managements The sedation was induced and maintained using midazolam and propofol After an optimal sedation level was achieved, we inserted a nasal cannula for NHFT under an Fio2 setting of 04 and a flow of 30 lmin When an upper airway constriction occurred because of an increased anesthetic depth or the depression of the mandible, we increased the NHFT flow to 40 lmin and performed a jawlift maneuver The Spo2 remained stable under spontaneous respiration throughout the operation A few minutes after the end of the use of the sedatives, voluntary movements were observed Neither respiratory depression nor hemodynamic compromise was observed postoperatively We suggest that intravenous sedation with NHFT could be a safe and effective method for preventing airway obstruction in patients with tracheal stenosis and might also be applicable for patients with intellectually disability,Allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis are common and cause high socioeconomic burden Allergic disease is a matter of not just for a patient, but also for a family and the society The Korean government, the Korean Disease Control and Prevention Agency, started the nationwide asthma and atopic disease prevention and management plan in collaborations with the opinion leaders from the Korean Academy of Asthma, Allergy, and Clinical Immunology, and the Korea Asthma Allergy Foundation since 2007 Seoul Atopy · Asthma Education Information Center was established in 2008 by the Korean Disease Control and Prevention Agency and the Seoul metropolitan government to provide the reliable and accurate information on asthma and allergic diseases In 2011, Gyeonggido Atopy ∙ Asthma Education Information Center was established by the Korean Disease Control and Prevention Agency and the Gyeonggido provincial government The activities of the center are as follows 1 atopy ∙ asthmafriendly school program, 2 developmentdistribution of the educational materials, 3 open lectures for the community, patients, their caregivers, older people, nurses, pharmacists, and doctors, 4 collaborations with the Korean Disease Control and Prevention Agency, the Gyeonggido provincial government, the office of education, and the public health centers, 5 collaborations with the Gyeonggido fire services to educate 119 rescue teams on the allergic emergency conditions, 6 international collaborations In this article, 10 years of experience and achievement from the Gyeonggido Atopy ∙ Asthma Education Information Center were described, especially on the atopy ∙ asthmafriendly school program,Background Perhaps reflecting that children with COVID19 rarely exhibit severe respiratory symptoms and often remain asymptomatic, little attention has been paid to explore the immune response in pediatric COVID19 Here, we analyzed the phenotype and function of circulating neutrophils from children with COVID19Methods One seventyfour children with COVID19, 21 children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome MISC, and 40 healthy children were studied Neutrophil phenotype was analyzed by flow cytometry in blood samples Cytokine production and plasma levels of IgG antibodies directed to the spike protein of SARSCoV2 were measured by ELISA Cellfree DNA was quantified by fluorometryFindings Compared with healthy controls, neutrophils from children with COVID19 showed a lower expression of CD11b, CD66b, and Lselectin but a higher expression of the activation markers HLADR, CD64 and PECAM1 and the inhibitory receptors LAIR1 and PDL1 No differences in the pattern of cytokine production and NETs were observed when neutrophils from healthy children were compared with neutrophils from children with COVID19 Interestingly, the expression of CD64 not only distinguished asymptomatic from mild and moderate COVID19, but also positively correlated with the serum concentration of IgG antibodies directed to the spike protein of SARSCoV2Interpretation Acute lung injury is a prominent feature of severe COVID19 in adults A low expression of adhesion molecules together with a high expression of inhibitory receptors in neutrophils from children with COVID19 might prevent tissue infiltration by neutrophils preserving lung functionFunding FONCyT ANPCyT, UBA, ArgentinaDeclaration of Interests The authors

comprehensive reference on diffuse cystic lung diseases DCLDs DCLDs are a group of pathophysiologically heterogenous processes that are characterized by the presence of multiple spherical or irregularly shaped, thinwalled, airfilled spaces within the pulmonary parenchyma In recent years, tremendous advancements have been made in these diseases leading to improved understanding of the underlying pathophysiology, and improved outcomes with targeted therapies The authors, who are leading experts in the field, delineate DCLDs as a separate category distinct from other interstitial lung diseases, and have created this textbook specifically dedicated to this disease group This book begins with a chapter introducing the definition and classification of DCLDs Subsequent chapters address the pathogenic mechanisms underlying pulmonary cyst formation and provide a detailed overview of the radiological and pathological features of DCLDs The common as well as uncommon causes of DCLDs are comprehensively reviewed in individual chapters, as are the varied clinical presentations and extrapulmonary manifestations, and approaches to management and treatment The book culminates in a final chapter that presents a practical algorithmic approach to diagnosis that progresses from least invasive to most invasive approaches This textbook provides a onestop, comprehensive and integrated, clinical, radiologic, and pathologic overview of DCLDs that will be as useful to the practicing clinician as it is to the clinical investigator,Background Diseases of the respiratory system are leading global causes of chronic morbidity and mortality While advanced medical imaging technologies of today deliver detailed diagnostic information, a lowdose, fast, and inexpensive option for early detection andor followups is still lacking Here, we report on the first human application of a novel modality, namely Xray darkfield chest imaging, which might fill this gap Enabling the assessment of microstructural changes in lung parenchyma, this technique presents a more sensitive alternative to conventional chest Xrays, and yet requires only a fraction of the dose applied in computed tomography CT Methods For this first clinical evaluation, we have built a novel darkfield chest Xray system, which is also capable of simultaneously acquiring a conventional thorax radiograph 7 seconds, 0·035 mSv effective dose Representing a major medical condition, we selected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as study subject to obtain a first impression of potential diagnostic benefits relevant to humans For a collective of 77 patients with different disease stages, Xray darkfield and CTimages were acquired and visually assessed by 5 readers In addition, pulmonary function tests were performed for every patient The individual data sets were evaluated in a statistical workup using correlation testing, rankbased analysis of variance, and pairwise posthoc comparison Findings Compared to CTbased parameters quantitative emphysema ρ0·27, p0·0893 and visual emphysema ρ0·45, p0·0028, the darkfield signal ρ0·62, p0·0001 yields a stronger correlation with diffusion capacity in the evaluated collective Emphysema assessment based on darkfield chest Xray features yields consistent conclusions with findings from visual CT image interpretation and shows improved diagnostic performance in comparison to conventional clinical tests characterizing emphysema Interpretation Xray darkfield chest imaging allows the diagnosis of pulmonary emphysema as it provides relevant information representing the structural condition of lung parenchyma Significant diagnostic benefits are also expected for other lung disorders Funding Statement We acknowledge financial

upper airway muscle function during sleep and reduced obstructive sleep apnea OSA severity has revitalized interest in pharmacological therapies for OSA We evaluated the effect of 1week of reboxetine plus oxybutynin on OSA severityMethods We performed a randomized, placebocontrolled, doubleblind, crossover trial comparing 4 mg reboxetine plus 5 mg oxybutynin reboxy to placebo in OSA subjects After a baseline inlab polysomnogram PSG, patients performed PSGs after 7 nights of reboxy and 7 nights of placebo to compare apneahypopnea index AHI, primary outcome Response rate was based on the percentage of subjects with a 50 reduction in AHI from baseline Secondary outcomes included Epworth Sleepiness Scale ESS and psychomotor vigilance test PVT Home oximetry evaluated overnight oxygen desaturation ODI throughout treatmentResults 16 subjects aged 575161 years median interquartile range with body mass index 302636 kgm 2 completed the study Reboxy lowered AHI from 493557 eventsh at baseline to 181321 eventsh 59 median reduction compared with 392948 eventsh 6 median reduction on placebo p0·001 Response rate for reboxy was 81 versus 13 for placebo p0·001 Although ESS was not significantly lowered, PVT decreased from 250239312 ms on baseline to 223172244 ms on reboxy versus 264217284 ms on placebo p0·001 Home oximetry illustrated acute and sustained improvement in ODI on reboxy versus placeboConclusions The administration of reboxetineplusoxybutynin greatly decreased OSA severity and increased vigilance These results highlight potential possibilities for

than 40 mmHg during carotid endarterectomy CEA This study aimed to assess the validity of our selective shunting criterion by 1D0D hemodynamic simulation technologyMaterials and Methods We retrospectively reviewed 88 patients 95 cases of CEA and divided them into two groups based on the degree of contralateral internal carotid artery ICA stenosis ratio, which was determined as severe when the peak systolic velocity ratio of the ICA to the common carotid artery was 4 by carotid duplex ultrasonography Patients with severe stenosis or occlusion in contralateral ICA were classified as hypoperfusion group, and those without such contralateral ICA obstruction were classified as control groupResults Perioperatively, the mean carotid stump pressures were 33 mmHg in hypoperfusion group and 46 mmHg in the control group P0006 We simulated changes in carotid stump pressure according to the changes in the contralateral ICA stenosis ratio 1D0D simulation indicated a sharp decline in carotid stump pressure when the contralateral stenosis ratio was 50, while peripheral pressure of the middle cerebral arteries declined sharply at a 70 contralateral stenosis ratio At this ratio, the direction of the ipsilateral cerebral arterial flow became inverted, the carotid stump pressure became dependent on the basilar artery circulation, and the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery became hypoperfusedConclusion Our clinical and computersimulated results confirmed the validation of our carotid shunting criterion and suggested that contralateral ICA stenosis ratio over 70 is a safe indication of selective shunting during CEA,This book covers relevant concepts in nuclear cardiology, combining imaging techniques and clinical data to do so Today, nuclear cardiology is a worldwide discipline connected to the broader field of cardiovascular imaging The combination of clinical aspects symptoms, medications, previous cardiac procedures, ancillary exams and nuclear images is key to decisionmaking in clinical practice Thus, a book on this topic is essential to provide better outcomes for cardiology patients The chapters cover a comprehensive range of topics in current cardiology practice, such as ambulatory patients, patients in emergency settings, patients after complex cardiac procedures, and patients during and after the use of cancer therapies that are potentially toxic for the heart cardiooncology As such, multiple clinical scenarios are also presented patients with suspected coronary disease, patients with heart failure of unknown origin, patients with acute chest pain in the emergency department, patients with suspected pulmonary embolism, patients with complications of the left ventricular assist device, etc Furthermore, the book describes nuclear cardiology procedures and techniques, discusses the main clinical indications and scenarios for each procedure, presents new technological advances in the field machine learning and artificial intelligence tools, and mentions the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic Given its scope, the book offers a valuable guide and videos for various medical professionals, especially cardiologists and nuclear physicians,In integrative cardiovascular Chinese medicine, the heart zang is one of the five element organs The others include spleen, lung, kidney, and liver The heart zang has both material and spiritual aspects The material aspects involve Western medicine anatomy and physiology and acuanatomy in Chinese medicine Both systems describe the location of the heart, dimensions, structure, and other landmarks on the body, which are associated with structure and function In traditional Chinese medicine, cardiology belongs to the internal medicine department Generally, acuanatomy belongs to the acupuncture department Even though acupuncture is utilized from time to time for certain patients, it is not an important factor of study or routine patient care The spiritual aspects involve how the hormones and other biochemicals involved in zang organ and vascular physiology contribute to disease and how the Shen is affected Shen is part of the mind and the mind is housed in the heart,This book describes the relationship of the skin with cardiovascular disease It details the variety of genetic, autoimmune, metabolic and endocrine factors that link the two disciplines Recognition of one sign or symptom in dermatology can lead to the investigation and discovery of an important related cardiac condition, the recognition of which is important to prevent cardiovascular complications Similarly, a cardiac condition may be related to an underlying skin condition that requires treatment Genetic examples of such instances included within the book include pseudoxanthoma elasticum, epidermolysis bullosa with desmosome defects and plectin defects Marfan syndrome Autoimmune conditions include vasculitis, sarcoidosis, lupus metabolic conditions include insulin resistance, eruptive xanthomas with hypertriglyceridemias and elevated cholesterol endocrine disorders include thyroid acropachy with atrial fibrillation insulin resistance with coronary artery disease and psoriasis or hidradenitis suppurativa Skin and the Heart reviews the effects of genetic, autoimmune and endocrine diseases with connections between skin and heart It is therefore a key reference for all practitioners and researchers working in both disciplines,Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation includes essential interventions that help patients maximize functional potential due to progressive deconditioning or acute decompensation following an acute medical event The population of patients who benefit from both cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation is increasing as the population ages and heart disease remains a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality The principles of exercise physiology when applied to this population can reverse deconditioning, build cardiopulmonary reserve, and ultimately reduce morbidity and mortality in these populations The physically disabled also benefit from exercise conditioning The model of cardiac rehabilitation can also be applied to improve functional status of stroke patients, and this is an emerging area of interest supported by the shared pathophysiology and risk factors of cardiovascular conditions The benefits of supervised exercise can also be extended to patients with clinically recognized frailty and posttransplant decline in function Frailty is a complex diagnosis with multiple tools and approaches used to describe this syndrome,Goal Alveolar compliance is a main determinant of lung airflow The compliance of the alveoli is a function of their tissue fiber elasticity, fiber volume, and surface tension The compliance varies during respiration because of the nonlinear nature of fiber elasticity and the timevarying surface tension coating the alveoli Respiratory conditions, like acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis IPF affect fiber elasticity, fiber volume and surface tension In this paper, we study the alveolar tissue fibers and surface tension effects on lung mechanics Methods To better understand the lungs, we developed a physiologybased mathematical model to 1 describe the effect of tissue fiber elasticity, fiber volume and surface tension on alveolar compliance, and 2 the effect of timevarying alveolar compliance on lung mechanics for healthy, ARDS and IPF conditions Results We first present the model sensitivity analysis to show the effects of model parameters on the lung mechanics variables Then, we perform model simulation and validate on healthy nonventilated subjects and ventilated ARDS or IPF patients Finally, we assess the robustness and stability of this dynamic system Conclusions We developed a mathematical model of the lung mechanics comprising alveolar tissue and surfactant properties that generates reasonable lung pressures and volumes compared to healthy, ARDS, and IPF patient data,In integrative cardiovascular Chinese medicine, the study of the mechanisms of action in disease and recovery begins with physiological functioning of cardiac cells Aerobic energy metabolism includes various cellular energy sources, occurs within the sarcoplasmic reticulum involving ATP dependent calcium transport and NaKATPase, and other energy sources may include be synthesized from macronutrients and ketones Myocytes include cardiomyocytes and pacemaker cells, they have high density of mitochondria producing ATP for energy and move through the action potential depolarization and repolarization between systolic and diastolic pressure changes The endothelial cells function to influence vascular tone, control blood pressure, fluid infiltration in the kidneys, permeability, immunity and angiogenesis,In integrative cardiovascular Chinese medicine, the cardiac rhythms occur within the electrical system of the heart includes the SA node, AV node, Bundle of HIS and the septum The parasympathetic nervous system and sympathetic nervous system supply the Qi energy required for autonomic functioning,Objective To explore the therapeutic effect of autologous blood reinfusion combined with controlled hypotension in surgical spinal fixation during the outbreak of COVID19 Methods 30 patients with spinal internal fixation autologous blood transfusion combined with controlled hypotension were selected as the subjects during the epidemic period from December 2019 to June 2020 in our hospital and during the operation, on the basis of routine blood pressure reduction, the American Haemonetice Corporation autologous blood continuous reinfusion system was used to infuse the blood recovered during the operation to the patient through filtration and other procedures Results 30 patients had no complications such as fever and hemolysis And after the operation, the tube was dialed according to the drainage volume, the cervical thoracic and lumbar brace was customized, and the patient walked on the ground for one week After no abnormalities, the patient was discharged Intraoperative comparison of white blood cells WBC, red blood cells RBC, red blood cell pressure HCT, hemoglobin HGB, and coagulation time PT of patients with autologous blood before and after transfusion showed statistically significant differences before and after surgery P  0001 Conclusion During the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic, the internal fixation of spinal surgery used a recovery machine to collect intraoperative blood for reinfusion Intraoperative antihypertensive drugs were used to control blood pressure within a certain safe range The postoperative clinical observation effect was significant and safe especially at present the clinical significance during the epidemic was significant,When a polysomnography does not include neurophysiological signals such as EEG, EMG and EOG, what is being performed is a respiratory polygraphy The most extensive form of respiratory polygraphy comprises the respiratory movements of chest and abdomen, measuring the airflow separately at the mouth and nose, ECG or heart rate, and transcutaneous oxygen saturation In its most limited form, respiratory polygraphy measures only the airflow at the mouth andor nose, or only SpO2 oximetry In experienced hands, respiratory polygraphy can be used as an alternative method for diagnosing OSA or ruling it out The sleep technician needs to be familiar with the measurement method used, the underlying algorithm and the possibility of accessing raw data,Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ACE2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 TMPRSS2, two receptors on the cell membrane of bronchial epithelial cells, are indispensable for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 infection ACE2 receptor is increased among aged, males, and smokers As smoking upsurges ACE2 expression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD patients are prone to SARSCoV2 infection, and are at a higher risk for severe forms of COVID19 coronavirus disease 2019 once infected The expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in asthma patients is identical or less common to that of healthy participants ACE2 especially, tends to be low in patients with strong atopic factors and in those with poor asthma control Therefore, it could be speculated that asthma patients are not susceptible to COVID19 Epidemiologically, asthma patients are less likely to suffer from COVID19, and the number of hospitalized patients due to exacerbation of asthma in Japan is also clearly reduced during the COVID19 pandemic therefore, they are not aggravating factors for COVID19 Related academic societies in Japan and abroad still lack clear evidence regarding asthma treatment during the COVID19 pandemic, and recommend that regular treatment including biologics for severe patients be continued,Nutraceuticals, primarily herbaceous plants, contain phytochemicals that can alleviate cardiac dysfunction Important components active in this sphere include polyphenols, flavonoids, and guggulsterones Secondary metabolite terpenes also play an important role The herbal supplements that are active to moderate dyslipidemia, vascular changes, and hypertension are described Epigenetic mechanisms and modulations are detailed Some plants of importance, and their modes of action, are summarized,Although lung disease is the primary clinical outcome in COVID19 patients, how SARSCoV2 induces lung pathology remains elusive Here we describe a highthroughput platform to generate selforganizing, nearly identical, and geneticallymatched human lung buds derived from hESCs cultured on micropatterned substrates Synthetic lung buds resemble human fetal lungs and display proximodistal patterning of alveolar and airway tissue directed by KGF They are susceptible to infection by SARSCoV2 and endemic coronaviruses and can be used to track cell typespecific cytopathic effects in hundreds of lung buds in parallel We detected an increased susceptibility to infection in alveolar cells and identified cycling alveolar stem cells as new targets of SARSCoV2 We used this platform to test neutralizing antibodies that efficiently blocked SARSCoV2 infection and transmission Synthetic lung buds offer unlimited, rapid and scalable access to diseaserelevant tissue that recapitulates human lung morphogenesis to identify key vulnerabilities for COVID19 and respiratory virusesFunding This work was supported by the Pershing Square Foundation,

back to the heart and out to the rest of the body The capillaries connect the arterioles to the arteries and bring in red blood cells and white blood cells The veins return waste materials and gases back through the liver and heart to the pulmonary system to exchange CO2 for oxygen,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 is the cause of coronavirus disease 2019, it binds to angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2 to enter into human cells This study showed that knockdown of Tripartite motif containing 28 TRIM28 induces ACE2 expression and increases pseudotyped SARSCoV2 cell entry of A549 cells and primary pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells PAEpiCs Natural killer NK cellderived factors can inhibit TRIM28 and promote ACE2 expression in lung epithelial cells, which was partially reversed by depletion of interleukin2 and blocking of granzyme B Furthermore, TRIM28 knockdown enhanced interferonγ IFNγinduced ACE2 expression through a mechanism involving upregulating IFNγ receptor 2 IFNGR2 in both A549 and PAEpiCs Importantly, the upregulated ACE2 induced by TRIM28 knockdown and coculture of NK cells was partially reversed by dexamethasone in A549 cells but not PAEpiCs This study identified TRIM28 as a regulator of ACE2 expression and SARSCoV2 cell entryFunding This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China 81870327, 81770443

human life in the medical field about the heart such as the circulatory system of heart and heart rate machine with religiosity factor This research aims to analyze the relationships among medical in the human body, circular system of heart, and religiosity of heart Data gets from various sources books, journals, internet,,Since the first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 SARSCoV2 were reported at the end of 2019, this infection has spread around the globe, becoming a pandemic The use of face masks and respirators is an important public health measure to reduce or prevent transmission of SARSCoV2 Here we discuss the hypothetical mechanisms by which exercise with face masks orrespirators can induce detrimental effects on the cardiovascular system, potentially explaining adverse events suchas cardiac arrhythmias and spontaneous pneumothorax Although sudden death associated with the wearing of a face mask during running is a rare event, the risk is higher especially in those with existing cardiac comorbiditiesIn such cases, a mask designed specifically for runners with no or few side effects of oxygen deficiency should be considered instead,Background Sepsis patients with a concomitant Coronavirus COVID19 infection are related to a high morbidity and mortality rate We investigated a large cohort of sepsis patients with a concomitant COVID19 to determine clinical characteristics, laboratory and radiological findings, and predictors of mortality We developed a risk score for the estimation of sepsis risk in patients with COVID19Methods In the present study, we conducted a subanalysis from the international Health Outcome Predictive Evaluation Registry for COVID19 HOPECOVID19Registry Out of 5,837 patients with COVID19, 624 patients were diagnosed with sepsis according to the Sepsis3 International ConsensusFindings In multivariable analysis, the following risk factors were identified as independent predictors for developing sepsis current smoking, tachypnoea 22 breath per minute, haemoptysis, peripheral oxygen saturation SpO2  92, blood pressure BP systolic BP 90mmHg and diastolic BP 60mmHg, Glasgow coma scale GCS 15, elevated procalcitonin PCT, elevated troponin I TnI, and elevated Creatinine  15 mgdl By assigning odds ratio weighted points to these variables, the following three risk categories were defined to develop sepsis during admission lowrisk group probability of sepsis 31118 intermediaterisk group 248538 highriskgroup 583100 A score of 1 was assigned to current smoking, tachypnoea, decreased SpO2, decreased blood pressure, decreased GCS, elevated PCT, TnI, and creatinine, whereas a score of 2 was assigned to haemoptysisInterpretation The HOPE Sepsis Score including 9 parameters is useful in identifying highrisk COVID19 patients to develop sepsis Sepsis in COVID19 is associated with a high mortality rateFunding Statement Nonconditioned grant FUNDACIÓN

Committee in all involved centres,COVID19 has spread around the world rapidly Outing restrictions are performed globally to prevent the further spread of infection A healthy 49yearold man was taken in the ambulance due to severe dyspnea For the previous 10 days, he had been performing remote work at home mainly in a sitting position due to the outing restrictions for the prevention of COVID19 spread On admission, his blood pressure was low and could not be measured by automated sphygmomanometer, heart rate was 127 bpm, and oxygen saturation was 98 with oxygenation of 10Lmin by a mask with a reservoir Admission blood tests demonstrated markedly elevated Ddimer of 413μgmL and NTproBNP of 6973 pgmL Echocardiography demonstrated dilatation of the right ventricle and Dshaped deformity of the left ventricle without wall motion abnormality We started continuous intravenous norepinephrine and dobutamine due to the preshock status, and chest computed tomography revealed pulmonary thromboembolism PTE from the bilateral main pulmonary arteries to the subsegmental arteries We introduced extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and performed surgical embolectomy After the surgery, his vital signs and circulation stabilized Twenty days after the surgery, he was discharged from our hospital without any physical impediment Since he had no apparent genetic factors for thrombotic disorder, longterm sitting at home during remote work could have contributed to the thrombus formation leading to PTE Regardless of whether individuals are infected by COVID19, we must be alert for thromboembolism in the context of outing restrictions during the pandemic,Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 affects the lungs but also the cardiovascular system, especially since the spike protein of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 uses the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2, existing on the membrane of many cell species, as a receptor This connection has consequences on the reninangiotensin system, arterial pressure and coagulation The imbalance of blood pressure control and of the kinin system occurs in natural disease but is also partly reflected in some possible negative consequences following vaccination Knowledge of these mechanisms could help to identify the subjects most at risk of complications and to correctly carry out the causality assessment of adverse events,From December 2019, a 71yearold male underwent three cycles of a combination therapy of pomalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone for relapsed multiple myeloma and a very good partial response was achieved In March 2020, he developed a fever of 389°C and computed tomography revealed bilateral groundglass opacities Antibiotic therapy was ineffective Bronchoscopy was performed and bortezomibinduced lung injury was initially suspected Due to respiratory exacerbation, highdose steroid therapy was administered, which resulted in a dramatic improvement of the patients respiratory failure Thereafter, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction performed on a preserved bronchial lavage sample tested positive, and thus his diagnosis was corrected to COVID19 pneumonia It is difficult to discriminate COVID19 pneumonia from druginduced lung disease, as both disorders can present similar groundglass opacities on computed tomography Therefore, with this presented case, we summarize our experience with steroid therapy for COVID19 associated respiratory distress at our institution,Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is an infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus, SARSCoV2, that appeared in late 2019 generating a high number of deaths and socioeconomic issues in human society One of the fundamental questions in social studies of science is to analyze the evolution of new research fields during environmental threats, such as COVID19 global pandemic crisis This study analyzes the emergence and evolution of the research field of COVID19 compared to other scientific fields concerning respiratory disorders, such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease COPD and Lung Cancer, to explain the dynamics of science that is generating scientific breakthroughs in a short period of time This study shows that the scientific production of the research field of COVID19 has increased from January 2020 with an unparalleled velocity generating manifold scientific advances, discoveries and innovative drugs for a paradigm shift in the treatment of infectious diseases with mRNA vaccines In particular, results reveal that acceleration of science in the research field of COVID19, measured with scientific production, is equal to a growth of 171 daily, which is a level much higher than evolution of a normal research field that has a growth of scientific production of about 05 daily eg, COPD and Lung Cancer These findings are generalized in properties of the dynamics of science to explain the characteristics of science that generate scientific breakthrough in the presence of environmental threats Overall, then, this study clarifies, as far as possible, some novel characteristics of the origin of new research fields, crisisdriven, that support discoveries and innovations for guiding scientific and technological progress in society,Immune thrombocytopenia ITP may occur following a viral infection We report the case of a 30yearold woman with thrombocytopenia who was subsequently diagnosed with ITP Although she was asymptomatic, chest computed tomography CT showed groundglass opacities in the lower lung regions The patient had a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 realtime polymerase chain reaction RTPCR test She responded well to 400 mgkg of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy Coronavirus disease of 2019 or COVID19 should be considered as a cause of ITP during the pandemic, and chest CT scans and RTPCR tests should be performed in patients suspected of ITP,Background Infection caused by SARSCoV2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 exhibits a strong infectivity but less virulence compared to severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS and the Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS In terms of cardiovascular morbidity, susceptible population include elderly and patients with certain cardiovascular conditions This infection has been associated with cardiac injury, cardiovascular complications and higher mortalityObjectives The main objective of the CARDIO COVID 1920 Registry is to determine the presence of cardiovascular comorbidities and cardiovascular complications in COVID19 infected patients that required inhospital treatment in different Latin American institutionsMethods The CARDIO COVID 1920 Registry is an observational, multicenter, ambispective, and hospitalbased registry of patients with confirmed COVID19 infection who required inhospital treatment in Latin America Enrollment of patients started on May 01, 2020 and was initially planned to last three months based on the progression of pandemic in Latin America, enrollment was extended until December 2020, and could be extended once again based on the pandemic course in our continent at that momentConclusions The CARDIO COVID 1920 Registry will characterize the inhospital population diagnosed with COVID19 in Latin America in order to identify risk factors for worsening of cardiovascular comorbidities or for the appearance of cardiovascular complications during hospitalization and during the 30day follow up period,The most commonly reported symptoms by patients affected by coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 are fatigue, fever, and respiratory distress However, other major changes observed in COVID19 patients such as high blood pressure, thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism seem to suggest that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 is targeting the endothelium, one of the largest organs in the human body This chapter reports on the role of the endothelium as a target of SARSCoV2,,Atherosclerosis is one of the main causes of cardiovascular events, namely, myocardium infarction and cerebral stroke, responsible for a great number of deaths every year worldwide This pathology is caused by the progressive accumulation of lowdensity lipoproteins, cholesterol, and other substances on the arterial wall, narrowing its lumen To date, many hemodynamic studies have been conducted experimentally andor numerically however, this disease is not yet fully understood For this reason, the research of this pathology is still ongoing, mainly, resorting to computational methods These have been increasingly used in biomedical research of atherosclerosis because of their highperformance hardware and software Taking into account the attempts that have been made in computational techniques to simulate realistic conditions of blood flow in both diseased and healthy arteries, the present review aims to give an overview of the most recent numerical studies focused on coronary arteries, by addressing the blood viscosity models, and applied physiological flow conditions In general, regardless of the boundary conditions, numerical studies have been contributed to a better understanding of the development of this disease, its diagnosis, and its treatment,Lung function impairment persists in 55 of critical COVID19 patients three months after ICU discharge Patient lung function, exercise capacity, radiologic, and quality of life data suggest impairment is related to radiologic lung involvement at admission,Graphical Abstract  Graphical abstractImpact of the COVID19 pandemic on patients with cardiovascular disease worldwideACS, acute coronary syndrome CV, cardiovascular HF, heart failure ICD, implantable cardioverterdefibrillator,Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ACE2 is the putative functional receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 Current literature on the abundance and distribution of ACE2 protein in the human respiratory tract is controversial We examined the effect of age and lung injury on ACE2 protein expression in rodent and nonhuman primate NHP models We also examined ACE2 expression in human tissues with and without coronavirus disease 19 COVID19 ACE2 expression was detected at very low levels in preterm, but was absent in fullterm and adult NHP lung homogenates This pattern of ACE2 expression contrasted with that of transmembrane protease serine type 2 TMPRSS2, which was significantly increased in fullterm newborn and adult NHP lungs compared to preterm NHP lungs ACE2 expression was not detected in NHP lungs with cigarette smokeinduced airway disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia Murine lungs lacked basal ACE2 immunoreactivity, but responded to hyperoxia, bacterial infection, and allergen exposure with new ACE2 expression in bronchial epithelial cells In human specimens, robust ACE2 immunoreactivity was detected in ciliated epithelial cells in paranasal sinus specimens, while ACE2 expression was detected only in rare type 2 alveolar epithelial cells in control lungs In autopsy specimens from patients with COVID19 pneumonia, ACE2 was detected in rare ciliated epithelial and endothelial cells in the trachea, but not in the lung There was robust expression of ACE2 expression in F344N rat nasal mucosa and lung specimens, which authentically recapitulated the ACE2 expression pattern in human paranasal sinus specimens Thus, ACE2 protein expression demonstrates a significant gradient between upper and lower respiratory tract in humans and is scarce in the lung This pattern of ACE2 expression supports the notion of sinonasal epithelium being the main entry site for SARSCoV2 but raises further questions on the pathogenesis and cellular targets of SARSCoV2 in COVID19 pneumonia,Mortality among patients with COVID19 and respiratory failure is high and there are no known lower airway biomarkers that predict clinical outcome We investigated whether bacterial respiratory infections and viral load were associated with poor clinical outcome and host immune tone We obtained bacterial and fungal culture data from 589 critically ill subjects with COVID19 requiring mechanical ventilation On a subset of the subjects that underwent bronchoscopy, we also quantified SARSCoV2 viral load, analyzed the microbiome of the lower airways by metagenome and metatranscriptome analyses and profiled the host immune response We found that isolation of a hospitalacquired respiratory pathogen was not associated with fatal outcome However, poor clinical outcome was associated with enrichment of the lower airway microbiota with an oral commensal  Mycoplasma salivarium , while high SARSCoV2 viral burden, poor antiSARSCoV2 antibody response, together with a unique host transcriptome profile of the lower airways were most predictive of mortality Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that 1 the extent of viral infectivity drives mortality in severe COVID19, and therefore 2 clinical management strategies targeting viral replication and host responses to SARSCoV2 should be prioritized,Contaminated aerosols and micro droplets are easily generated by infected hosts through sneezing, coughing, speaking and breathing 13 and harm humans health and the global economy While most of the efforts are usually targeted towards protecting individuals from getting infected, 4 eliminating transmissions from infection sources is also important to prevent disease transmission Supportive therapies for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 SARS CoV2 pneumonia such as oxygen supplementation, nebulizers and noninvasive mechanical ventilation all carry an increased risk for viral transmission via aerosol to healthcare workers 59 In this work, we study the efficacy of five methods for selfcontaining aerosols emitted from infected subjects undergoing nebulization therapies with a diverse spectrum on oxygen delivery therapies The work includes five study cases Case I Use of a FullFace Mask with biofilter in bilevel positive airway pressure device BPAP therapy, Case II Use of surgical mask in High Flow Nasal Cannula HFNC therapy, Case III Use of a modified silicone disposable mask in a HFNC therapy, Case IV Use of a modified silicone disposable mask with a regular nebulizer and normal breathing, Case V Use of a mitigation box with biofilter in a NonInvasive Positive Pressure Ventilator NIPPV We demonstrate that while cases I, III and IV showed efficacies of 98100 cases II and V , which are the most commonly used, resulted with significantly lower efficacies of 1024 to mitigate the dispersion of nebulization aerosols Therefore, implementing cases I, III and IV in health care facilities may help battle the contaminations and infections via aerosol transmission during a pandemic,To the editorThe corona virus 2019 COVID19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 SARSCoV2, as of October 2020, has affected more than 35 million people worldw,The benefits of remote ischaemic conditioning RIC have been difficult to translate to humans, when considering traditional outcome measures, such as mortality and heart failure This paper reviews the recent literature of the antiinflammatory effects of RIC, with a particular focus on the innate immune response and cytokine inhibition Given the current COVID19 pandemic, the inflammatory hypothesis of cardiac protection is an attractive target on which to repurpose such novel therapies A PubMedMEDLINE™ search was performed on July 13th 2020, for the key terms RIC, cytokines, the innate immune system and inflammation Data suggest that RIC attenuates inflammation in animals by immune conditioning, cytokine inhibition, cell survival and the release of antiinflammatory exosomes It is proposed that RIC inhibits cytokine release via a reduction in nuclear factor kappa beta NFκBmediated NLRP3 inflammasome production In vivo, RIC attenuates proinflammatory cytokine release in myocardialcerebral infarction and LPS models of endotoxaemia In the latter group, cytokine inhibition is associated with a profound survival benefit Further clinical trials should establish whether the benefits of RIC in inflammation can be observed in humans Moreover, we must consider whether uncomplicated MI and elective surgery are the most suitable clinical conditions in which to test this hypothesis,,The coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic is an evolving condition in the absence of established treatment and vaccines The few autopsy studies on COVID19 patients suggested the presence of pulmonary microvascular thrombosis Hence, it is imperative to understand the pathobiology of thrombus formation and speculate the therapeutic goals in combating COVID19 This paper focuses on a holistic approach by integrating the previous concepts and current concepts of thrombosis to better understand the pathogenesis of thrombosis,BACKGROUND Most data regarding the association between the glycemic index and cardiovascular disease come from highincome Western populations, with little information from nonWestern countries with low or middle incomes To fill this gap, data are needed from a large, geographically diverse population METHODS This analysis includes 137,851 participants between the ages of 35 and 70 years living on five continents, with a median followup of 95 years We used countryspecific foodfrequency questionnaires to determine dietary intake and estimated the glycemic index and glycemic load on the basis of the consumption of seven categories of carbohydrate foods We calculated hazard ratios using multivariable Cox frailty models The primary outcome was a composite of a major cardiovascular event cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure or death from any cause RESULTS In the study population, 8780 deaths and 8252 major cardiovascular events occurred during the followup period After performing extensive adjustments comparing the lowest and highest glycemicindex quintiles, we found that a diet with a high glycemic index was associated with an increased risk of a major cardiovascular event or death, both among participants with preexisting cardiovascular disease hazard ratio, 151 95 confidence interval CI, 125 to 182 and among those without such disease hazard ratio, 121 95 CI, 111 to 134 Among the components of the primary outcome, a high glycemic index was also associated with an increased risk of death from cardiovascular causes The results with respect to glycemic load were similar to the findings regarding the glycemic index among the participants with cardiovascular disease at baseline, but the association was not significant among those without preexisting cardiovascular disease CONCLUSIONS In this study, a diet with a high glycemic index was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and death Funded by the Population Health Research Institute and others,Background SARScoronavirus2 causes coronavirus

bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage BAL and a variety of available noninvasive studies, which include newer molecular markers for detecting a variety of infectious agents OBJECTIVE The objective of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic yield of BAL among HSCT patients relative to the yield of noninvasive testing METHOD This is a retrospective analysis of HSCT recipients who underwent both BAL and noninvasive testing at a cancer center in 2013 and 2014 RESULTS There were 210 diagnostic results among 98 HSCT recipients There were 84 unique findings on noninvasive testing that were not evident on BAL, and 36 unique findings on BAL that were not evident on noninvasive testing Noninvasive testing tended to yield bacterial and viral infections more commonly, while BAL yielded mycobacterial isolates more commonly CONCLUSION While both noninvasive testing and BAL are helpful in this population, each appeared more precise than the other with individual lung diseases Bronchoscopy with BAL and noninvasive testing should be considered complementary strategies in the workup of pulmonary complications among HSCT patients,,Developing, regenerating, and repairing a lung all require interstitial resident fibroblasts iReFs to direct the behavior of the epithelial stem cell niche During lung development, distal lung fibroblasts, in the form of matrix, myo, and lipofibroblasts, form the extra cellular matrix ECM, create tensile strength, and support distal epithelial differentiation, respectively During de novo septation in a murine pneumonectomy lung regeneration model, developmental processes are reactivated within the iReFs, indicating progenitor function well into adulthood In contrast to the regenerative activation of fibroblasts upon acute injury, chronic injury results in fibrotic activation In murine lung fibrosis models, fibroblasts can pathologically differentiate into lineages beyond their normal commitment during homeostasis In lung injury, recently defined alveolar niche cells support the expansion of alveolar epithelial progenitors to regenerate the epithelium In human fibrotic lung diseases like bronchopulmonary dysplasia BPD, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis IPF, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD, dynamic changes in matrix, myo, lipofibroblasts, and alveolar niche cells suggest differential requirements for injury pathogenesis and repair In this review, we summarize the role of alveolar fibroblasts and their activation stage in alveolar septation and regeneration and incorporate them into the context of human lung disease, discussing fibroblast activation stages and how they contribute to BPD, IPF, and COPD,It is to be feared that the great vulnerability of patients with cardiovascular diseases to the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic will further heighten the already enormous burden of morbidity and mortality of heart failure Many of the clinical trials published in 2020 show the favorable effects of innovative treatment principles For the treatment of systolic heart insufficiency heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, HFrEF sodiumglucose cotransporterxa02 SGLT2

for the management of chronic hypertension have been published in the last 3 years by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ACOG, The American College of Cardiology ACC, The American Heart Association AHA, and the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy ISSHP The authors compiled this work to review the evidence supporting these new guidelines and to provide critiques on areas that need further research,BackgroundRespiratory failure due to COVID19 pneumonia is associated with high mortality and may overwhelm health care systems, due to the surgexa0of patients requiring advanced respiratory support Shortage of intensive care unit ICU beds required many patients to be treated outside the ICU despite severe gas exchange impairment Helmet is an effective interface to provide continuous positive airway pressure CPAP noninvasively We report data about the usefulness of helmet CPAP during pandemic, either as  treatment, a bridge to intubation or a rescue therapy for patients with care limitations DNI MethodsIn this observational study we collected data regarding patients failing standard oxygen therapy ie, nonrebreathing mask due to COVID19 pneumonia treated with a free flow helmet CPAP system Patients data were recorded before, at initiation of CPAP treatment and once a day, thereafter CPAP failure was defined as a composite outcome of intubation or deathResultsA total of 306 patients were included 42 were deemed as DNI Helmet CPAP treatment was successful in 69 of the full treatment and 28 of the DNI patients P,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 that causes coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 binds to the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2 to gain cellular entry Akt inhibitor triciribine TCBN has demonstrated promising results in promoting recovery from advancedstage acute lung injury in preclinical studies In the current study, we tested the direct effect of TCBN on ACE2 expression in human bronchial H441 and lung alveolar A549 epithelial cells Treatment with TCBN resulted in the downregulation of both messenger RNA and protein levels of ACE2 in A549 cells Since HMGB1 plays a vital role in the inflammatory response in COVID19, and because hyperglycemia has been linked to increased COVID19 infections, we determined if HMGB1 and hyperglycemia have any effect on ACE2 expression in lung epithelial cells and whether TCBN has any effect on reversing HMGB1 and hyperglycemiainduced ACE2 expression We observed increased ACE2 expression with both HMGB1 and hyperglycemia treatment in A549 as well as H441 cells, which were blunted by TCBN treatment Our findings from this study, combined with our previous reports on the potential benefits of TCBN in the treatment of acute lung injury, generate reasonable optimism on the potential utility of TCBN in the therapeutic management of patients with COVID19,In 2020 declared the COVID19 pandemic A new SARSCov2 betacoronavirus transmitted through respiratory secretions of infected people, causing lesions in the pulmonary microvasculature, endothelial activation, massive release of proinflammatory substances cytokine storm, which lead to a procoagulant state and on which it will depend the development of the serious disease The management of coagulopathy induced by COVID19 entails stratifying the risk of thrombosis, for which heparins are the treatment of choice, especially in hospitalized patients Low molecular weight heparin LMWH is the first option since its administration implies longer times and less exposure of health personnel Unfractionated heparin is another alternative but requires laboratory controls and is sometimes not available Heparininduced thrombocytopenia HIT and bleeding are serious adverse events secondary to the use of heparin anticoagulation,OBJECTIVE To extract pulmonary and cardiovascular metrics from chest CTs of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 using

general ward, and group 3 intensive care unit ICU Multiple pulmonary and cardiovascular metrics were extracted from the chest CT images using deep learning Additionally, six laboratory findings indicating inflammation and cellular damage were considered Differences in CT metrics, laboratory findings, and demographics between the patient management groups were assessed The potential of these parameters to predict patients needs for intensive care yesno was analyzed using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curves Internal and external validity were assessed using 109 independent chest CT scans RESULTS While demographic parameters alone sex and age were not sufficient to predict ICU management status, both CT metrics alone including both pulmonary and cardiovascular metrics area under the curve AUC  088 95 confidence interval CI  079097 and laboratory findings alone Creactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, white blood cell count, and albumin AUC  086 95 CI  077094 were good classifiers Excellent performance was achieved by a combination of demographic parameters, CT metrics, and laboratory findings AUC  091 95 CI  085098 Application of a model that combined both pulmonary CT metrics and demographic parameters on a dataset from another hospital indicated its external validity AUC  077 95 CI  066088 CONCLUSION Chest CT of patients with COVID19 contains valuable information that can be accessed using automated image analysis These metrics are useful for the prediction of patient management,Background The novel coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is a highly infectious and pandemic disease with a variable mode of action Patients with underlying illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension, and other diseases are more prone to infection An understanding of the different comorbidities that place patients at the highest risk of COVID19 pneumonia and other fatal complications associated with COVID19 is necessary for healthcare professionals This study aimed to determine the frequency of different comorbid illnesses among COVID19 patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan Methodology All patients diagnosed with COVID19 who required admission for the care of their symptoms were included in this observational, crosssectional study conducted from May 1 to July 30, 2020 The patients were treated at a specialized COVID19 isolation ward built at the Dow University of Health Sciences at the Ojha campus The patients were referred from the emergency department, medical and allied wards, and COVID19 screening units A detailed history and clinical examination were performed, and comorbidities were evaluated Results A total of 212 patients were admitted during the study with a mean age of 52  16 years The study population consisted of 120 566 males and 92 4339 females, and the most common comorbidities were uncontrolled diabetes with hypertension n  56 264, controlled diabetes n  22 1037, obstructive airway disease n  16 75, and interstitial lung disease n  14 66 A total of 48 2264 patients had no comorbidities Conclusions Most COVID19positive patients with pneumonia were male, and common comorbidities included uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension, and obstructive and restrictive lung disease The presence of comorbidities was associated with a marked increase in the risk of morbidity and mortality Further studies are warranted to confirm these findings,Objectives COVID19 is an infectious disease that started spreading globally at the end of 2019 Due to differences in patient characteristics and symptoms in different regions, in this research, a comparative study was performed on COVID19 patients in 6 provinces of Iran Also, multilayer perceptron MLP neural network and Logistic Regression LR models were applied for the diagnosis of COVID19 Methods A total of 1043 patients with suspected COVID19 infection in Iran participated in this study 29 characteristics, symptoms and underlying disease were obtained from hospitalized patients Afterwards, we compared the obtained data between confirmed cases Furthermore, the data was applied for building the ANN and LR models to diagnosis the infected patients by COVID19 Results In 750 confirmed patients, Common symptoms were fever  375°C, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, chills and headache The most common underlying diseases were hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and coronary heart disease Finally, the accuracy of the ANN model to the diagnosis of COVID19 infection was higher than the LR model Conclusions The prevalent symptoms and underlying diseases of COVID19 patients were similar in different provinces, but the incidence of symptoms was significantly different from each other Also, the study demonstrated that ANN and LR models have a high ability in the diagnosis of COVID19 infection,BACKGROUND The risk of ventricular arrhythmias in patients on QT prolonging drugs is indicated to be increased early after cardioversion CV of atrial fibrillation AF to sinus rhythm SR Sotalol, used to prevent AF relapse, prolongs cardiac repolarization and corrected QT interval QTc A pronounced QTc prolongation is an established marker of proarrhythmias Our objective was to use novel technique to quantify and evaluate the diurnal variation of the QTc interval after elective CV to SR in patients on sotalol or metoprolol METHODS Fifty patients underwent twelvelead Holter recording for 24xa0hr after elective CV for persistent AF All patients had the highest tolerable stable dose of sotalol nxa0xa027 or metoprolol nxa0xa023 Measurements of QT and RR intervals were performed on all valid beats RESULTS A clear diurnal variation of both HR and QTc was seen in both groups, more pronounced in patients on sotalol, where a high percentage of heartbeats with QTc 500xa0ms was observed, especially at night Six patients 22 on sotalol but none on metoprolol had 20 of all heart beats within the 24hour recording with QTc 500xa0ms CONCLUSION Twentyfourhour Holter recordings with QTmeasurement immediately after CV demonstrated that one in five patients on sotalol had 20 of all heart beats with prolonged QTc 500xa0ms, especially during nighttime The QTc diurnal variation was retained in patients on βblockade or a potent class III antiarrhythmic drug with βblocking properties,,Bronchial thermoplasty BT is a treatment for moderatetosevere asthma which generally improves qualityoflife scores but not conventional measures of lung function Newer methodologies have begun to demonstrate the underlying physiological changes and elucidate the mechanism of action We postulated that systematic, CTbased assessment of the response of individual airways to BT is feasible, and our aim was to determine the distribution of these responses and the relationship with airway size Twenty patients meeting the ERSATS definition of severe asthma underwent BT and assessment including CT, Asthma Control Questionnaire ACQ, and spirometry Treatment was structured so that the left and right lungs are treated sequentially with a midtreatment assessment providing an internal control Pairs of CT scans were analysed using a new semiautomatic processing algorithm which matched individual segmented airways for quantitative comparison Crosssectional airway lumen area from matched airway pairs in treated lungs increased on average by 64 after BT p002 but showed no change in the untreated lung Matched airway length was also unchanged Breakdown by airway size showed amplified response in more distal airways, with the smallest quintile of measured airways dilating by 132 p0001 ACQ improved from 3509 to 1912 p0001 These data show that the response to BT in individual airways can be assessed by CT and that dilation is heterogeneous and predominant in distal compared with proximal airways A CTbased approach may further our understanding of the physiological changes in BT and aid in the development of refined and personalised versions of the therapy,BACKGROUND Asthma patients are comparatively susceptible to respiratory viral infections and more likely to develop severe symptoms than people without asthma During the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic, it is necessary to adequately evaluate the characteristics and outcomes of the asthma population in the COVID19 tested and diagnosed population OBJECTIVE We performed a study to assess the impact of asthma on COVID19 diagnosis, presenting symptoms, disease severity, and cytokine profiles METHODS This was an analysis of a prospectively collected cohort of patients suspected of having COVID19 who presented for COVID19 testing at a tertiary medical center in Missouri, USA between March and September 2020 We classified and analyzed patients according to their preexisting asthma diagnosis and subsequent COVID19 testing results RESULTS COVID19 suspected patients n435 were enrolled in this study The proportion of patients testing positive for COVID19 was 692 and 819 in the asthma and nonasthma groups respectively The frequency of relevant symptoms are similar between asthma groups with positive and negative COVID19 test results In the COVID19 diagnosed population n343, asthma was not associated with several indicators of COVID19 severity, including hospitalization, admission to an intensive care unit ICU, mechanical ventilation, death due to COVID19, and inhospital mortality after multivariate adjustment COVID19 patients with asthma exhibited significantly lower levels of plasma interleukin IL8 compared to patients without asthma adjusted p0023 CONCLUSION The asthma population is facing a challenge in preliminary COVID19 evaluation due to overlap in symptoms of COVID19 and asthma However, asthma does not increase the risk of COVID19 severity if infected,With the continuation of the second wave of a novel coronavirus disease COVID19, which is likely to be even more devastating, there are several associated health problems COVID19 is usually mild and nonfatal in children However, in rare cases, children could severely be affected, and clinical manifestations may differ from adults A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children MISC is a rare but serious complication associated with COVID19, initiated by an overactive immune response in kids that usually hits weeks after exposure to the COVID19 MISC is a disorder in which inflammation could occur in different parts of the body The disease puts pressure on the heart, as blood vessels leading towards the heart get inflamed and incapable of carrying adequate blood, hence producing cardiac complications in children hospitalised with MISC The problem seems to be associated with COVID19 in children however, the association between MISC and COVID19 is still unidentified There is very little understanding of what triggers the MISC, which necessitates a rigorous mapping of the disease and associated risk elements for better disease management and navigating through this crisis,OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to explore differences in attitudes, behaviors and expectations related to COVID19 between physicians and patients with asthma METHODS An anonymous survey was distributed through email and social media to adult patients with asthma during a threeweek period in AprilMay 2020 A separate survey was sent to physicians The surveys asked about demographic information, specific challenges and concerns due to COVID19, and attitudesbehaviors during this time RESULTS A total of 1171 patients and 225 physicians completed the surveys Overall, patients with asthma and physicians had large differences in expectations related to COVID19 Patients were more likely than physicians to believe that individuals with asthma are at a higher risk to get COVID19 375 vs 120, p,The coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic is an evolving condition in the absence of established treatment and vaccines The few autopsy studies on COVID19 patients suggested the presence of pulmonary microvascular thrombosis Hence, it is imperative to understand the pathobiology of thrombus formation and speculate the therapeutic goals in combating COVID19 This paper focuses on a holistic approach by integrating the previous concepts and current concepts of thrombosis to better understand the pathogenesis of thrombosis,This study investigated an alternative homebased cardiac telerehabilitation model in consideration of the recommendations for the COVID19 quarantine of people diagnosed with coronary heart disease CHD We hypothesized that using a 200 m fast walking test 200 mFWT and telerehabilitation would create an effective alternative cardiac rehabilitation CR intervention that could improve cardiorespiratory fitness Participants n  19, mean age 604  96 of the 8week intervention performed regular physical exercise at the target heart rate zone determined by calculations based on the 200 mFWT results In our study, the participants were supervised using telerehabilitation A total of 84 of participants completed the 8week intervention No adverse events were reported during telerehabilitation The study participants noted a significant improvement p  0001 in cardiorespiratory fitness expressed by an 8 reduction in the walking test time Δ 88  59 s Homebased telerehabilitation based on 200 mFWT effectively increased the cardiorespiratory fitness in people with CHD with a low to moderate cardiovascular risk This was a novel approach in CR during the COVID19 pandemic As research in this area is justified, this paper may serve as an alternative method of providing healthcare during the COVID19 pandemic and as a basis for further upcoming randomized controlled trials,BACKGROUND The current Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 outbreak is associated with significant mortality, especially in patients suffering from end stage renal disease ESRD and hemodialysis patients Several previous studies reported an overrisk of arterial and venous thrombosis, in particular pulmonary embolism and venous thrombosis of catheter in COVID19 patients in intensive care unit However, arteriovenous fistula AVF thrombosis has rarely been reported yet in these patients AVF thrombosis is a serious complication that impacts significantly patients outcome Here, we aim to describe characteristics and prognosis of a cohort of COVID19 hemodialysis HD patients presenting with AVF thrombosis METHODS In the Ile de France region Paris area during the March 11thApril 30th 2020u2009period, fistula thrombosis cases were collected among COVID19 hemodialysis patients in seven dialysis units and in interventional vascular departments These patients characteristics were analyzed through a review of the patients medical records RESULTS Seventeen patients were included in our study median age 69u2009years Ten patients 59 were men Ten patients 59 were diabetic and 88 had a high blood pressure The mortality rate in these patients was 47 All thrombosis treated with a declotting procedures 64 were successfully cleared, but with early relapse in 36 CONCLUSION Our study highlights AVF thrombosis as a severe complication in COVID19 hemodialysis patients that contributed to the severity and accelerated death,Clinical manifestations of COVID19 patients are dominated by respiratory symptoms, but cardiac complications are commonly observed and associated with increased morbidity and mortality Underlying pathological mechanisms of cardiac injury are still not entirely elucidated, likely depending on a combination of direct viral damage with an uncontrolled immune activation Cardiac involvement in these patients ranges from a subtle myocardial injury to cardiogenic shock Advanced cardiac imaging plays a key role in discriminating the broad spectrum of differential diagnoses Present article aims to review the value of advanced multimodality imaging in patients with suspected SARSCoV2related cardiovascular involvement and its essential role in risk stratification and tailored treatment strategies Based on our experience, we also sought to suggest possible diagnostic algorithms for the rationale utilization of advanced imaging tools, such as cardiac CT and CMR, avoiding unnecessary examinations and diagnostic delays,,Introduction Bronchial carcinoid tumors are rare, slow growing, malignant neuroendocrine tumors which arise from Enterochromaffin Kulchitsky cells Early diagnosis is extremely important as the main stay of treatment is surgical excision Presentation of case We present a rare case of bronchial typical carcinoid tumor in a 27yearold male who presented with a complaint of intermittent dry cough of 2 weeks duration associated with shortness of breath and low grade fever He was initially misdiagnosed as covid19 pneumonia and was admitted to covid19 treatment center Right lung bilobectomy with regional lymph node resection was done and he was discharged home in good condition Discussion Majority of typical carcinoids are located in the central airways leading to bronchial obstruction with recurrent pneumonia, chest pain and wheezing In the era of covid19 pandemic, lung cancer patients are at higher risk of being affected by covid19 and, early identification and differential diagnosis is extremely difficult in the absence of comprehensive evaluation and work up as the clinical and imaging findings of covid19 may resemble lung cancer Although hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes are the most common metastatic sites for typical carcinoids most lymphadenopathies are caused by a reactive inflammatory reaction Conclusion Bronchial carcinoids are rare, malignant neuroendocrine tumors with complete surgical resection being the only curative management During the Covid19 pandemic crisis, diagnosing rare lung diseases like carcinoid tumor is real challenge especially in resource limited set up and needs high index of suspicion with meticulous diagnostic work up The outcome of typical carcinoids with lymph node metastasis is excellent with complete resection,PURPOSE Pulmonary embolism PE in COVID19 patients can play a key role in precipitating clinical conditions We aimed to evaluate PE distribution on CTA and to investigate any possible association with Ddimer DD, pulmonary stage of disease and prognosis METHOD COVID19 patients of two affiliated Hospitals, undergone a CTA examination for PE suspicion, were retrospectively enrolled Comorbidities, laboratory tests and clinical outcomes hospitalization, discharge, death were assessed A parenchymal stage early, progressive, peak, absorption for lung involvement was assigned RESULTS A cohort of 114 patients mean age 61 years 263  females with severe COVID19 pneumonia were evaluated At last followup 25 219  were hospitalized, 72 632  discharged, 17 149  dead Eightyeight patients 772  had at least one comorbidity, being cardiovascular ones the most frequent 447  CTA revealed PE in 65 patients 57 , with concomitant pulmonary trunk andor main arteries involvement in 169  PE defects were ubiquitous in 185  of cases The predominant parenchymal stages were the progressive 246  and peak 677  DD levels showed a significant correlation with PE occurrence and extent in pulmonary branches, despite anticoagulant therapies trend of correlation with pulmonary stages was also noted CONCLUSIONS PE is a frequent complication in severe COVID19 patients, particularly during central parenchymal stages and despite ongoing anticoagulant therapy CTA and DD levels play a crucial role in the assessment of suspected PE, despite anticoagulant therapies, along with proper information about lung involvement extent,Background The purpose of this study was to examine gender differences in authorship of manuscripts in select highimpact cardiology journals during the early coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic Methods and Results All manuscripts published between March 1, 2019 to June 1, 2019 and March 1, 2020 to June 1, 2020 in 4 highimpact cardiology journals Journal of the American College of Cardiology, Circulation, JAMA Cardiology, and European Heart Journal were identified using bibliometric data Authors genders were determined by matching first name with predicted gender using a validated multinational database Genderizeio and manual adjudication Proportions of women and men first, cofirst, senior, and cosenior authors, manuscript types, and whether the manuscript was COVID19 related were recorded In 2019, women were first authors of 176 223 manuscripts and senior authors of 99 150 manuscripts In 2020, women first authored 230 274 manuscripts and senior authored 138 193 manuscripts Proportions of woman first and senior authors were significantly higher in 2020 compared with 2019 Women were more likely to be first authors if the manuscripts senior author was a woman 338 for woman firstwoman senior versus 234 for woman firstman senior P0001 Women were less likely to be first authors of COVID19related original research manuscripts P004 Conclusions Representation of women as key authors of manuscripts published in major cardiovascular journals increased during the early COVID19 pandemic compared with similar months in 2019 However, women were significantly less likely to be first authors of COVID19related original research manuscripts Future investigation into the genderdisparate impacts of COVID19 on academic careers is critical,COVID19 is well known for its respiratory symptoms, but severe presentations can alter haemostasis, causing acute endorgan damage with poor outcomes Among its various neurological presentations, cerebrovascular events often present as smallvessel strokes Although uncommon, in predisposed individuals, largevessel occlusions LVOs can occur as a possible consequence of direct viral action viral burden or antigenic structure or virusinduced cytokine storm Subtle presentations and complicated stroke care pathways continue to exist, delaying timely care We present a unique case of COVID19 LVO manifesting as an acute confusional state in an elderly man in April 2020 CT angiography revealed de novo occlusions of the left internal carotid artery and proximal right vertebral artery, effectively blocking anterior and posterior circulations Delirium can lead to inaccurate stroke scale assessments and prolong initiation of COVID19 stroke care pathways Future studies are needed to look into the temporal relationship between confusion and neurological manifestations,We report a case of cardiac injury in a 46yearold man affected by COVID19 The patient presented with shortness of breath and fever ECG revealed sinus tachycardia with ventricular extrasystoles and Twave inversion in anterior leads Troponin T and Nterminal pro Btype natriuretic peptide were elevated Transthoracic echocardiography showed severely reduced systolic function with an estimated left ventricle ejection fraction of 30 A nasopharingeal swab was positive for SARSCoV2 On day 6, 11 days after onset of symptoms, the patient deteriorated clinically with new chest pain and type 1 respiratory failure Treatment with colchicine 05u2009mg 8hourly resulted in rapid clinical resolution This case report highlights how cardiac injury can dominate the clinical picture in COVID19 infection The role of colchicine therapy should be further studied to determine its usefulness in reducing myocardial and possibly lung parenchymal inflammatory responses,Neurological conditions are being more recognised in patients with COVID19, with encephalopathy being the most prevalent problem Posterior reversible encephalopathy is suspected to occur due to elevated blood pressure and overproduction of inflammatory markers, both of which have been reported in the setting of COVID19 infection Encephalopathy was the main presentation in this case, without respiratory dysfunction initially, and with imaging findings indicative of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome as an aetiology Followup imaging showed resolution of the abnormal results with mental status returning to baseline upon discharge,Pointofcare lung ultrasound LUS is an attractive alternative to chest Xray CXR, but its diagnostic accuracy compared to CXR has not been well studied in coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 patients We conducted a prospective observational study to assess the correlation between LUS and CXR findings in COVID19 patients Ninetysix patients with a clinical diagnosis of COVID19 underwent an LUS exam and CXR upon presentation Physicians blinded to the CXR findings performed all LUS exams Detection of pulmonary infiltrates by CXR versus LUS was compared between patients categorized as suspected or confirmed COVID19 based on reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction Sensitivities and correlation by Kappa statistic were calculated between LUS and CXR LUS detected pulmonary infiltrates more often than CXR in both suspected and confirmed COVID19 subjects The most common LUS abnormalities were discrete Blines, confluent Blines, and small subpleural consolidations Most important, LUS detected unilateral or bilateral pulmonary infiltrates in 55 of subjects with a normal CXR Substantial agreement was demonstrated between LUS and CXR for normal, unilateral or bilateral findings Κ  048 95 CI 034 to 063 In patients with suspected or confirmed COVID19, LUS detected pulmonary infiltrates more often than CXR, including more than half of the patients with a normal CXR,STUDY OBJECTIVES Like other medical branches, the practice of sleep medicine has been affected by the COVID19 pandemic however, the actual impact is not known This study was planned to assess the status of the practice of sleep medicine in India during the COVID19 pandemic and lockdown METHODS This was an online questionnairebased descriptive study A 25item questionnaire was developed to assess the functioning of sleep laboratories, use of telemedicine, and positive airway pressure therapy during the COVID19 pandemic in India The questionnaire was sent to the sleep physicians of two major sleep medicine societies of India Responses were analyzed RESULTS In this study, the response rate was 646 During this pandemic, 72 of physicians reported that they had closed sleep laboratory while 24 reported shifting to home sleep apnea testing Only half of the sleep physicians confirmed awareness of the disinfection guidelines proposed by AASM to prevent COVID19 infection in the sleep laboratory However, almost all of them reported taking preventive measures like the use of protective gear 61 of physicians advised mitigating strategies as a temporary measure to their patients of obstructive sleep apnea OSA 586 opined that autoPAP might be used for uncomplicated OSA without diagnostic polysomnography during the pandemic 84 of physicians reported that they were continuing their services through telemedicine facility Physicians reported that consultations for insomnia and circadian rhythm sleep disorders increased during the pandemic CONCLUSIONS Sleep laboratories were reportedly closed during the COVID19 pandemic, and most of the sleep physicians were providing services through telemedicine The majority reported that autoPAP without diagnostic polysomnography could be an effective option for uncomplicated OSA Consultation for insomnia and circadian rhythm sleep disorders reportedly increased during the lockdown,OBJECTIVES Recent reports suggest a high prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in COVID19 patients, but the role of cardiovascular disease CVD risk factors in the clinical course of COVID19 is unknown We evaluated the timetoevent relationship between hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes and COVID19 outcomes DESIGN We analysed data from the prospective Dutch CovidPredict cohort, an ongoing prospective study of patients admitted for COVID19 infection SETTING Patients from eight participating hospitals, including two university hospitals from the CovidPredict cohort were included PARTICIPANTS Admitted, adult patients with a positive COVID19 PCR or high suspicion based on CTimaging of the thorax Patients were followed for major outcomes during the hospitalisation CVD risk factors were established via home medication lists and divided in antihypertensives, lipidlowering therapy and antidiabetics PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES MEASURES The primary outcome was mortality during the first 21 days following admission, secondary outcomes consisted of intensive care unit ICU admission and ICU mortality KaplanMeier and Cox regression analyses were used to determine the association with CVD risk factors RESULTS We included 1604 patients with a mean age of 6615 of whom 605 were men Antihypertensives, lipidlowering therapy and antidiabetics were used by 45, 347 and 221 of patients After 21days of followup 192 of the patients had died or were discharged for palliative care Cox regression analysis after adjustment for age and sex showed that the presence of 2u2009risk factors was associated with increased mortality risk HR 152, 95u2009CI 115 to 202, but not with ICU admission Moreover, the use of 2 antidiabetics and 2 antihypertensives was associated with mortality independent of age and sex with HRs of, respectively, 209 95 CI 155 to 280 and 146 95 CI 111 to 191 CONCLUSIONS The accumulation of hypertension, dyslipidaemia and diabetes leads to a stepwise increased risk for shortterm mortality in hospitalised COVID19 patients independent of age and sex Further studies investigating how these risk factors disproportionately affect COVID19 patients are warranted,BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is an infectious disease characterized by cough, fever, and fatigue and 20 of cases will develop into severe conditions resulting from acute lung injury with the manifestation of the acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS that accounts for more than 50 of mortality Currently, it has been reported that some comorbidities are linked with an increased rate of severity and mortality among COVID19 patients To assess the role of comorbidity in COVID19 progression, we performed a systematic review with a metaanalysis on the relationship of COVID19 severity with 8 different underlying diseasesMethodsPubMed, Web of Science, and CNKI were searched for articles investigating the prevalence of comorbidities in severe and nonsevere COVID19 patients A total of 41 studies comprising 12,526 patients were includedResultsPrevalence of some commodities was lower than that in general population such as hypertension 19 vs 232, diabetes 9 vs 109, chronic kidney disease CKD 2 vs 95, chronic liver diseases CLD 3 vs 248 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD 3 vs 86, while some others including cancer 1 vs 06, cardiovascular disease 6 vs 18 and cerebrovascular disease 2 vs 09 exhibited greater percentage in COVID19 Cerebrovascular disease ORu2009u2009370, 95CI 251545 was found to be the strongest risk factor in disease exacerbation, followed by CKD ORu2009u2009360, 95CI 218594, COPD ORu2009u2009314, 95 CI 235419, cardiovascular disease ORu2009u2009276, 95 CI 218349, malignancy ORu2009u2009263, 95 CI 175395, diabetes ORu2009u2009249, 95 CI 210296 and hypertension ORu2009u2009213, 95 CI 181251 We found no correlation between CLD and increased disease severity ORu2009u2009132, 95 CI 096182ConclusionThe impact of all eight underlying diseases on COVID19 deterioration seemed to be higher in patients outside Hubei Based on different comorbidities, COVID19 patients tend to be at risk of developing poor outcomes to a varying degree Thus, tailored infection prevention and monitoring and treatment strategies targeting these highrisk subgroups might improve prognosis during the COVID19 pandemic,OBJECTIVE There are varying reports of the prevalence and effect of comorbid asthma in coronavirus disease2019 COVID19 patients We sought to conduct a metaanalysis comparing asthmatic and nonasthmatic patients to determine the clinical significance of preexisting asthma in COVID19 patients DATA SOURCES Online databases PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and Scopus, were searched up to July 15, 2020, for papers comparing asthma versus nonasthma COVID19 patients STUDY SELECTION According to prespecified inclusion criteria, this analysis included eleven retrospective studies with 107,983 COVID19 patients Subgroup analysis was performed based on age groups RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 599u2009years 95CI  519679 Across studies, the prevalence of asthma was 112 95CI 91133 among COVID19 patients who attended the hospitals Asthma patients were more likely to be younger SMD  036, 95CI  061 to 010, pu2009u20090005, and obese OR  198, 95CI  154255, p,Background Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is triggered by emotional or physical stress It is defined as a reversible myocardial dysfunction, usually with apical ballooning aspect due to apical akinesia associated with hyperkinetic basal left ventricular contraction Described in cases of viral infections such as influenza, only few have been reported associated with novel coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 in the recent pandemic Case summary A 79yearsold man, with cardiovascular risk factors type 2 diabetes and hypertension and chronic kidney disease, presented to the emergency room for severe dyspnea after 8 days of presenting respiratory symptoms and fever Baseline electrocardiogram ECG was normal, but he presented marked inflammatory syndrome He was transferred to an intensive care unit to receive mechanical ventilation within 6 h, due to acute respiratory distress syndrome He presented circulatory failure 2 days after, requiring norepinephrine support up to up to 104 μgkgmin Troponin T was elevated 637 ngl ECG showed diffuse T wave inversion Echocardiography showed reduced left ventricular ejection fraction LVEF 40, with visual signs of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy Cardiac failure resolved after 24 h with troponin T decrease 433 ngl and restoration of cardiac function LVEF 60 with regression of Takotsubo features Patient died after 15 days of ICU admission, due to septic shock from ventilatoracquired pneumonia Cardiac function was then normal Conclusion Mechanisms of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in viral infections include catecholamineinduced myocardial toxicity and inflammation related to sepsis Differential diagnoses include myocarditis and myocardial infarction Evidence of the benefit of immunomodulatory drugs and dexamethasone are growing to support this hypothesis in COVID19,BACKGROUND AND AIMS Retrospective studies have shown that angiotensinconvertingenzyme ACE inhibitors are associated with a reduced risk of complications and mortality in persons with novel coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 Thus, we aimed to examine the efficacy of ramipril, an ACEinhibitor, in preventing ICU admission, mechanical ventilation andor mortality while also minimizing the risk of transmission and use of personal protective equipment PPE METHODS RAMIC is a multicenter, randomized, doubleblind, allocationconcealed, placebocontrolled trial comparing the efficacy of treatment with ramipril 25xa0mg orally daily compared to placebo for 14xa0days The study population includes adult patients with COVID19 who were admitted to a hospital or assessed in an emergency department or ambulatory clinic Key exclusion criteria include ICU admission or need for mechanical ventilation at screening, use of an ACE inhibitor or angiotensinreceptorII blocker within 7xa0days, glomerular filtration rate,An important manifestation of severe COVID19 is the ARDSlike lung injury that is associated with vascular endothelialitis, thrombosis, and angiogenesis The intravascular innate immune system IIIS, including the complement, contact, coagulation, and fibrinolysis systems, which is crucial for recognizing and eliminating microorganisms and debris in the body, is likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of COVID19 ARDS Biomarkers for IIIS activation were studied in the first 66 patients with COVID19 admitted to the ICU in Uppsala University Hospital, both crosssectionally on day 1 and in 19 patients longitudinally for up to a month, in a prospective study IIIS analyses were compared with biochemical parameters and clinical outcome and survival Blood cascade systems activation leading to an overreactive conjunct thromboinflammation was demonstrated, reflected in consumption of individual cascade system components, eg, FXII, prekallikrein, and high molecular weight kininogen and in increased levels of activation products, eg, C4d, C3a, C3d,g, sC5b9, TAT, and Ddimer Strong associations were found between the blood cascade systems and organ damage, illness severity scores, and survival We show that critically ill COVID19 patients display a conjunct activation of the IIIS that is linked to organ damage of the lung, heart, kidneys, and death We present evidence that the complement and in particular the kallikreinkinin system is strongly activated and that both systems are prognostic markers of the outcome of the patients suggesting their role in driving the inflammation Already licensed kallikreinkinin inhibitors are potential drugs for treatment of critically ill patients with COVID19,BackgroundThe most important target cell of SARSCoV2xa0is Type II pneumocyte which produces and secretes pulmonary surfactant PS that prevents alveolar collapse PS instillation therapy is dramatically effective for infant respiratory distress syndrome but has been clinically ineffective for ARDS Nowadays, ARDS is regarded as noncardiogenic pulmonary edema with vascular hyperpermeability regardless of direct relation to PS dysfunction However, there is a possibility that this ineffectiveness of PS instillation for ARDS is caused by insufficient delivery Then, we performed PS instillation simulation with realistic human airway models by the use of computational fluid dynamics, and investigated how instilled PS would move in the liquid layer covering the airway wall and reach to alveolar regionsMethodsTwo types of 3D human airway models were prepared one was from the trachea to the lobular bronchi and the other was from a subsegmental bronchus to respiratory bronchioles The thickness of the liquid layer covering the airway was assigned as 14u2009 of the inner radius of the airway segment The liquid layer was assumed to be replaced by an instilled PS The flow rate of the instilled PS was assigned a constant value, which was determined by the total amount and instillation time in clinical use The PS concentration of the liquid layer during instillation was computed by solving the advectivediffusion equationResultsThe driving pressure from the trachea to respiratory bronchioles was calculated at 317 cmH2O, which is about 20 times of a standard value in conventional PS instillation method where the driving pressure was given by difference between inspiratory and endexpiratory pressures of a ventilator It means that almost all PS does not reach the alveolar regions but moves to and fro within the airway according to the change in ventilator pressure The driving pressure from subsegmental bronchus was calculated at 273xa0cm H2O, that is clinically possible by wedge instillation under bronchoscopic observationConclusionsThe simulation study has revealed that selective wedge instillation under bronchoscopic observation should be tried for COVID19 pneumonia before the onset of ARDS It will be also useful for preventing secondary lung fibrosis,,,,,,The purpose of this review is to highlight the most impactful, educational, and frequently downloaded articles published in the Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography JCCT for the year 2020 The JCCT reached new records in 2020 for the number of research submissions, published manuscripts, article downloads and social media impressions The articles in this review were selected by the Editorial Board of the JCCT and are comprised predominately of original research publications in the following categories Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19, coronary artery disease, coronary physiology, structural heart disease, and technical advances The Editorial Board would like to thank each of the authors, peerreviewers and the readers of JCCT for making 2020 one of the most successful years in its history, despite the challenging circumstances of the global COVID19 pandemic,Approximately 56 of patients diagnosed to have COVID19 infection present with severe hypoxemia requiring invasive ventilation or noninvasive ventilation NIV Additional oxygen to patients on NIV can be given by nasal prong or by connecting oxygen tubing directly to the O2 pickoff port of the NIV mask or by connecting oxygen tubing to the singlelimb circuit in between ventilator and patient Dual oxygen therapy improves oxygenation in COVID19 patients on NIV This method may make the patient more comfortable, increase tolerance to NIV, increase the usefulness of NIV for moderate and severe COVID19 acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS How to cite this article Kumar A, Kumar A, Sinha C, Kumar N, Singh K, Singh PK Dual Oxygen Therapy in COVID19 Patient A Method to Improve Oxygenation Indian J Crit Care Med 2021252231233,Pathological findings of coronavirus disease COVID19 have rarely been reported owing to its contagious nature Here, we treated an 82yearold man whose condition was diagnosed as COVID19 pneumonia, which exacerbated approximately 25u2009days after the initial onset The patient died despite receiving intensive care Postmortem percutaneous needle biopsy of the lungs and liver tissue was performed, including genomic analysis, immunochemical tests, and pathological studies Histopathology of the lungs showed both exudative and organizing diffuse alveolar damage Supposedly, the organizing phase of acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS induced COVID19 Polymerase chain reaction PCR test and immunostaining of biopsy specimens showed negative results for COVID19 Postmortem percutaneous needle biopsy was more effective in reducing the risk of contagiousness than autopsy,OBJECTIVE Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID19 caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2, is still spreading worldwide, which may progress to pulmonary fibrosis PF, leading to the worsen outcome As the markers of lung injury, the correlation of Krebs von den Lungen6 KL6 and fibronectin Fn with pulmonary fibrosis in COVID19 was still unclear METHODS 113 patients diagnosed as COVID19 were enrolled in this retrospective study, and divided into three categories as mild, moderate and severe cases The concentrations of serum KL6 and Fn at hospital admission were tested using the method of latex agglutination assay and immunoturbidimetic assay, respectively RESULTS Compared with that in the nonsevere COVID19 cases and normal control subjects, serum KL6 concentration on admission was significantly higher in the severe group, which was positively correlated with Creactive protein, and negatively correlated with lymphocytes count Whereas, no obvious elevation in serum Fn concentration was investigated in COVID19 patients with the different phenotypes The severe cases displayed the higher incident rate of pulmonary fibrosis at hospital discharge Compared with nonPF patients, the COVID19 cases with PF had the higher serum KL6 values CONCLUSION Serum KL6 concentration was significantly elevated in severe COVID19 patients, which may be useful for evaluating the disease severity For early prevention of the development of pulmonary fibrosis, high concentrations of serum KL6 in the early stage of COVID19 should be paid close attention,Background Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 may predispose patients to thrombotic events The best anticoagulation strategy for continuous renal replacement therapy CRRT in such patients is still under debate The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact that different anticoagulation protocols have on filter clotting riskMethods This was a retrospective observational study comparing two different anticoagulation strategies citrate only and citrate plus intravenous infusion of unfractionated heparin in patients with acute kidney injury AKI, associated or not with COVID19 COV AKI and COV AKI, respectively, submitted to CRRT Filter clotting risks in the first 72 hours were compared between groupsResults Between January 2019 and July 2020, 248 patients were evaluated 189 in the COV AKI group and 59 in the COV AKI group Filter clotting occurred during the first 72 hours of CRRT in 96 patients 387 Heparin use conferred protection against filter clotting, resulting in longer filter survival Bleeding events and the need for blood transfusion were similar between the citrate only and citrate plus unfractionated heparin strategies Inhospital mortality was higher among the COV AKI patients than among the COV AKI patients, although it was similar between the COV AKI patients who received heparin and those who did not Filter clotting was more common in patients with Ddimer levels above the median 6086 ngml In the multivariate analysis, the protective effect of heparin against filter clotting persisted, whereas an elevated Ddimer level, high platelet count, and high hemoglobin were found to be risk factors for circuit clotting A diagnosis of COVID19 was not a risk factor for filter clottingConclusions In COV AKI patients, adding systemic heparin to standard regional citrate anticoagulation may prolong CRRT filter patency by reducing clotting risk with low risk of complications,Risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 is increased in patients with certain comorbidities, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD By contrast, epidemiological data from many but not all countries indicate a low prevalence of asthma among patients with severe COVID19 This reduced risk of severe COVID19 may apply specifically to patients with the type 2 asthma endotype, which is most common in childhood asthma,,,Heart failure threatens the lives of patients and reduces their quality of life Heart failure, especially heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, is closely related to systemic and local cardiac persistent chronic lowgrade aseptic inflammation, microvascular damage characterized by endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, myocardial remodeling, and fibrosis However, the initiation and development of persistent chronic lowgrade aseptic inflammation is unexplored Oxidative stressmediated neutrophil extracellular traps NETs are the main immune defense mechanism against external bacterial infections Furthermore, NETs play important roles in noninfectious diseases After the onset of myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, or myocarditis, neutrophils infiltrate the damaged tissue and aggravate inflammation In tissue injury, damagerelated molecular patterns DAMPs may induce pattern recognition receptors PRRs to cause NETs, but whether NETs are directly involved in the pathogenesis and development of heart failure and the mechanism is still unclear In this review, we analyzed the markers of heart failure and heart failurerelated diseases and comorbidities, such as mitochondrial DNA, high mobility box group box 1, fibronectin extra domain A, and galectin3, to explore their role in inducing NETs and to investigate the mechanism of PRRs, such as Tolllike receptors, receptor for advanced glycation end products, cGASSTING, and CXC motif chemokine receptor 2, in activating NETosis Furthermore, we discussed oxidative stress, especially the possibility that imbalance of thiol redox and MPOderived HOCl promotes the production of 2chlorofatty acid and induces NETosis, and analyzed the possibility of NETs triggering coronary microvascular thrombosis In some heart diseases, the deletion or blocking of neutrophilspecific myeloperoxidase and peptidylarginine deiminase 4 has shown effectiveness According to the results of current pharmacological studies, MPO and PAD4 inhibitors are effective at least for myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, and certain autoimmune diseases, whose deterioration can lead to heart failure This is essential for understanding NETosis as a therapeutic factor of heart failure and the related new pathophysiology and therapeutics of heart failure,Venousarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation VAECMO treatment for acute cardiogenic shock in patients who also have acute lung injury predisposes development of a serious complication called northsouth syndrome NSS which causes cerebral hypoxia NSS is poorly characterized and hemodynamic studies have focused on cerebral perfusion ignoring the heart We hypothesized in NSS the heart would be more likely to receive hypoxemic blood than the brain due to the proximity of the coronary arteries to the aortic annulus To test this, we conducted a computational fluid dynamics simulation of blood flow in a human supported by VAECMO Simulations quantified the fraction of blood at each aortic branching vessel originating from residual native cardiac output versus VAECMO As residual cardiac function was increased, simulations demonstrated myocardial hypoxia would develop prior to cerebral hypoxia These results illustrate the conditions where NSS will develop and the relative cardiac function that will lead to organspecific hypoxiaGraphical AbstractIllustration of the impact of northsouth syndrome on organspecific oxygen delivery Patients on VAECMO have two sources of blood flow, one from the VAECMO circuit and one from the residual cardiac function When there is no residual cardiac function, all organs are perfused with oxygenated blood As myocardial recovery progresses, blood supply from the two sources will begin to mix resulting in nonhomogeneous mixing and differential oxygenation based upon the anatomical site of branching vessels,BACKGROUND Homebased cardiac telerehabilitation HBCT is a feasible and effective alternative to traditional centerbased cardiac rehabilitation CBCR Currently, there are only limited studies focusing on a longterm effect of HBCT, which means it is essential to do more research in this study field AIM This study aimed at investigating a 1year effect of a randomized controlled study using Cardiac Rehabilitation through the Global Position System CRGPS compared to outpatient cardiac rehabilitation Study focused on cardiorespiratory fitness CRF and healthrelated quality of life HRQL in patients with coronary heart disease CAD DESIGN A longterm followup of a randomized study SETTING Patients were enrolled, and the intervention was performed in an outpatient or homebased model The results were obtained and evaluated in a hospital POPULATION Patients who participated in the CRGPS study were diagnosed with CAD with low to moderate cardiovascular risk METHODS Patients enrolled in the study were eligible participants who had previously completed a 12week HBCT program using a wrist heart rate HR monitor or attended a traditional CBCR Primary outcome was the change in CRF expressed in peak oxygen uptake pVO2, and the secondary outcomes were selfreported HRQL, objectively measured anthropometric characteristics, and mortality and hospitalization rates RESULTS 44 patients 76 completed the longterm followup The average peak of pVO2 was higher after 1year followup in the telerehabilitation group HBCT 255 ml  kg  min compared to the active control group CBCR 236 ml  kg  min p  0047 No statistically significant difference between the two groups was found after longterm followup for the parameter HRQL For both groups, there was a significant improvement in the range of perceptions of general health There was no death case and no difference in hospitalization rate between the groups CONCLUSIONS This study supports the HBCT model It has been demonstrated that it induces satisfactory longterm effects in pVO2, exercise performance, and perceived general health in CAD patients with low to moderate cardiovascular risk CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT Cardiovascular telerehabilitation using wrist HR monitors is a feasible and effective rehabilitation method that can help patients eliminate barriers that prevent them from using CBCR programs Especially in the current global situation with the COVID19 pandemic, this topic is becoming increasingly important,Background Ellisvan Creveld syndrome EVC is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, the features of the syndrome are chondral and ectodermal dysplasia characterized by short ribs, polydactyly, growth retardation resulting in dwarfism, teeth and craniofacial abnormalities and heart defects mostly endocardial cushions and atrial septal defectsxa0Case presentation We describe the first case of COVID19 infection in a 24yearsold girl, diagnosed with EVC syndrome The patient suffered only from a mild illness, she remained stable with normal saturation without need of neither respiratory support nor specific therapy and she was rapidly dischargedConclusions This case appraises the pathophiosiologic interplay between different specific prognostic variable in a syndromic patient with congenital heart disease and COVID19,BACKGROUND Individuals with congenital heart defects CHDs are recommended to receive all inpatient cardiac and noncardiac care at facilities that can offer specialized care We describe geographic accessibility to such centers in New York State and determine several factors associated with receiving care there METHODS We used inpatient hospitalization data from the Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System SPARCS in New York State 20082013 In the absence of specific adult CHD care center designations during our study period, we identified pediatricadult and adultonly cardiac surgery centers through the Cardiac Surgery Reporting System to estimate agebased specialized care We calculated oneway drive and public transit time in minutes from residential address to centers using R gmapsdistance package and the Google Maps Distance Application Programming Interface API We calculated prevalence ratios using modified Poisson regression with modelbased standard errors, fit with generalized estimating equations clustered at the hospital level and subclustered at the individual level RESULTS Individuals with CHDs were more likely to seek care at pediatricadult or adultonly cardiac surgery centers if they had severe CHDs, private health insurance, higher severity of illness at encounter, a surgical procedure, cardiac encounter, and shorter drive time These findings can be used to increase care receipt especially for noncardiac care at pediatricadult or adultonly cardiac surgery centers, identify areas with limited access, and reduce disparities in access to specialized care among this highrisk population,Abstract  Background Accurate methods of identifying patients with COVID19 who are at high risk of poor outcomes has become especially important with the advent of limitedavailability therapies such as monoclonal antibodies Here we describe development and validation of a simple but accurate scoring tool to classify risk of hospitalization and mortality   Methods All consecutive patients testing positive for SARSCoV2 from March 25October 1, 2020 within the Intermountain Healthcare system were included The cohort was randomly divided into 70 derivation and 30 validation cohorts A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted for 14day hospitalization The optimal model was then adapted to a simple, probabilistic score and applied to the validation cohort and evaluated for prediction of hospitalization and 28day mortality   Results 22,816 patients were included mean age was 40 years, 501 were female and 44 identified as nonwhite race or HispanicLatinx ethnicity 62 required hospitalization and 04 died Criteria in the simple model included age 05 points per decade highrisk comorbidities 2 points each diabetes mellitus, severe immunocompromised status and obesity body mass index30 nonwhite raceHispanic or Latinx ethnicity 2 points, and 1 point each for male sex, dyspnea, hypertension, coronary artery disease, cardiac arrythmia, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic liver disease, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic neurologic disease In the derivation cohort n16,030 area under the receiveroperator characteristic curve AUROC was 082 95 CI 081084 for hospitalization and 091 083094 for 28day mortality in the validation cohort n6,786 AUROC for hospitalization was 08 CI 078082 and for mortality 08 CI 06909   Conclusion A prediction score based on widely available patient attributes accurately risk stratifies patients with COVID19 at the time of testing Applications include patient selection for therapies targeted at preventing disease progression in nonhospitalized patients, including monoclonal antibodies External validation in independent healthcare environments is needed,Background The long QT syndrome is characterized by prolongation of QT interval, which may lead to lifethreatening cardiac arrhythmias Objectives were to assess prevalence, quantity and severity of QTc prolongation with combined drugs azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine in adults COVID19 patients treated on these agents at KFSHRC And to characterize cardiac complications of QTc prolongation with combined drugs Methods A retrospective cohort study at KFSHRC, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Baseline and daily ECG was done until completion of duration as per KFSHRC guidelines for management of Covid19, QTc prolongation500 or increase of at least 60 ms compared with the predrug baseline value, or presence of cardiac conductive complications torsades de pointes The QTc prolongation was defined as470 for male and 480 for female as per American Heart Association A risk score that has been validated by Tisdale et al, for prediction of QT prolongation drugrelated in admitted patients in cardiac care unit The study duration was specified as one month after study approval by Research Ethics committee Results A total of 74 patients were included in the study The patients were distributed according to their risk score for prediction of QT prolongation as the following low 6774, medium 674, high 174 Two patients with medium risk were started on both azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine one of them his baseline QT was 490, Azithromycin was stopped as QT reached 502 The second patient has QT baseline 471, after starting treatment QT range was 472475, hydroxychloroquine was stopped on day 4 None of them had torsades de pointes Only one patient with low risk, no baseline QT was recorded, but QT was 499 on day three, so hydroxychloroquine was stopped Repeated ECG showed QT decreased to 478, no torsades de pointes xa0 Conclusions In this single centeredretrospective cohort, we noticed that a small percentage of patients developed QT prolongation with the use of this combination With the increasing the risk of developing QT prolongation the number of the patient who developed the condition increased We used Tisdale score which is a scoring system Identifying hospitalized patients at risk for QT interval prolongation could lead to interventions to reduce the risk of torsades de pointes validated in May 20135 None of our population developed significant cardiac complications of QTc prolongation with combined drugs,Background During COVID19 pandemic, elective invasive cardiac procedures ICP have been frequently cancelled or postponed Consequences may be more evident in patients with diabetesxa0Objectives The objective was to identify the peculiarities of patients with DM among those in whom ICP were cancelled or postponed due to the COVID19 pandemic, as well as to identify subgroups in which the influence of DM has higher impact on the clinical outcomeMethods We included 2,158 patients in whom an elective ICP was cancelled or postponed during COVID19 pandemic in 37 hospitals in Spain Among them, 700 324 were diabetics Patients with and without diabetes were comparedResults Patients with diabetes were older and had a higher prevalence of other cardiovascular risk factors, previous cardiovascular history and comorbidities Diabetics had a higher mortality 30 vs 10 p0001 and cardiovascular mortality 19 vs 04 p0001 Differences were especially important in patients with valvular heart disease mortality 69 vs 17 p0001 and cardiovascular mortality 49 vs 09 p0002 in patients with and without diabetes, respectively In the multivariable analysis, diabetes remained as an independent risk factor both for overall and cardiovascular mortality No significant interaction was found with other clinical variablesConclusion Among patients in whom an elective invasive cardiac procedure is cancelled or postponed during COVID19 pandemic, mortality and cardiovascular mortality is higher in patients with diabetes, irrespectively on other clinical conditions These procedures should not be cancelled in patients with diabetes,,Aims COVID19 patients with comorbidities such as hypertension or heart failure HF are associated with poor clinical outcomes The cellular distribution of Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2, the critical enzyme for SARSCoV2 infection, in the human heart is unknown We explore the underlying mechanism that leads to increased susceptibility to SARSCoV2 in patients with cardiovascular diseases and patients of cardiac dysfunction have increased risk of multiorgan injury compared with patients of normal cardiac function Methods and Results We analyzed singlecell RNA sequencing scRNAseq data in both normal and failing hearts The results demonstrated that ACE2 is present in cardiomyocytes CMs and nonCMs, while the number of ACE2postive ACE2 CMs and ACE2 gene expression in these CMs are significantly increased in the failing hearts Interestingly, both brain natriuretic peptides BNP and atrial natriuretic peptide ANP are significantly upregulated in the ACE2 CMs, which is consistent with other studies that ACE2, ANP, and BNP increased in HF patients We found that genes related to virus entry, virus replication and suppression of interferongamma signaling are all upregulated in failing CMs, and the increase was significantly higher in ACE2 CMs, suggesting that these CMs may be more vulnerable to virus infection As the level of expression of both ACE2 and BNP in CMs were upregulated, we further performed retrospective analysis of the plasma BNP levels and clinical outcomes of 91 COVID19 patients from a singlecenter Patients with higher plasma BNP were associated with significantly higher mortality and expression levels of inflammatory and infective markers Conclusion In the failing heart, the upregulation of ACE2 and virus infection associated genes could potentially facilitate SARSCoV2 virus entry and replication in these vulnerable cardiomyocyte subsets COVID19 patients with higher plasma BNP levels had poorer clinical outcomes These observations may allude to a potential regulatory association between ACE2 and BNP in mediating myocarditis associated with COVID19,BACKGROUND Prior studies have estimated healthcare costs for cystic fibrosis CF of 8000131,000, but do not account for impacts of CF modulator therapy This study aims to assess utilization patterns and cost of CF care in a center in the United States METHODS Care utilization patterns and costs at a large pediatricadult CF center were examined from November 2017 to November 2018 Subjects were stratified by age and cost excluding pharmacy costs were calculated based on hospitalderived utilization charges RESULTS A total of 166 patients were reviewed with mean clinical charges of 28,755 Lower lung function 23,032 normal lung function, 62,293 moderate reduction, 186,786 severe reduction pu2009u200905, hospitalizations 85,452 yes, 6362 no pu2009u20090001, Pseudomonas positive culture 48,660 positive, 22,013 negative, pu2009u20090001, and CFrelated diabetes 161,892 CFRD, 22,153 no CFRD pu2009u2009001 were associated with increased charges Patients utilizing Ivacaftor had lower charges compared to lumacaftorivacaftor 6633 vs 33,039 pu2009u200905 and tezacaftorivacaftor 6633 vs 64,434 pu2009u2009002 CONCLUSION Our study characterized utilization and care charges among a CF cohort Lower lung function, hospitalizations, and CFRD were associated with increased charges,BackgroundThe third most frequent chronic condition, and the fourth most common cause of death, in Poland is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD The diagnosis and treatment of COPD is the responsibility of the general practitioner GP the GP also serves as gatekeeper, referring patients to the other levels of public health care system when necessary Undertreatment of COPD can result in a greater frequency of exacerbations and hospitalizations Elderly patients require special attention due to the increased prevalence of COPD and systemic comorbidities However, both the occurrence of exacerbations and the quality of life of the patients may be improved by developing and implementing guidelines for practice and ensuring their adherence This proposal concerns the development of a checklistbased educational program to assist general practitioners in managing COPD patientsMethodsNo less than eightyfour general clinics in the Lodz region, Poland 28 clusters in each of three study arms, will be identified, randomized, and included in the trial The trial will be based on anonymized data in electronic health records within the national public health care systemThe educational intervention program will consist of GPs in two intervention arms being provided with a COPD management checklist those in the first intervention arm with receive the checklist once at the beginning, while those in the second with receive it twice The third control arm receives standard care without the checklistThe study used the International Code of Diseases ICD10 for COPD The primary aim is to determine the effect of interventions delivered to general practitioners GPs in primary health care These interventions are aimed at decreasing the hospitalization of elderly patients with medical code J44 COPD as the main reason for hospital admissionDiscussionThe results of this trial will be directly applicable to primary care in Poland and add new data to the growing body of evidence regarding interventions aimed at improving chronic illness careTrial registrationThis trial has been registered with the Clinical Trials Protocol Registration System Please see in ClinicalTrialgov identifier NCT Number NCT04301505 Registered on 10 March 2020,The metabolic regulator fibroblast growth factor 21 FGF21 has been reported as a cardioprotective factor regulating cardiac remodeling in several cardiac diseases In a recent issue of The Journal of Pathology, FerrerCurriu et al investigated FGF21 in alcoholic cardiomyopathy ACM They showed that FGF21 deficiency aggravates alcoholinduced cardiac damage and dysfunction by exacerbating mitochondrial alterations, oxidative stress, and lipid metabolic dysregulation, suggesting FGF21 as a promising therapeutic agent in ACM Paradoxically, FGF21 cardiac and circulating levels correlate with cardiac damage and oxidative stress in patients with ACM, pointing to FGF21 as a potential biomarker of alcoholinduced cardiac damage Further studies are needed to address when FGF21 can be used as a diagnostic biomarker and when it can be used as a therapeutic agent to treat ACM

1212C2 fully human monoclonal antibody was derived from an IgM memory B cell of a COVID19 patient, has high affinity for the Spike protein Receptor Binding Domain, neutralizes SARSCoV2 and exhibits in vivo prophylactic and therapeutic activity in hamsters when delivered intraperitoneally, reducing upper and lower respiratory viral burden and lung pathology Inhalation of nebulized 1212C2 at levels as low as 06mgkg, corresponding to 003mgkg of lung deposited dose, reduced viral burden below the detection limit, and mitigated lung pathology The therapeutic efficacy of an exceedingly lowdose of inhaled 1212C2 supports the rationale for local lung delivery for dosesparing benefits as compared to the conventional parenteral route of administration These results suggest clinical development of 1212C2 formulated and delivered via inhalation for the treatment of SARSCoV2 infection should be considered,PURPOSE To evaluate the prognostic role of chest computed tomography CT, alone or in combination with clinical and laboratory parameters, in COVID19 patients during the first peak of the pandemic METHODS A retrospective singlecenter study of 301 COVID19 patients referred to our Emergency Department ED from February 25 to March 29, 2020 At presentation, patients underwent chest CT and clinical and laboratory examinations Outcomes included discharge from the ED after improvementrecovery positive outcome, or admission to the intensive care unit or death poor prognosis A visual quantitative analysis was formed using two scores the Pulmonary Involvement PI score based on the extension of lung involvement, and the Pulmonary Consolidation PC score based on lung consolidation The prognostic value of CT alone or integrated with other parameters was studied by logistic regression and ROC analysis RESULTS The impact of the CT PI score 15 vsu2009u20096 on predicting poor prognosis OR 571 95  CI 1931692, Pu2009u20090002 was demonstrated no significant association was found for the PC score Chest CT had a prognostic role considering the PI score alone AUC 0722 and when evaluated with demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and laboratory data AUC 0841 We, therefore, developed a nomogram as an easy tool for immediate clinical application CONCLUSIONS Visual analysis of CT gives useful information to physicians for prognostic evaluations, even in conditions of COVID19 emergency The predictive value is increased by evaluating CT in combination with clinical and laboratory data,Background Myocardial injury is a common manifestation in patients with coronavirus disease COVID19, and the correlation with adverse outcomes has been demonstrated therefore, adequate monitoring of myocardial injury markers is very important   Case Summary A patient with COVID19 was hospitalized in our hospital with an initial classification of intermediate risk for myocardial injury, after serial measurements of myocardial injury markers, risk was readjusted to high, as shown later by electrocardiographic abnormalities The patient underwent emergency diagnostic coronary angiography and successful angioplasty The patient was discharged to home   Discussion Myocardial injury riskstratification is essential in patients with COVID19, since it is essential in the recognition of patients who are susceptible to cardiovascular complications,The incidence of thrombotic complications is extremely high among severe coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 patients in the intensive care unit Various factors such as a cytokine storm due to an excessive immune response to inflammation, hypoxemia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation are considered predisposing factors for thrombotic complications A 55yearold Japanese man intubated eight days previously was referred to our hospital because of a severe COVID19 pneumonia diagnosis after his pharyngeal swab tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 using reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction The patient continued to remain hypoxic PaO2FiO2 ratio 100 mmHg at the referring hospital On admission, we initiated venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation VVECMO Unfractionated heparin and nafamostat mesylate were used as anticoagulants during VVECMO Despite adequate anticoagulant therapy, he developed pulmonary infarction due to pulmonary embolism followed by hemoptysis On day 10 following admission, his oxygen saturation dropped from 95 to 88, with a marked decrease in his ventilator tidal volume, accompanied by an inability to ventilate the patient Thereafter, we increased the VVECMO flow and exchanged his endotracheal tube The lumen of the removed tracheal tube was found to be occluded by a largesized blood coagulum There was no further episode of tube occlusion The patient was discharged in a walkable state on day 39 following admission Endotracheal tube obstruction secondary to hemoptysis should be suggested in patients with COVID19 requiring ventilator support, as they are unable to perform frequent endotracheal tube suctions owing to the risk of infection,BACKGROUND A variety of digital intervention approaches have been investigated for asthma therapy during the last decade, with different levels of interactivity and personalization, with a range of impacts on different outcome measurements OBJECTIVE To assess the effectiveness of digital interventions in asthma with regards to acceptability and outcomes and evaluate the potential of digital initiatives for monitoring or treating patients with asthma METHODS We evaluated digital interventions using a scoping review methodology via literature search and review Of 871 articles identified, 121 were evaluated to explore intervention characteristics, the perception and acceptability of digital interventions to patients and physicians, and effects on asthma outcomes Interventions were categorized by their level of interactivity with the patient RESULTS Interventions featuring nonindividualized content sent to patients appeared capable of promoting improved adherence to inhaled corticosteroids, but with no identified improvement in asthma burden, and datagathering interventions appeared to have little effect on adherence or asthma burden Evidence of improvement in both adherence and patients impairment due to asthma were seen only with interactive interventions involving twoway responsive patient communication Digital interventions were generally positively perceived by patients and physicians Implementation was considered feasible, with certain preferences for design and features important to drive usage CONCLUSIONS Digital health interventions show substantial promise for asthma disease monitoring and personalization of treatment To be successful, future interventions will need to include both inhaler device and software elements, combining accurate measurement of clinical parameters with careful consideration of ease of use, personalization and patient engagement aspects,Prior to the antibiotics era, the mortality rate from cavernous sinus thrombosis CST was very high reaching 100 There have been very few reports of CST associated with tooth extraction on the same time Coronavirus disease of 2019 COVID19 is known to increase the risk of developing venous thromboembolism therefore, patients with COVID19 may present with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis We present a case with diagnostic dilemma and first to be reported in the literature,Covid sickness 2019 COVID‐19 flareup is a continuous pandemic brought about by serious intense respiratory condition Covid 2 SARS‐CoV‐2 with impressive mortality around the world The fundamental clinical indication of COVID‐19 is the presence of respiratory side effects however a few patients create extreme cardiovascular and renal inconveniences There is desperation to comprehend the instrument by which this infection causes difficulties to create treatment choices Curcumin, a characteristic polyphenolic compound, could be a potential treatment choice for patients with Covid infection In this examination, we audit a portion of the likely impacts of curcumin, for example, repressing the section of infection to the phone, restraining epitome of the infection and viral protease, just as tweaking different cell flagging pathways This survey gives a premise to additional innovative work of clinical utilizations of curcumin for the treatment of recently arose SARS‐CoV‐2,CXRNet is a twomodule Artificial Intelligence pipeline for the quick detection of SARSCoV2 from chest Xrays CXRs Module 1 was trained on a public dataset of 6395 CXRs with radiologist annotated lung contours to generate masks of the lungs that overlap the heart and large vasa Module 2 is a hybrid convnet in which the first convolutional layer with learned coefficients is replaced by a layer with fixed coefficients provided by the Wavelet Scattering Transform WST Module 2 takes as inputs the patients CXRs and corresponding lung masks calculated by Module 1, and produces as outputs a class assignment Covid vs nonCovid and high resolution heat maps that identify the SARS associated lung regions Module 2 was trained on a dataset of CXRs from nonCovid and RTPCR confirmed Covid patients acquired at the Henry Ford Health System HFHS Hospital in Detroit All nonCovid CXRs were from preCovid era 20182019, and included images from both normal lungs and lungs affected by nonCovid pathologies Training and test sets consisted of 2265 CXRs 1417 Covid negative, 848 Covid positive, and 1532 CXRs 945 Covid negative, 587 Covid positive, respectively Six distinct crossvalidation models, each trained on 1887 images and validated against 378 images, were combined into an ensemble model that was used to classify the CXR images of the test set with resulting Accuracy  0789, Precision  0739, Recall  0693, F1 score  0715, ROCAUC  0852,, The coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 may cause not only an acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS but also multiple organ damage and failure requiring intensive care and leading to death Male sex, advanced age, chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity have been identified as risk factors for the COVID19 severity Presumably, as these three cardiovascular risk factors are associated with a high prevalence of multiorgan damage In the present focused clinical review, we will discuss the cardiovascular complications of COVID19 including acute cardiovascular syndrome acute cardiac injuryCOVID cardiomyopathy, thromboembolic complications and arrhythmias and postCOVID19 sequelae Preliminary data shows that the cause of acute cardiovascular syndrome may be multifactorial and involve direct viral invasion of the heart and vascular system, as well as through the immune and inflammationmediated systemic cytokine storm COVID19 survivors may also show persistently elevated blood pressure and sinus tachycardia at rest Furthermore, poor diabetic control, persistent renal damage and cerebral sequelae, such as persistent cognitive and neuropsychiatric alterations are also frequently reported A particular attention should be paid towards cardiovascular protection in COVID19 patients who develop acute cardiovascular syndromes during hospitalization, andor permanentsemipermanent sequelae after recovery from COVID19 These conditions may require careful clinical assessment, treatment and close followup to avoid shortterm and longterm complications,,,,,,BACKGROUND The impact of asthma diagnosis and asthma endotype on outcomes from COVID19 infection remains unclear OBJECTIVE To describe the association between asthma diagnosis and endotype and clinical outcomes among patients diagnosed with COVID19 infection METHODS Retrospective multicenter cohort study of outpatients and inpatients presenting to six hospitals in the Mount Sinai Health System New York metropolitan region between March 7 th to June 7 th , 2020, with COVID19 infection, with and without a history of asthma The primary outcome assessed was inhospital mortality Secondary outcomes included hospitalization, intensive care unit ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and hospital length of stay Outcomes were compared in patients with or without asthma using a multivariate Cox regression model Outcomes stratified by blood eosinophilia count were also assessed RESULTS Of 10,523 patients diagnosed with COVID19 infection, 4902 patients were hospitalized, and 468 had a diagnosis of asthma 44 When adjusted for COVID19 disease severity, comorbidities, and concurrent therapies, patients with asthma had a lower mortality adjusted odds ratio OR 064 053077, p0001 and a lower rate of hospitalization and ICU admission OR 043 028064 p0001 and OR 051 041064, p0001 respectively Those with blood eosinophils 200 cellsμL, both with and without asthma, had lower mortality CONCLUSION Patients with asthma may be at a reduced risk of poor outcomes from COVID19 infection Eosinophilia, both in those with and without asthma, may be associated with reduced mortality risk,BACKGROUND The novel coronavirus disease2019 COVID19 caused a sudden and unexpected increase in the number of hospital admissions and deaths worldwide The impact of social distancing on blood stocks was significant Data on the use of blood products by patients with COVID19 are scarce MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective observational study was conducted by analysing the medical records of 3014 hospitalized COVID19 patients in 16 Brazilian hospitals Individual data related to clinical, laboratory and transfusion characteristics and outcomes of these patients were collected Patients characteristics association with mortality and transfusion need were tested independently by logistic regression models RESULTS Patients mean age was 57·6xa0years In 2298 76·2 patients, there was an underlying clinical comorbidity A total of 1657 55 patients required admission to intensive care unit ICU, and 943 31 patients required ventilatory support and orotracheal intubation OTI There was a total of 471 15·6 deaths among all patients 325 patients 10·7 required blood transfusion 3187 blood products were transfused 1364 red blood cells in 303 patients, 1092 platelet units in 78 patients, 303 fresh frozen plasma in 49 patients and 423 cryoprecipitates in 21 patients The mortality among patients who received transfusion was substantially higher than that among the total study population CONCLUSION Need for transfusion was low in COVID19 patients, but significantly higher in patients admitted to ICU and in those who needed OTI Knowledge of the transfusion profile of these patients allows better strategies for maintaining the blood stocks of hospitals during the pandemic,Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ARDS is a heterogeneous lung disease responsible for significant morbidity and mortality among critically ill patients, including those infected with SARSCoV2, the virus responsible for COVID19 Despite recent advances in pathophysiology, diagnostics, and therapeutics, ARDS is dangerously underdiagnosed and supportive lung protective ventilation and prone position remain the mainstay intervention Rescue therapies including neuromuscular blockade and venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation VVECMO remain a key component of clinical practice though benefits are uncertain While COVID19 ARDS has some distinguishing features from traditional ARDS, including delayed onset, hyperinflammatory response, and pulmonary microthrombi, it is clinically similar to traditional ARDS and should be treated with established supportive therapies,The new lung allocation policy has led to an increase in distant donors and consequently enhanced logistical burden of procuring organs Though early singlecenter studies noted similar outcomes between sameteam transplantation ST, procuring team from transplanting center and differentteam transplantation DT, procuring team from different center, the efficacy of DT in the contemporary era remains unclear In this study, we evaluated the trend of DT, rate of transplanting both donor lungs, 1year graft survival, and risk of Grade 3 primary graft dysfunction PGD using the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipient SRTR database from 2006 to 2018 A total of 21619 patients DT 2085, 97 with 19837 donors were included Utilization of DT decreased from 159 in 2006 to 85 in 2018 Proportions of twolung donors were similar between the groups, and DT had similar 1year graft survival as ST for both double DT, HR 1108, 95 CI 08941374 and single lung transplants DT, HR 1094, 95 CI 09311286 Risk of Grade 3 PGD was also similar between ST and DT Given our results, expanding DT may be a feasible option for improving lung procurement efficiency in the current era, particularly in light of the COVID19 pandemic,The COVID19 pandemic has created an unprecedented global health care crisis COVID19 patients are found to have increased thrombotic risk Despite being on prophylactic anticoagulation, many develop serious arterial and venous thromboembolic events Emerging reports indicate COVID19 may be considered a novel risk factor for portal vein thrombosis Although, intraabdominal infections are identified as risk factors, clostridium difficile colitis has not been typically seen as a risk factor for PVT We report a case of an elderly female with a recent diagnosis of COVID19 and no prior history of cirrhosis or malignancy who presented with diarrhea due to clostridium difficile infection She developed sudden onset severe abdominal pain during the course of hospitalization Acute portal vein thrombosis was identified on CT imaging of the abdomen, and she improved well with therapeutic anticoagulation Acute portal vein thrombosis usually results from a combination of local and systemic prothrombotic risk factors The combination of local infection by clostridium difficile and COVID19 coagulopathy led to development of portal vein thrombosis in our patient To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of portal vein thrombosis reported in a patient with clostridium difficile infection in the setting of COVID19 coagulopathy During the current pandemic, clinicians should strongly consider abdominal imaging in patients presenting with abdominal pain due to clostridium difficile infection in the setting of COVID19 to rule out complications such as portal vein thrombosis Early diagnosis and treatment of portal vein thrombosis prevent complications of portal hypertension and intestinal infarctions,COVID19 disease is associated with a high inflammatory load that can induce vascular inflammation, myocarditis, and cardiac arrhythmias Mortality from COVID19 disease in 2019 is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension These disorders share the underlying pathophysiology related to the reninangiotensin system SARS Cardiovascular disease and SARS pharmacological inhibition increase ACE2 levels, which can increase coronavirus virulence in the lung and heart On the other hand, there is evidence that coronavirus infection can decrease ACE2, leading to toxic overaccumulation of angiotensin II, which induces acute respiratory distress syndrome and fulminant myocarditis In addition, there is scientific evidence that SARSCoV2 can bind chemically to the heme group of hemoglobin and thus cause the release of iron ions Fe2 and Fe3 that can damage tissues, including the lungs and heart Another important information is that the heme group is produced by mitochondria and, in this case, the oral or intramuscular use of Coenzyme Q10 ubiquinone is strongly recommended, as it stimulates the increase in mitochondrial production Therefore, the use of chelators of iron ions is notorious, as well as the administration of Coenzyme Q10 as a treatment for patients infected with SARSCoV2,Several preclinical and clinical trials show that exogenous pulmonary surfactant has clinical efficacy in inflammatory lung diseases, especially ARDS By infecting type II alveolar cells, COVID19 interferes with the production and secretion of the pulmonary surfactant and therefore causes an increase in surface tension, which in turn can lead to alveolar collapse The use of the pulmonary surfactant seems to be promising as an additional therapy for the treatment of ARDS COVID19 causes lung damage and ARDS, so beneficial effects of surfactant therapy in COVID19associated ARDS patients are conceivable, especially when applied early in the treatment strategy against pulmonary failure Because of the robust antiinflammatory and lung protective efficacy and the current urgent need for lungsupportive therapy, the exogenous pulmonary surfactant could be a valid supportive treatment of COVID19 pneumonia patients in intensive care units in addition to the current standard of ARDS treatment,,Abstract  Background The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 exposes vulnerable patients to high risk of mortality Patients with left ventricular assist device LVAD usually have symptoms such as cough, fever, and shortness of breath because of their cardiac condition and comorbidity, therefore these related symptoms challenge the correct diagnosis in time within the COVID19 pandemic   Case summary We report two case studies of patients with LVAD in whom COVID19 related symptoms were overlapped by their cardiac status and comorbidities In the first case, the patient was admitted for suspicion of COVID19 due to cough and shortness of breath for 1 month The blood test evocated a high index of suspicion of COVID19 The nasopharyngeal test for COVID19 performed on admission and at Day 2 was inconclusive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2, but the test obtained on Day 3 of admission was positive, whereas computed tomography confirmed the diagnosis of COVID19 This patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS and nasal epistaxis within 48 h during hospitalization The ARDS was treated by noninvasive ventilation and probabilistic antibiotics for 3 days and resulted significant improvement The nasal epistaxis due to international normalized ratio increase was treated by nasal packing and vitamin K antagonist was switched to parenteral heparin infusion The patient was kept hospitalized for 1 month for further supportive treatment In the second case, the patient was admitted for recurrent anaemia due to melaena, the patient was tested for COVID19 because of newonset symptoms of cough and rhinorrhoea The first nasopharyngeal test was positive, and sudden increase of anticoagulation status was noted in the setting of gastrointestinal bleeding The anticoagulation status was controlled by parenteral heparin infusion, and the melaena was disappeared at Day 3 The moderate dyspnoea of the patient was quickly improved with nasal oxygen delivery for 4 days The patient was discharged at Day 5   Discussion COVID19 specific symptoms are challenging to distinguish in patients with LVADs, although radiological evidence can be beneficial in the COVID19 diagnosis We also observed the need for precise anticoagulation control to avoid bleeding or thrombotic events in these patients,The global number of COVID‐19 infections, as of December 23, 2020, stood at approximately 79 million, with over 17 million deaths The development of vascular inflammation may also contribute to a hypercoagulable state and endothelial dysfunction in such patients It is known that multi‐organ damage is more likely in patients with sepsis if they develop coagulopathy and that inhibition of thrombin synthesis can have a positive impact in reducing mortality In this review, we will focus on the protection of the most fragile groups of the population, such as the elderly This segment of the population will be a key issue and probably of primary interest to all Biomarkers appear to be extremely useful as an indicator of what is happening from a pathophysiological point of view in the heart, allowing us to better stratify the prognosis of our patients affected by COVID‐19, especially in the most severe cases and those with comorbidities Initially, COVID‐19 disease was identified as a disease involving the respiratory tract, with the possibility of progressing to severe interstitial pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Ever increasing data highlight the possibility that in addition to the lungs, the heart is also a possible target of the coronavirus and cardiovascular diseases seem to represent a multiplier of the risk of death in case of infection with Covid‐19,Abstract  Background Left ventricular LV aneurysms complicate anterior myocardial infarctions MIs in 815 of cases In case of associated LV dysfunction, rapidly evolving heart failure may follow, and urgent surgery becomes lifesaving   Case summary Following an acute anterior MI treated by percutaneous coronary intervention, which resulted in apical hypokinesis, depressed LV function, and moderate mitral regurgitation, a 70yearold male patient kept in contact with our cardiology department through phone calls Over 6 weeks, the patients conditions worsened For fear of contracting COVID19, he refused to attend to the Emergency Room Conditions did not improve despite medical therapy adjustments, and he was admitted to hospital following a syncope Computed tomography scan revealed pneumonia, and he was placed in a grey ward while waiting for noseswab results for COVID19 A rapid escalation of treatment was necessary as conditions did not improve with lowdose inotropes, and he required invasive ventilation An Impella 50 was implanted as support prior to surgery, was maintained during the procedure and as a means of weaning off extracorporeal circulation Surgery was successful and Impella 50 was removed on postoperative Day 5   Discussion To date, Impella use in cardiothoracic surgery has been described in case of ventricular septal rupture or as a bridge to permanent LV assist device In our case, Impella 50 was implanted, used as a bridge to surgery, and as postoperative support in a patient with evolving cardiogenic shock due to LV aneurysm and depressed LV ejection fraction following acute MI, in the difficult setting of the COVID19 pandemic,Background Lateonset complications of left atrial appendage occlusion LAAO device procedure are anecdotal and there are no such complications reported in literature using Cardia Ultraseal Cardia, Inc, Eagan, MN, USA Case summary We report the case of a 74yearold Caucasian man affected by paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with significant bleeding risk familiar thrombocytopenia, macroscopic haematuria episodes during therapy with direct oral anticoagulants, HASBLED risk score 4 and ischaemic risk as well CHADSVASC score 3 The patient was treated with LAAO device implantation for high bleeding risk Subsequently, after 26u2009days from LAAO procedure, he was admitted to the emergency department for haematic cardiac tamponade The patient was successfully treated with subxyphoidal pericardiocentesis in the acute phase, unfortunately cardiac arrest occurred during the transfer to the referral hospital for urgent cardiac surgery Permanent neurological damage was reported and the patient died on day 28 Discussion LAAO lateonset complications are very rare and the case presented is the first case described of lateonset pericardial effusion and tamponade secondary to the Cardia Ultraseal LAAO device implantation We present a revision of the literature regarding the occurrence of similar adverse events and discuss the hypothetical mechanism of this major complication,Pneumonia remains the leading cause of death globally in children under the age of five The poorest children are the ones most at risk of dying In the recent years, Lung Ultrasound has been widely documented as a safe and easy tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of pneumonia and several other respiratory infections and diseases During the pandemic, it played a primary role to achieve early suspicion and prediction of severe COVID19, reducing the risk of exposure of healthcare workers to positive patients However, innovations that can improve diagnosis and treatment allocation, saving hundreds of thousands of lives each year, are not reaching those who need them most In this paper, we discuss advantages and limits of different tools for the diagnosis of pneumonia in lowtomiddle income countries, highlighting potential benefits of a wider access to lung ultrasound in these settings and barriers to its implementation, calling international organizations to ensure the indiscriminate access, quality and sustainability of the provision of ultrasound services in every setting,At the end of 2019 a novel coronavirus was identified in Wuhan, China The disease caused by the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 was designated COVID19 corona virus disease 2019 by the World Health Organization in early 2020 Up to 80 of patients with COVID19 experience mild symptoms with severe or critical disease occurring in the remaining 20 Severe disease is manifested by the development of pneumonia, hypoxia and radiographic lung involvement while critical disease indicates multiorgan involvement with significant respiratory or cardiac compromise The current estimated case fatality rate from COVID19 is approximately 1 Epidemiological studies have shown that advanced age, male gender, previous chronic lung disease, cardiovascular and kidney disease, obesity and diabetes are risk factors for the severity of disease course In the current focused review, we present an overview of the acute cardiovascular complications of COVID19, their detection and impact upon prognosis doi

chest trauma in atrisk sports or activities in patients with a history of myocarditis has never been demonstrated or studied We report herein two cases of lifethreatening ventricular arrhythmia secondary to nonpenetrating blunt chest trauma while playing contact sports   Case summary The first patient, a 26yearold man described a brief loss of consciousness after having received blunt impact to the chest typical intensity while playing a rugby match The loss of consciousness was total and proceeded by rapid and regular palpitations He had a history of viral myocarditis 10 years prior with a fibrotic sequalae in the inferolateral wall on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging left ventricular ejection fraction 71 Right apical ventricular pacing induced a sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia reproducing the patients symptoms A subcutaneous implantable cardioverterdefibrillator was implanted The second patient is a 22yearold professional rugby player with no known notable history During a match, a direct blow to the chest wall was followed by a cardiac arrest A ventricular fibrillation was cardioverted to pulseless electrical activity Patient died despite cardiopulmonary resuscitation An autopsy identified a myocardial sequela of fibrosis with no acute inflammatory remodelling compatible with a previous myocarditis   Discussion Myocarditis may increase the risk of lifethreatening ventricular arrhythmias caused by blunt impact to the chest, particularly in contact sports Screening and prevention measures should be considered to reduce this risk,Abstract  Background  Takotsubo syndrome TS is defined as transient left ventricular dysfunction, which is often related to an emotional or physically stressful event We describe a case of TS in a lady with pyruvate carboxylase deficiency PCD Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency is rare condition with the majority of those affected demonstrating signs of failure to thrive, recurrent seizures, and metabolic acidosis To our knowledge, this is the first documented case of TS in an individual with PCD   Case summary  This 28yearold female presented to the emergency department after a tonicclonic seizure For 4 days prior to the presentation, she had been suffering from cough and pyrexia On Day 2, she developed abdominal pain associated with tachycardia and hypotension, and an elevated troponin 791 ngL The echocardiogram showed a severely impaired left ventricular systolic function, regional wall motion abnormalities RWMAs, and a visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 2530 Eight days following admission her clinical state significantly improved, with a reduction troponin to 60 ngL A repeat echocardiogram on Day 9 showed complete resolution of cardiac function with no RWMAs Following this, she was discharged from hospital the next day with a diagnosis of TS   Discussion  This is the first case report of TS in a patient with PCD In this case, multiple aetiologies of TS such as emotional and physical stress, seizures, and acute infection were considered This case also highlights that TS should be an important differential diagnosis in patients presenting with cardiac symptoms,BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 may be associated with cardiac arrhythmias in hospitalised patients, but data from the ICU setting are limited We aimed to describe the epidemiology of cardiac arrhythmias in ICU patients with COVID19 METHODS We conducted a multicenter, retrospective cohort study including all ICU patients with an airway sample positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 from March 1st to June 1st in the Capital Region of Denmark 18 million inhabitants We registered cardiac arrhythmias in ICU, potential risk factors, interventions used in ICU and outcomes RESULTS From the 7 ICUs we included 155 patients with COVID19 The incidence of cardiac arrhythmias in the ICU was 57155 37, 95 confidence interval 3045, and 3957 68 of these patients had this as newonset arrhythmia Previous history of tachyarrhythmias and higher disease severity at ICU admission were associated with cardiac arrhythmias in the adjusted analysis Fiftyfour of the 57 95 patients had supraventricular origin of the arrhythmia, 3957 68 received at least one intervention against arrhythmia eg amiodarone, IV fluid or magnesium and 3857 67 had recurrent episodes of arrhythmia in ICU Patients with arrhythmias in ICU had higher 60day mortality 63 as compared to those without arrhythmias 39 CONCLUSION Newonset supraventricular arrhythmias were frequent in ICU patients with COVID19 and related to previous history of tachyarrhythmias and severity of the acute disease The mortality was high in these patients despite the frequent use of interventions against arrhythmias,Background Hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin was one of the common therapies at the beginning of the COVID19 pandemic They can prolong QT interval, cause torsade de pointes, and lead to sudden cardiac death We aimed to assess QT interval prolongation and its risk factors in patients who received hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin Methods This study was a retrospective cohort study One hundred seventytwo confirmed COVID19 patients were included in this study, hospitalized at Babol University of Medical Sciences hospitals between March 5, 2020, and April 3, 2020 Patients were divided into two groups hydroxychloroquine alone and hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin Electrocardiograms were used for outcome assessment Results 831 of patients received hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin vs 169 of patients who received only hydroxychloroquine The mean age of patients was 592  154The mean of posttreatment QTc interval in the monotherapy group was shorter than the mean of posttreatment QTc interval in the combination therapy group, but it had no significant statistical difference 4625  431 milliseconds vs 4643  591 milliseconds p  0488 Generally, 221 of patients had a prolonged QTc interval after treatment Male gender, or baseline QTc  450 milliseconds, or highrisk Tisdale score increased the likelihood of prolonged QTc interval Due to QTc prolongation, fourteen patients did not continue therapy after four days Conclusions Hospitalized patients treated by hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin had no significant difference in prolongation of QT interval and outcome The numbers of patients with prolonged QT intervals in this study emphasize careful cardiac monitoring during therapy, especially in highrisk patients,BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 19 COVID19 has many manifestations, including respiratory, thrombotic, neurologic, digestive, and cutaneous ones Cutaneous manifestations have been classified into 5 clinical patterns acroischemic pseudochilblain, vesicular, urticarial, maculopapular, and livedoid Oral manifestations have also been reported, but much less frequently PATIENTS AND METHODS We performed a crosssectional study in which we examined the oral mucosa of 666 patients with COVID19 at the IFEMA field hospital in Madrid in April 2020 RESULTS Seventyeight patients 117 had changes involving the oral mucosa The most common were transient anterior Ushaped lingual papillitis 115 accompanied or not by tongue swelling 66, aphthous stomatitis 69, a burning sensation in the mouth 53, mucositis 39, glossitis with patchy depapillation 39, white tongue 16, and enanthema 05 Most of the patients also reported taste disturbances CONCLUSIONS COVID19 also manifests in the oral cavity The most common manifestations are transient Ushaped lingual papillitis, glossitis with patchy depapillation, and burning mouth syndrome Mucositis with or without aphthous ulcers or enanthema may also be observed Any these findings may be key clues to a diagnosis of COVID19,,RATIONALE Asthma patients were advised to avoid Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 and comply to medication during COVID19 pandemic Respiratory tract infection is a common cause of asthma exacerbation There has not been evidence suggesting the link between COVID19 and asthma exacerbation, especially in places with dramatic responses in infection control with universal masking and aggressive social distancing OBJECTIVE To assess the number for admissions of asthma exacerbation in January to April 2020 in Hong Kong with reference to admission in past five years METHODS Admission records of asthma exacerbation were retrieved from Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System Patients with age at or above 18 years old with known history of asthma admitted for asthma exacerbation were included Loglinear was used to model count with year and masking used as covariate, with further analysis on ambient temperature, length of hospital stays Fisher exact test was used to compare the mortality rate and mechanical ventilation between the periods Admissions for myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and gastric ulcer were included as controls RESULTS The number of admissions for asthma exacerbation significantly decreased by 532 95CI 504558 in 2020 compared with monthly average admission in 20152019, with higher magnitude of decrease compared to control diagnoses Admissions for asthma exacerbation decreased by 20 95CI 1822 with every 1℃ 18°F increase in temperature and by 08 with every 1 increase in masking 95CI 0809 CONCLUSIONS Hospitalization number for asthma exacerbation significantly decreased in early 2020 with similar length of stay This was observed with concomitant practice of universal masking and social distancing during the COVID19 pandemic in Hong Kong We proposed that universal masking and social distancing reduced respiratory viral infection, leading to less hospital admission with asthma exacerbation,There is ongoing debate as to whether cardiac complications of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 result from myocardial viral infection or are secondary to systemic inflammation andor thrombosis We provide evidence that cardiomyocytes are infected in patients with COVID19 myocarditis and are susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 We establish an engineered heart tissue model of COVID19 myocardial pathology, define mechanisms of viral pathogenesis, and demonstrate that cardiomyocyte severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection results in contractile deficits, cytokine production, sarcomere disassembly, and cell death These findings implicate direct infection of cardiomyocytes in the pathogenesis of COVID19 myocardial pathology and provides a model system to study this emerging disease,,,BACKGROUND The Sars COV2 infection causing the covid19 disease has started in December 2019 inWuhan, China, then spread quickly to more than 100 countries in less than 3 months On March, 11th the WHO declared officially the pandemic of Covid 19 In the absence of an effective treatment of the SARSCov2 the measures of social distancing and lockdown remain the most effectives ways against the pandemic However, these measures can have repercussions in particular on patients followed for chronic diseases, the goal of our study will be to evaluate the impact of the lockdown on nonCovid cardiac patients METHODS We have chosen a random sample of patients followed in the cardiology department of the CHU Tangier Tetouan Alhouceima, and we collected their demographic data as well as the symptoms, vital constants, lifestyle before and 60 days after the lockdown RESULTS A total of 100 patients were included in the study The average age of our population is 5534 years1586 The average BMI body mass index is 2640 Kgm2584 The coronary artery disease was present in 27 of the patients, valvular disease in 40 and heart failure in 37 Finally, arrhythmias appear in 22 and more than the half of our sample has high blood pressure We noted a significant weight gain of 171 Kg P0000 after 60 days of lockdown, with an increase of BMI of 0,58xa0kgm2 P0,005 The percentage of patients with SBP systolic blood pressure 140mmHg has evolved from 38 to 44, thus an increase of 6xa0 P0,0001, while the percentage of the patients with DBP diastolic blood pressure 90mmHg has passed from 21 to 15xa0 thus a decrease of 6xa0, P0,0001 Twenty patients stop smoking, thus a decrease of 7 P0,0001 The sedentary lifestyle rate presented an elevation of 22 P0,0001 The daily calorie intake has increased of 35,4xa0 and 46,8xa0 of the patients increased their salt intake by more than 4xa0g per day The increase of the daily calorie intake concerned more the men than the women 41,9xa0 of men vs 31,3xa0 of the women In the population with high blood pressure, we have not observed a statistically significant difference of the SBP, the DBP and the heart rate between the beginning and two months after the lockdown Concerning patients with heart Failure, we have noted an worsen of the symptoms of HF Thus, 8,1 of the patients presenting a stage two dyspnea has passed to a stage three of the NYHA 32,4 vs 40,5, while the percentage of patients with lower limbs edema has increased of 13,5 but in a nonstatistically significant way P0,267 We have noticed a diet gap with an increase of salt intakes more than 4g per day in more than the half of this subpopulation 55,6xa0 during the period of the lockdown In the subpopulation of patients with valvular pathology, we have identified a worsening of the dyspnea in 7,5 of the patients this one has passed from stage two to stage three of the NHYA with an increase of the percentage of patients with lower limbs edema from 7,5 to 25 P0,065 Furthermore, we have noticed an incidence of 10 of cardiovascular events 2 cases of myocardial infarction among which one has deceased, one death because of end stage heart failure, three hospitalizations for congestive heart failure, two cases of aortic dissections and 2 cases of rapid atrial fibrillation OUR OBSERVATION Depending on the results of this study, the sanitary lockdown induced important repercussions on the patients followed for cardiac diseases, hence the necessity of an awareness of these patients, and mostly a restructuring of our care system strongly disturbed by the Covid 19,BACKGROUND Evidence suggests that vascular inflammation and thrombosis may be important drivers of poor clinical outcomes in patients with COVID19 We hypothesized that a significant decrease in the percentage of blood vessels with a crosssectional area between 1255u2005mm2 BV5 on chest computed tomography CT in COVID19 patients is predictive of adverse clinical outcomes METHODS Retrospective analysis of chest CT scans from 10 hospitals across two state in 313 COVID19 positive and 195 COVID19 negative patients seeking acute medical care RESULTS BV5 was predictive of outcomes in COVID19 patients in a multivariate model, with a BV5 threshold below 25 associated with an odds ratio OR 558 for death, OR 320 for intubation, and OR 254 for the composite of death or intubation A model using age and BV5 had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 085 to predict the composite of intubation or death in COVID19 patients BV5 was not predictive of clinical outcomes in patients without COVID19 CONCLUSION This data suggests BV5 as a novel biomarker for predicting adverse outcomes in patients with COVID19 seeking acute medical care,Coronaviruses disease 2019 COVID19 is the most crucial threat, the world has ever witnessed Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 is the causative agent of this disease pandemic The World Health Organization has confirmed the continuing epidemic as a worldwide public health crisis Presently, the research on COVID19 is even in the primitive stage Studies on unveiling the natural route of COVID19 infection and related pathophysiology, the biology of pulmonary airways pose a more rational restorative approach in the management of COVID19 Thus, based on the existing facts, we methodically reviewed the efforts put forth by various research institutes, pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology firms in pulmonary delivery to prevent and control the COVID19 This article would be valuable for the healthcare community, which is efficiently dealing with the SARSCoV2 crisis,INTRODUCTION To date, mainly due to agerelated vulnerability and to coexisting comorbidities, older patients often face a more severe COVID19 This study aimed to identify at Emergency Department ED admission the predictors of inhospital mortality and suitable scores for death risk stratification among COVID19 patients  80 years old METHODS Singlecentre prospective study conducted in the ED of an university hospital, referral center for COVID19 in central Italy We included 239 consecutive patients  80 years old with laboratoryconfirmed COVID19 The primary study endpoint was allcause inhospital mortality Multivariable Cox regression analysis was performed on significant variables at univariate analysis to identify independent risk factor for death Overall performance in predicting mortality of WHO severity scale, APACHE II score, NEWS score, and CURB65 was calculated RESULTS Median age was 85 8289 and 112 were males 469 Globally, 77 patients 322 deceased The presence of consolidations at chest xray and the hypoxemic respiratory failure were significant predictors of poor prognosis Moreover, age  85 years, dependency in activities of daily living ADL, and dementia were risk factors for death, even after adjusting for clinical covariates and disease severity All the evaluated scores showed a fairly good predictive value in identifying patients who could experience a worse outcome CONCLUSIONS Among patients  80 years old hospitalized with COVID19, not only a worse clinical and radiological presentation of the disease, but also the increasing age, dementia, and impairment in ADL were strong risk factors for inhospital death, regardless of disease severity,BACKGROUND Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 pandemic has led to a paradigm shift in healthcare worldwide Little is known about the impact on the cardiovascular system, and the incidence and consequences of new onset of atrial fibrillation AF in infected patients remain unclear The aim of this study was to analyze the cardiovascular outcomes of patients with newonset AF and coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 infection METHODS This observational study analyzed a sample of 160 consecutive patients hospitalized due to COVID19 A group with newonset AF n  12 was compared with a control group total n  148, sinus rhythm n  118, previous AF n  30 Newonset AF patients were significantly older and hypertensive, as well as presenting more frequently with a history of acute coronary syndrome and renal dysfunction This group showed a higher incidence of thromboembolic events 417 vs 41 p  0001, bleeding 333 vs 47, p  0005, a combined endpoint of thrombosis and death 583 vs 196, p  0006 and longer hospital stays 164 vs 86 days, p  0001, with no differences in allcause mortality RESULTS In multivariate analysis, adjusted by potential confounding factors, newonset AF demonstrated a 1426 odds ratio for thromboembolism 95 confidence interval 2867110, p  0001 CONCLUSIONS Newonset AF in COVID19 patients presumably has a notable impact on prognosis The appearance of newonset AF is related to worse cardiovascular outcomes, considering it as an independent predictor of embolic events Further studies are needed to identify patients with COVID19 at high risk of developing de novo AF, provide early anticoagulation and minimize the embolic risk of both entities,To perform a multicenter assessment of the CT Pneumonia Analysis prototype for predicting disease severity and patient outcome in COVID19 pneumonia both without and with integration of clinical information Our IRBapproved observational study included consecutive 241 adult patients u200918xa0years 105 females 136 males with RTPCRpositive COVID19 pneumonia who underwent noncontrast chest CT at one of the two tertiary care hospitals site A Massachusetts General Hospital, USA site B Firoozgar Hospital Iran We recorded patient age, gender, comorbid conditions, laboratory values, intensive care unit ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and final outcome recovery or death Two thoracic radiologists reviewed all chest CTs to record type, extent of pulmonary opacities based on the percentage of lobe involved, and severity of respiratory motion artifacts Thinsection CT images were processed with the prototype Siemens Healthineers to obtain quantitative features including lung volumes, volume and percentage of alltype and highattenuation opacities u2009200 HU, and mean HU and standard deviation of opacities within a given lung region These values are estimated for the total combined lung volume, and separately for each lung and each lung lobe Multivariable analyses of variance MANOVA and multiple logistic regression were performed for data analyses About 26 of chest CTs 62241 had moderate to severe motion artifacts There were no significant differences in the AUCs of quantitative features for predicting disease severity with and without motion artifacts AUC 094097 as well as for predicting patient outcome AUC 07077 pu2009u200905 Combination of the volume of allattenuation opacities and the percentage of highattenuation opacities AUC 076082, 95 confidence interval CI 073082 had higher AUC for predicting ICU admission than the subjective severity scores AUC 069077, 95 CI 069081 Despite a high frequency of motion artifacts, quantitative features of pulmonary opacities from chest CT can help differentiate patients with favorable and adverse outcomes,,,,Rationale Asthma is associated with chronic changes in the airway epithelium, a key target of SARSCoV2 Many epithelial changes are driven by the type 2 cytokine IL13, but the effects of IL13 on SARSCoV2 infection are unknown Objectives We sought to discover how IL13 and other cytokines affect expression of genes encoding SARSCoV2associated host proteins in human bronchial epithelial cells HBECs and determine whether IL13 stimulation alters susceptibility to SARSCoV2 infection Methods We used bulk and single cell RNAseq to identify cytokineinduced changes in SARSCoV2associated gene expression in HBECs We related these to gene expression changes in airway epithelium from individuals with mildmoderate asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD We analyzed effects of IL13 on SARSCoV2 infection of HBECs Measurements and Main Results Transcripts encoding 332 of 342 97 SARSCoV2associated proteins were detected in HBECs 1 RPM in 50 samples 41 12 of these mRNAs were regulated by IL13 15fold change, FDR  005 Many IL13regulated SARSCoV2associated genes were also altered in type 2 high asthma and COPD IL13 pretreatment reduced viral RNA recovered from SARSCoV2 infected cells and decreased dsRNA, a marker of viral replication, to below the limit of detection in our assay Mucus also inhibited viral infection Conclusions IL13 markedly reduces susceptibility of HBECs to SARSCoV2 infection through mechanisms that likely differ from those activated by type I interferons Our findings may help explain reports of relatively low prevalence of asthma in patients diagnosed with COVID19 and could lead to new strategies for reducing SARSCoV2 infection,,,,PURPOSE Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ARDS secondary to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 SARSCoV2 has demonstrated variable oxygenation and respiratorysystem mechanics without investigation of transpulmonary and chestwall mechanics This study describes lung, chest wall and respiratorysystem mechanics in patients with SARSCoV2 and ARDS METHODS Data was collected from forty patients with confirmed SARSCoV2 and ARDS at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts Esophageal balloons were placed to estimate pleural and transpulmonary pressures Clinical characteristics, respiratorysystem, transpulmonary, and chestwall mechanics were measured over the first week RESULTS Patients had moderatesevere ARDS PaO2FiO2 12398149 and were critically ill APACHE IV 108 94128 and SOFA 12 1113 PaO2FiO2 improved over the first week 150xa0mmHg 1229182 to 185xa0mmHg 138228 pxa0xa00035 Respiratory system 3035xa0mlcm H2O, lung 4050xa0mlcm H2O and chest wall 120150xa0mlcm H2O compliance remained similar over the first week Elevated basal pleural pressures correlated with BMI Patients required prolonged mechanical ventilation 145xa0days 95190, with a mortality of 325 CONCLUSIONS Patients displayed normal chestwall mechanics, with increased basal pleural pressure Respiratory system and lung mechanics were similar to known existing ARDS cohorts The wide range of respiratory system mechanics illustrates the inherent heterogeneity that is consistent with typical ARDS,,At the end of 2019, respiratory coronavirus diseases 2019 COVID19 appeared and spread rapidly in the world Besides several mutations, the outcome of this pandemic was the death up to 15 of hospitalized patients Mesenchymal stromal cell therapy as a therapeutic strategy seemed successful in treatment of several diseases Not only mesenchymal stromal cells of several tissues, but also their secreted extracellular vesicles and even secretome indicated beneficial therapeutic function All of these three options were studied for treatment of COVID19 as well as those respiratory diseases that have similar symptom Fortunately, most of the outcomes were promising and optimistic In this paper, we review invivo and clinical studies which have been used different sources of mesenchymal stromal cell, secreted extracellular vesicles, and secretome to improve and treat symptoms of COVID19 and similar lung diseases This article is protected by copyright All rights reserved,Despite recent advances in using biologicals that target Th2 pathways, glucocorticoids form the mainstay of asthma treatment Asthma morbidity and mortality remain high due to the wide variability of treatment responsiveness and complex clinical phenotypes driven by distinct underlying mechanisms Emerging evidence suggests that inhalation of the toxic air pollutant, ozone, worsens asthma by impairing glucocorticoid responsiveness This review discusses the role of oxidative stress in glucocorticoid resistance in asthma The underlying mechanisms point to a central role of oxidative stress pathways The primary data source for this review consisted of peerreviewed publications on the impact of ozone on airway inflammation and glucocorticoid responsiveness indexed in PubMed Our main search strategy focused on crossreferencing asthma and glucocorticoid resistance against ozone, oxidative stress, alarmins, innate lymphoid, NK and γδ T cells, dendritic cells and alveolar type II epithelial cells, glucocorticoid receptor and transcription factors Recent work was placed in the context from articles in the last 10 years and older seminal research papers and comprehensive reviews We excluded papers that did not focus on respiratory injury in the setting of oxidative stress The pathways discussed here have however wide clinical implications to pathologies associated with inflammation and oxidative stress and in which glucocorticoid treatment is essential,Purpose The purpose of this study was to pilot a homebased pulmonary rehabilitation PR program administered via a telemedicine approach using a combination of fitness application and selfselected activity in lung transplant candidates with cystic fibrosis CF Methods We recruited adult patients with CF The main outcome was adherence, measured by number of sessions completed in 12 weeks Secondary outcomes were adverse events, sixminute walk distance 6MWD, and dyspnea Participants were provided a personalized exercise program and equipment including a fitness application that provided exercise videos, recorded exercise time, and corresponding heart rate We reviewed data daily and provided text messages with feedback We compared our study outcomes to a retrospective data set of CF patients who participated in a 24session outpatient hospitalbased PR program Data presented as   mean  standard   deviation    Results Eleven patients participated in the home PR program, 45 female, age   33  7   years   , FEV1   27  5    predicted Sessions completed were   19  12   homebased PR vs   9  4   hospitalbased PR,   p  03    Fifty percent of the homebased group completed 24 sessions in 12 weeks versus 0 of the hospitalbased patients    p  03    There were no adverse events during exercise Completers of the homebased program demonstrated a clinically meaningful lower decline in 6 MWD than noncompleters 6MWD    7  15   vs    86  108   meters    Only one participant performed a post 6 MWD in the hospitalbased PR Conclusion Patients with severe CF demonstrated adherence to home PR delivered using fitness application and selfselected activity with no adverse events This program style may be a viable solution for telerehabilitation in severe CF and is particularly relevant in the COVID era,,In this study, we developed ACE2specific, peptidederived 68Galabeled radiotracers, motivated by the hypotheses that 1 ACE2 is an important determinant of SARSCoV2 susceptibility, and 2 that modulation of ACE2 in COVID19 drives severe organ injury Methods A series of NOTAconjugated peptides derived from the known ACE2 inhibitor DX600 were synthesized, with variable linker identity Since DX600 bears two cystine residues, both linear and cyclic peptides were studied An ACE2 inhibition assay was used to identify lead compounds, which were labeled with 68Ga to generate peptide radiotracers 68GaNOTAPEP The aminocaproatederived radiotracer 68GaNOTAPEP4 was subsequently studied in a humanized ACE2 hACE2 transgenic model Results Cyclic DX600 derived peptides had markedly lower IC50s than their linear counterparts The three cyclic peptides with triglycine, aminocaproate, and polyethylene glycol linkers had calculated IC50s similar to, or lower than the parent DX600 molecule Peptides were readily labeled with 68Ga, and the biodistribution of 68GaNOTAPEP4 was determined in a hACE2 transgenic murine cohort Pharmacologic concentrations of coadministered NOTAPEP blocking showed significant reduction of 68GaNOTAPEP4 signals in the in the heart, liver, lungs, and small intestine Ex vivo hACE2 activity in these organs was confirmed as a correlate to in vivo results Conclusion NOTAconjugated, cyclic peptides derived from the known ACE2 inhibitor DX600 retain their activity when Nconjugated for 68Ga chelation In vivo studies in a transgenic hACE2 murine model using the lead tracer 68GaNOTAPEP4 showed specific binding in the heart, liver, lungs and intestine  organs known to be affected in SARSCoV2 infection These results suggest that 68GaNOTAPEP4 could be used to detect organspecific suppression of ACE2 in SARSCoV2 infected murine models and COVID19 patients,Pulmonary disease in liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension constitutes a challenging clinical scenario and may have important implications with regard to prognosis, liver transplantation LT candidacy and postLT outcome PreLT evaluation should include adequate screening for pulmonary diseases that may occur concomitantly with liver disease as well as for those that may arise as a complication of endstage liver disease and portal hypertension, as either may jeopardize safe LT and successful outcome It is key to discriminate those patients who would benefit from LT, especially pulmonary disorders that have been reported to resolve postLT and are considered pulmonary indications for transplant, from those who are at increased mortality risk and in whom LT is contraindicated In conclusion, in this manuscript, we review the impact of several pulmonary disorders, including cystic fibrosis, alpha 1antitrypsin deficiency, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, sarcoidosis, COVID19, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary nodules, interstitial lung disease, hepatic hydrothorax, hepatopulmonary syndrome and portopulmonary hypertension, on postLT survival, as well as the reciprocal impact of LT on the evolution of lung function,,OBJECTIVE The COVID19 pandemic requires thinking about alternatives to establish ECMO when oftenlimited hardware resources are exhausted Heartlungmachines may potentially be used for ECMO but contain roller pumps as compared to centrifugal pumps in ECMOcircuits We here tested roller pumps as rescue pump for ECMOestablishment METHODS We set up in vitro circuits on roller pumps from C5 heartlungmachine with 5u2009lminutes flow In two series, we placed either PVC or silicon tubing for an ECMO circuit into the roller pump We assessed the mechanical stress on the tubing aiming to run the pump for at least 1u2009week, measured the temperature increase generated by the friction and assessed flow characteristics and its measurement in simulated situations resembling tube kinking and suction RESULTS The roller pumps led to expected and unexpected adverse events PVC tubing burst between 36 and 78u2009hours, while silicon tubing lasted for at least 7u2009days At 7u2009days, the silicone tubing showed significant signs of roller pump wear visible on the outside The inside, however, was free of surface irregularities Using these tubings in a roller pump led to a remarkable increase in circuit temperature PVC 120°C, silicone 29°C Kinking or suction on the device caused the expected dramatic flow reduction as assessed by direct measurement while the roller pump display continued to show the preset flow The roller pump is therefore not able to reliably determine the true flow rate CONCLUSION Roller pumps with silicone tubing but not PVC tubing may be used for running ECMO circuits Silicone tubing may endure the roller pump shear forces for up to 1u2009week Thus, repeated tubing repositioning may be a solution Circuit heating and substantial limitations in flow detection should increase attention if clinical use in situations of crisis is considered,Background Cystic fibrosis CF is a potentially mortal disease characterized by a chronic pulmonary disease with persistent airway infection Children with this disease are more susceptible to respiratory infections due to the limitation in mucociliary transport and anatomical disruption of the bronchial tree SARSCoV2 causes COVID19, a respiratory illness related to exacerbations of chronic pulmonary pathologies in children, such as CF and asthma There are not enough case reports on pediatric patients with SARSCoV2 infection and CF, for which we share our experience Case report A 22monthold male patient diagnosed with CF presented in the hospital with cough, fever, and increased respiratory work The patient received supplemental oxygen and antibiotic and antiviral therapy Positive results for type B influenza and RTPCR reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction for SARSCoV2 were obtained Due to the persistence of respiratory difficulty, highflow therapy was initiated, with a good response After an episode of hypoxemia, bradycardia, and increased respiratory work secondary to accumulated secretions, orotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation were performed The patient evolved with clinical and gasometric improvement After 10 days of inhospital antibiotic management with adequate clinical evolution, the patient was discharged to complete oral treatment and home isolation Conclusions We present a case of chronic respiratory disease and SARSCoV2 infection with severity criteria in a pediatric patient The evolution was favorable with timely support management and antibiotic therapy in a thirdlevel hospital,SARSCoV2 is a novel coronavirus that resulted in a worldwide pandemic of coronavirus diseases 2019 COVID19 The severity of symptomatic infection caused by SARSCoV2 in adults ranges from mil,Sickle cell disease SCD is an inherited monogenic hemoglobinopathy characterized by formation of sickle erythrocytes under conditions of deoxygenation Sickle erythrocytes can lead to thrombus formation and vasoocclusive episodes that may result in hemolytic anemia, pain crisis and multiple organ damage Moreover, SCD is characterized by endothelial damage, increased inflammatory response, platelet activation and aggravation, and activation of both the intrinsic and the extrinsic coagulation pathways Cerebrovascular events constitute an important clinical complication of SCD Children with SCD have a 300fold higher risk of acute stroke and by the age of 45 about 25 of patients have suffered an overt stoke Management and prevention of stroke in patients with SCD is not well defined Moreover, the presence of patent foramen ovale PFO increases the risk of the occurrence of an embolic cerebrovascular event The role of PFO closure and antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy has not been well investigated Moreover, during COVID19 pandemic and taking into account the increased rates of thrombotic events and the difficulties in blood transfusion, management of SCD patients is even more challenging and difficult, since data are scarce regarding stroke occurrence and management in this specific population in the COVID19 era This review focuses on pathophysiology of stroke in patients with SCD and possible treatment strategies in the presence of PFO,BACKGROUND Immune checkpoint inhibitors ICIs are being used after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation alloHCT to reverse immune dysfunction However, a major concern for the use of ICIs after alloHCT is the increased risk of graftversushost disease GVHD We analyzed the association between GVHD prophylaxis and frequency of GVHD in patients who had received ICI therapy after alloHCT METHODS A retrospective study was performed in 21 patients with acute myeloid leukemia n16 or myelodysplastic syndromes n5 who were treated with antiprogrammed cell death protein 1 16 patients or anticytotoxic T lymphocyteassociated antigen 4 5 patients therapy for disease relapse after alloHCT Associations between the type of GVHD prophylaxis and incidence of GVHD were analyzed RESULTS Four patients 19 developed acute GVHD The incidence of acute GVHD was associated only with the type of posttransplantation GVHD prophylaxis none of the other variables included stem cell source, donor type, age at alloHCT, conditioning regimen and prior history of GVHD were associated with the frequency of acute GVHD Twelve patients received posttransplantation cyclophosphamide PTCy for GVHD prophylaxis Patients who received PTCy had a significantly shorter median time to initiation of ICI therapy after alloHCT compared with patients who did not receive PTCy median 51 months compared with 266 months Despite early ICI therapy initiation, patients who received PTCy had a lower observed cumulative incidence of grades 24 acute GVHD compared with patients who did not receive PTCy 16 compared with 22 p07 After controlling for comorbidities and time from alloHCT to ICI therapy initiation, the analysis showed that PTCy was associated with a 90 reduced risk of acute GVHD HR 01, 95 CI 002 to 06, p001 CONCLUSIONS ICI therapy for relapsed acute myeloid leukemiamyelodysplastic syndromes after alloHCT may be a safe and feasible option PTCy appears to decrease the incidence of acute GVHD in this cohort of patients,The lungs are directly connected to the external environment, which makes them more vulnerable to infection and injury They are protected by the respiratory epithelium and immune cells to maintain a dynamic balance Both innate and adaptive immune cells are involved in the pathogenesis of lung diseases Mucosalassociated invariant T MAIT cells are a subset of unconventional T cells, which have attracted increasing attention in recent years Although MAIT cells account for a small part of the total immune cells in the lungs, evidence suggests that these cells are activated by T cell receptors andor cytokine receptors and mediate immune response They play an important role in immunosurveillance and immunity against microbial infection, and recent studies have shown that subsets of MAIT cells play a role in promoting pulmonary inflammation Emerging data indicate that MAIT cells are involved in the immune response against SARSCoV2 and possible immunopathogenesis in COVID19 Here, we introduce MAIT cell biology to clarify their role in the immune response Then we review MAIT cells in human and murine lung diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis and lung cancer, and discuss their possible protective and pathological effects MAIT cells represent an attractive marker and potential therapeutic target for disease progression, thus providing new strategies for the treatment of lung diseases,INTRODUCTION Respiratory infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality As an alternative to systemic drug administration, inhaled drug delivery can produce high drug concentrations in the lung tissue to overcome resistant bacteria The development of inhaled fixeddose combination powders IFDCs is promising next step in this field, as it would enable simultaneous drugdrug or drugadjuvant delivery at the site of infection, thereby promoting synergistic activity and improving patient compliance AREAS COVERED This review covers the clinical and pharmaceutical rationales for the development of IFDCs for the treatment of respiratory infections, relevant technologies for particle and powder generation, and obstacles which must be addressed to achieve regulatory approval EXPERT OPINION IFDCs have been widely successful in the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease however, application of IFDCs towards the treatment of respiratory infections carries additional challenges related to the high dose requirements and physicochemical characteristics of antiinfective drugs At present, cospray drying is an especially promising approach for the development of composite fixeddose antiinfective particles for inhalation Though the majority of fixeddose research has thus far focused on the combination of multiple antibiotics, future work may shift to the additional inclusion of immunomodulatory agents or repurposed nonantibiotics,INTRODUCTION Atherosclerosis, inflammation, and vascular stiffness are prominent interrelated risk factors contributing to the high incidence of cardiovascular disease CVD in patients with CKD Conventional CVD management strategies in CKD largely target atherosclerotic CVD and have had a limited impact on the cardiovascular mortality in this population Multiple in vivo and in vitro studies and epidemiological evidence from the rheumatologic cohorts have shown that lowdose hydroxychloroquine has beneficial effects on inflammation, endothelial function, insulin sensitivity, and metabolic syndrome Our recent proofofconcept animal study showed that hydroxychloroquine has marked protection against atherosclerosis and vascular stiffness We hypothesize that hydroxychloroquine has the potential to provide significant cardiovascular benefits in patients with CKD METHODS The Management of Cardiovascular disease in Kidney disease study NCT03636152 is a phase 2B, randomized, doubleblind, placebocontrolled trial evaluating the effects of lowdose hydroxychloroquine therapy on the parameters of atherosclerosis, inflammation, and vascular stiffness in patients with CKD The study plans to enroll 100 CKD patients estimated to be at high cardiovascular risk by a combination of low estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria and treat them for 18 months with hydroxychloroquine or placebo in 11 allocation RESULTS The study will assess the change in the total carotid plaque volume as measured by serial noncontrast carotid MRI as the primary outcome and the serial changes in plasma inflammation markers, vascular stiffness, renal function, and the composition characteristics of the carotid plaque as secondary outcome measures DISCUSSIONCONCLUSION The results of this trial will provide the proofofapplicability for hydroxychloroquine in the CVD in CKD If positive, this trial should lead to phase3 trials with clinical end points for this potentially transformative, novel, and inexpensive therapy for CVD in CKD,Cardiovascular implantable electronic devices have revolutionized the management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction New device generations tend to be launched every few years, with incremental improvements in performance and safety and with an expectation that these will improve patient management and outcomes while remaining costeffective As a result, todays cardiac resynchronization therapy CRT and implantable cardioverter defibrillator devices are quite different from the pioneering but often bulky devices of the late 20th century This review discusses new and improved features developed to target specific needs in managing heart failure patients, some of which are especially pertinent to the current worldwide healthcare situation, with focus on the latest generation of CRTs with defibrillator CRTDs and implantable cardioverter defibrillators from Medtronic,Haemolytic uraemic syndrome HUS is a thrombotic microangiopathy TMA that presents with renal insufficiency, thrombocytopaenia and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia Typical HUS is associated with Shiga toxin while atypical HUS aHUS is due to overactivation of the alternative complement pathway aHUS has numerous causes, including drugs, with rare reports of carfilzomib, a proteasome inhibitor used in multiple myeloma, as causative agent Cases vary in presentation, presenting a diagnostic challenge Historically, TMAs were treated with plasma exchange aHUS, however, is considered refractory to plasma exchange and best treated with eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting C5, a terminal complement protein We report a patient with history of multiple myeloma who presented with headaches, elevated blood pressure, petechiae, ecchymosis and haemolytic anaemia His condition was determined to be carfilzomibinduced aHUS and he was successfully treated with eculizumab Early detection and treatment of druginduced aHUS is vital in reducing morbidity and mortality related to the condition,Ultrasonography has proven useful in the study of many pulmonary diseases that affect the subpleural regions This article reviews the current evidence regarding the role of ultrasonography in the diagnosis and management of viral lung infections It describes the examination technique and the main ultrasonographic findings for different viruses that can affect the lungs,,The COVID19 pandemic continues to exert destructive effects on the health and wellbeing of the global population Previous studies show that screening helps us identify COVID19 and provides opportunity to isolate infected patients and put them under treatment Patients infected with prevalent types of chest infections are frequently misdiagnosed with COVID19 Motivated by this, in the current study, a novel deep residual COVIDNet architecture for identification of COVID19 using raw chest Xray images is presented According to the results, the proposed model was able to identify COVID19, pneumonia, and normal cases with a classification accuracy of 9965 The proposed model has also demonstrated a superiority in terms of sensitivity, specificity, precision, and f1score and attained the results of 99, 9937, 99, and 99, respectively Additionally, DRCOVIDNet was validated on the chest Xray images obtained from 19 patients at Namazi hospital in Iran It was able to identify 1213 COVID19 cases correctly with an accuracy of 84 The ResNet50 was used as a based architecture in our study From these experiments and evaluations, we can conclude that the proposed model can reliably be employed to assist radiologists in validating their initial screening and also utilize via cloud as a CAD system,A COVID19 diagnosis is usually based on PCR detection of viral RNA in airway specimens in a patient with typical clinical features Histological features of the COVID19 lung disease are reported from autopsies Transbronchial cryobiopsy TBCB is an evolving technique usually performed in the diagnosis of interstitial lung disease We report a TBCB in a 76yearold female patient who had repeatedly tested negative for SARSCoV2 infection The pathological examination revealed the presence of interstitial pneumonia with lymphocytic infiltration The qRTPCR against SARSCoV2 from a pharyngeal swab was positive after performing the TBCB,,BACKGROUND Though imaging manifestations of COVID19 and other types of viral pneumonia are similar, their clinical treatment methods differ Accurate, noninvasive diagnostic methods using CT imaging can help developing an optimal therapeutic regimen for both conditions OBJECTIVES To compare the initial CT imaging features in COVID19 with those in other types of viral pneumonia METHODS Clinical and imaging data of 51 patients with COVID19 and 69 with other types of viral pneumonia were retrospectively studied All significant imaging features Youden index 03 were included for constituting the combined criteria for COVID19 diagnosis, composed of two or more imaging features with a parallel model McNemars chisquare test or Fishers exact test was used to compare the validity indices sensitivity and specificity among various criteria RESULTS Ground glass opacities GGO dominated density, peripheral distribution, unilateral lung, clear margin of lesion, rounded morphology, long axis parallel to the pleura, vascular thickening, and crazypaving pattern were more common in COVID19 p 005 Consolidationdominated density, both central and peripheral distribution, bilateral lung, indistinct margin of lesion, treeinbud pattern, mediastinal or hilar lymphadenectasis, pleural effusion, and pleural thickening were more common in other types of viral pneumonia p  005 GGOdominated density or long axis parallel to the pleura with the highest sensitivity, and GGOdominated density or long axis parallel to the pleura or vascular thickening with the highest specificity are good combined criteria of COVID19 CONCLUSION The initial CT imaging features are helpful for differential diagnosis between COVID19 and other types of viral pneumonia,The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 has been frequently associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome In this case report, an atypical presentation of COVID19 in young with a thromboembolic event is reported The patient initially presented with fever of unknown origin not responding to therapy On examination, visual acuity was 2020 in both eyes with bilateral disc oedema and disc haemorrhage in the right eye Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, Creactive protein and DDimer were elevated Magnetic resonance venography MRV revealed features suggestive of cerebral venous thrombosis Timely diagnosis and intervention have prevented a fatal outcome,Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 has become a worldwide pandemic responsible for millions of deaths around the world Hypertension has been identified as one of the most common comorbidities and risk factors for severity and adverse outcome in these patients Recent investigations have raised the question whether hypertension represents a predictor of outcome in COVID19 patients independently of other common comorbidities such as diabetes, obesity, other cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney, liver, and pulmonary diseases However, the impact of chronic and newly diagnosed hypertension in COVID19 patients has been insufficiently investigated The same is true for the relationship between blood pressure levels and outcomes in COVID19 patients It seems that the long discussion about the impact of angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors ACEI and blockers of angiotensin I receptors ARB on severity and outcome in COVID19 is approaching an end because the large number of original studies and metaanalyses discarded the initial findings about higher prevalence of ACEIARB use in patients with unfavorable outcomes Nevertheless, there are many controversies in the relationship between hypertension and COVID19 The aim of this review article is to provide a clinical overview of the currently available evidence regarding the predictive value of hypertension, the effect of blood pressure levels, the impact of previously known and newly diagnosed hypertension, and the effect of antihypertensive therapy on the severity and outcomes in COVID19 patients,Because of the rapid and serious nature of acute cardiovascular disease CVD especially ST segment elevation myocardial infarction STEMI, a leading cause of death worldwide, prompt diagnosis and treatment is of crucial importance to reduce both mortality and morbidity During a pandemic such as coronavirus disease2019 COVID19, it is critical to balance cardiovascular emergencies with infectious risk In this work, we recommend using wearable device based mobile health mHealth as an early screening and realtime monitoring tool to address this balance and facilitate remote monitoring to tackle this unprecedented challenge This recommendation may help to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of acute CVD patient management while reducing infection risk,BACKGROUND It is unclear if there is the influence of asthma on contracting COVID19, or having worse outcomes from COVID19 disease OBJECTIVE To explore the prevalence of asthma in COVID19 patients and the relationship between asthma and COVID19 patients with poor outcomes METHODS The pooled prevalence of asthma in COVID19 patients and corresponding 95 confidence interval CI were estimated The pooled effect size ES was used to evaluate the association between asthma and COVID19 patients with poor outcomes RESULTS The pooled prevalence of asthma in COVID19 patients worldwide was 83 95 CI 7690 based on 116 articles 119 studies with 403,392 cases The pooled ES based on unadjusted effect estimates showed that asthma was not associated with the reduced risk of poor outcomes in COVID19 patients ES 091, 95 CI 078106 Similarly, the pooled ES based on unadjusted effect estimates revealed that asthma was not associated with the reduced risk of mortality in COVID19 patients ES 088, 95 CI 073105 However, the pooled ES based on adjusted effect estimates indicated that asthma was significantly associated with the reduced risk of mortality in COVID19 patients ES 080, 95 CI 074086 CONCLUSION The pooled prevalence of asthma in COVID19 patients was similar to that in the general population, and asthma might be an independent protective factor for the death of COVID19 patients, which suggests that we should pay high attention to COVID19 patients with asthma and take locally tailored interventions and treatment Further welldesigned studies with large sample sizes are required to verify our findings,Placement of a doublelumen tube to achieve one lung ventilation is an aerosolgenerating procedure Performing it on a patient with COVID19 will put healthcare workers at high risk of contracting the disease We herein report a case of its use in a patient with traumatic diaphragmatic rupture, who was also suspected to have COVID19 This article aims to highlight the issues, it presented and ways to address them as well as the perioperative impact of personal protective equipment,COVID19 infection is a new disease mainly affecting the respiratory system but is also accompanied by many extrapulmonary manifestations A case of a 47year old male with unique myocardial fibrosis after COVID19 infection involving the left ventricular wall, intraventricular septum and almost complete damage of interatrial septum, in combination with asymptomatic severe sinus arrest episodes related to mild obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is described here,BACKGROUND This qualitative research explored the lived experiences of patients who experienced postponement of elective cardiac and vascular surgery due to coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 We know very little about patients during the novel coronavirus pandemic Understanding the patient voice may play an important role in prioritization of postponed cases and triage moving forward METHODS Utilizing a hermeneutical phenomenological qualitative design, we interviewed 47 individuals who experienced a postponement of cardiac or vascular surgery due to the COVID19 pandemic Data were analyzed and informed by phenomenological research methods RESULTS Patients in our study described 3 key issues around their postponement of elective surgery Patients described robust narratives about the meanings of their elective surgeries as the chance to return to normal and alleviate symptoms that impacted everyday life Second, because of the meanings most of our patients ascribed to their surgeries, postponement often took a toll on how patients managed physical health and emotional wellbeing Finally, paradoxically, many patients in our study were demonstrative that they would rather die from a heart attack than be exposed to the coronavirus CONCLUSIONS We identified several components of the patient experience, encompassing quality of life and other desired benefits of surgery, the risks of COVID, and difficulty reconciling the 2 Our study provides significant qualitative evidence to inform providers of important considerations when rescheduling the backlog of patients The emotional and psychological distress that patients experienced due to postponement may also require additional considerations in postoperative recovery,BACKGROUND As the pandemic continues to unfold, effective, technologybased solutions are needed to help patients with atrial fibrillation AF maintain their health and wellbeing during the outbreak of COVID19 METHODS This singlecenter, pilot study investigated the effects of a 4week eight sessions virtual AF selfmanagement program Questionnaires were completed at baseline and 1xa0week after the intervention, and assessed AF knowledge, adherence to selfmanagement behaviors, mental health, physical function, and diseasespecific quality of life in patients with AF Secondary outcomes included knowledge of COVID19, intervention, acceptability, and satisfaction RESULTS Of 68 patients who completed baseline questionnaires, 57 participated in the intervention and were included in the analysis mean age of 734  100 years, 60 male Adherence to AF selfmonitoring behaviors, including monitoring their heart rate p,Rationale Obstructive sleep apnea OSA may contribute to poor outcomes in adults with Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID19 Objective To determine the effect of OSA on clinical outcomes in patients with COVID19 Methods The current prospective observational study was conducted in three hospitals in Istanbul, Turkey from March 10 to June 22, 2020 The participants were categorized as modified highrisk mHR, or lowrisk mLROSA according to a modified version of the Berlin questionnaire Snoring patterns intensity andor frequency, breathing pauses and morningdaytime sleepiness, without taking obesity and hypertension into account, were used in the regression models Results The primary outcome was clinical improvement defined as a decline of 2 categories from admission on a 7category ordinal scale Secondary outcomes included worsening increase of 1 category, need for hospitalization, supplemental oxygen and intensive care In total, 320 eligible patients were enrolled According to the modified scoring, 70 219 had mHROSA Among 242 patients requiring hospitalization, clinical improvement within 2 weeks occurred in 754  of the mHROSA group compared to 884  of the modified lowrisk mLROSA group P  0014 In multivariate regression analyses, mHROSA adjusted OR 042 95 CI 019092 predicted the delayed clinical improvement In the entire study population n320, mHROSA was associated with clinical worsening and need for supplemental oxygen Snoring patterns, especially louder snoring, were significantly predicted delayed clinical improvement, worsening, need for hospitalization, supplemental oxygen, and intensive care Conclusions Adults with mHROSA in our Covid19 cohort had poorer clinical outcomes than those with mLR OSA independent of age, sex and comorbidities Clinical trial registered with ClinicalTrialsgov NCT04363333,,,Prevalent coagulopathy and thromboembolism are observed in severe COVID19 patients with 40 of COVID19 mortality being associated with cardiovascular complications Abnormal coagulation parameters are related to poor prognosis in COVID19 patients Victims also displayed presence of extensive thrombosis in infected lungs Vitamin K is wellknown to play an essential role in the coagulation system Latest study revealed an existing correlation between vitamin K deficiency and COVID19 severity, highlighting a role of vitamin K, probably via coagulation modulation In agreement, other recent studies also indicated that anticoagulant treatments can reduce mortality in severe cases Altogether, potential mechanisms linking COVID19 with coagulopathy in which vitamin K may exert its modulating role in coagulation related with disease pathogenesis are established In this review, we discuss the recent evidence supporting COVID19 as a vascular disease and explore the potential benefits of using vitamin K against COVID19 to improve disease outcomes,,Aim Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2 has a significant physiological role in the renin  angiotensin  aldosterone system RAAS pathway The ACE2 receptor acts as a virus receptor in the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 disease In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of ACEIs use on radiological imaging and clinical course in COVID19 Methods In this study, patients who had been using medications for the diagnosis of hypertension and who were hospitalized in Haydarpasa Numune Training and Research Hospital due to COVID19 pneumonia were retrospectively evaluated Results The mean age of 107 patients included in this study was 68,4911,95, and 505 n  54 of them were male The patients were divided into two separate study groups as ACEIs users and nonusers In the first of these groups, 55 patients were using ACEIs due to hypertension In the second group, 52 patients were using calcium channel blockers CCBs, βblockers, alpha2 blockers, or diuretics, alone or in combination When the lung computed tomography images were examined, multilobar findings were less common in the ACEIs group, which was remarkable p 0001 When the clinical endpoint was evaluated, the findings showed that the mortality rates were different in the groups ACEIs users and nonusers 127 vs 327, respectively, p0013 Conclusion Although the role of RAAS blockade in COVID19 is still not fully elucidated, we have shown that COVID19 progresses with less damage in the lungs with patients who have been using ACEIs,BackgroundLung perfusion defects PDs have been described in COVID19 using dualenergy computed tomography pulmonary angiography DECTPA We assessed the prevalence and characteristics of PDs in COVID19 patients with suspected pulmonary embolism PE and negative CTPA MethodsThis retrospective study included COVID19 and nonCOVID19 pneumonia groups of patients with DECTPA negative for PE Two radiologists rated the presence of PD within the lung opacities and analyzed the type of lung opacities and PD pattern ie homogeneous or heterogeneous The clinical, biological, radiological characteristics including time from first symptoms and admission to DECTPA, oxygen requirements, CRP, Ddimer levels, duration of hospital admission and death were compared within the COVID19 group between patients with PDu2009 or without PD PDResults67 COVID19 and 79 nonCOVID19 patients were included PDs were more frequent in the COVID19 than in the nonCOVID19 group 597 and 266 respectively, p,Fibrosis progression in the lung commonly results in impaired functional gas exchange, respiratory failure, or even death In addition to the aberrant activation and differentiation of lung fibroblasts, persistent alveolar injury and incomplete repair are the driving factors of lung fibrotic response Macrophages are activated and polarized in response to lipopolysaccharide or bleomycininduced lung injury The classically activated macrophage M1 and alternatively activated macrophage M2 have been extensively investigated in lung injury, repair, and fibrosis In the present review, we summarized the current data on monocytederived macrophages that are recruited to the lung, as well as alveolar resident macrophages and their polarization, pyroptosis, and phagocytosis in acute lung injury ALI Additionally, we described how macrophages interact with lung epithelial cells during lung repair Finally, we emphasized the role of macrophage polarization in the pulmonary fibrotic response, and elucidated the potential benefits of targeting macrophage in alleviating pulmonary fibrosis,,Treatment options in multiple myeloma MM are increasing with the introduction of complex multinovelagentbased regimens investigated in randomized clinical trials However, application in the realworld setting, including feasibility of and adherence to these regimens, may be limited due to varying patient, treatment, and diseaserelated factors Furthermore, approximately 40 of realworld MM patients do not meet the criteria for phase 3 studies on which approvals are based, resulting in a lack of representative phase 3 data for these patients Therefore, treatment decisions must be tailored based on additional considerations beyond clinical trial efficacy and safety, such as treatment feasibility including frequency of clinichospital attendance, tolerability, effects on quality of life QoL, and impact of comorbidities There are multiple factors of importance to realworld MM patients, including disease symptoms, treatment burden and toxicities, ability to participate in daily activities, financial burden, access to treatment and treatment centers, and convenience of treatment All of these factors are drivers of QoL and treatment satisfactioncompliance Importantly, given the heterogeneity of MM, individual patients may have different perspectives regarding the most relevant considerations and goals of their treatment Patient perspectivesgoals may also change as they move through their treatment course Thus, the efficacy of treatment means different things to different patients, and treatment decisionmaking in the context of personalized medicine must be guided by an individuals composite definition of what constitutes the best treatment choice This review summarizes the various factors of importance and practical issues that must be considered when determining realworld treatment choices It assesses the current instruments, methodologies, and recent initiatives for analyzing the MM patient experience Finally, it suggests options for enhancing data collection on patients and treatments to provide a more holistic definition of the effectiveness of a regimen in the realworld setting,A 59yearold male with a history of gallbladder adenocarcinoma receiving chemotherapy and on therapeutic anticoagulation for portal vein thrombosis presented to the emergency department via ambulance after being found unresponsive and in cardiac arrest Initial workup upon return of spontaneous circulation revealed a large right atrial mass, patent foramen ovale PFO, and bilateral acute cortical infarctions This constellation of findings were concerning for PFOrelated paradoxical embolic strokes Given the risk of recurrent paradoxical embolic events and the absolute contraindication to thrombolysis due to recent cerebral infarction, the decision was made to proceed with percutaneous vacuumassisted thrombectomy using the AngioVac device To prevent intraoperative thrombus propagation, PFOclosure was performed immediately prior to thrombectomy Aspiration thrombectomy and PFOclosure were successful with complete thrombus removal and no intraoperative thrombus propagation This case presents a minimally invasive and rapid treatment for a complex problem An efficient and effective interdisciplinary teambased approach allowed the patient to resume cancer treatment relatively unabated,Type 2 inflammation is found in most forms of asthma, which may coexist with recurrent viral infections, bacterial colonization, and host cell death These processes drive the accumulation of intracellular cyclicdinucleotides such as cyclicdiGMP CDG Group 2 innate lymphoid cells ILC2s are critical drivers of type 2 lung inflammation during fungal allergen exposure in mice however, it is unclear how CDG regulates lung ILC responses during lung inflammation Here, we show that intranasal CDG induced early airway type 1 interferon IFN production and dramatically suppressed CD127ST2 ILC2s and type 2 lung inflammation during Alternaria and IL33 exposure Further, CD127ST2Thy12 lung ILCs, which showed a transcriptomic signature consistent with ILC1s, were expanded and activated by CDG combined with either Alternaria or IL33 CDGmediated suppression of type 2 inflammation occurred independent of IL18R, IL12, and STAT6 but required the stimulator of interferon genes STING and type 1 IFN signaling Thus, CDG potently suppresses ILC2driven lung inflammation and promotes ILC1 responses These results suggest potential therapeutic modulation of STING to suppress type 2 inflammation andor increase antiviral responses during respiratory infections,Thrombosis is a major concern in respiratory infections Our aim was to investigate the magnitude and duration of risk for arterial and venous thrombosis following discharge after respiratory infection Patients with respiratory infections were identified using the United States Nationwide Readmission Database from 2012 to 2014 Patients admitted with asthma or cellulitis served as comparators Readmissions for acute myocardial infarction MI and venous thromboembolism VTE were evaluated at 30 to 180xa0days The likelihood of a first thrombotic event after discharge was compared with a 30day period prior to hospitalization Among 5,271,068 patients discharged after a respiratory infection, 056 and 078 were readmitted within 30days with MI and VTE, respectively Relative to asthma and cellulitis, respiratory infection was associated with a greater age and sexadjusted hazard of 30day readmission for MI adjusted HR aHR 148 95 CI 142154 vs asthma aHR 136 95 CI 131141 vs cellulitis and VTE aHR 128 95 CI 124133 vs asthma aHR 126, 95 CI 122130 vs cellulitis Risks of MI and VTE attenuated over time In a crossovercohort analysis, the odds of MI OR 168 95 CI 162173 and VTE OR 330 95 319341 were higher in the 30xa0days following discharge after respiratory infection than during the 30day baseline period Hospitalization for respiratory infection was associated with increased risks of thrombosis that were highest in the first 30days after discharge and declined over time,The recent COVID19 pandemic has resulted in high fatality rates, especially for patients who suffer from underlying health issues One of the more serious symptoms exhibited from patients suffering from an acute COVID19 infection is breathing difficulties and shortness of breath, which is largely due to the excessive fluid cellular leakage and cytokine storm and mucoid debris that have filled lung alveoli, and reduced the surfactant tension resulting in heavy and stiff lungs In this paper, we propose the use of microbubbles filled with exosomes that can be released upon exposure to ultrasound signals as possible rescue therapy in deteriorating COVID19 patients Recent studies have shown that exosomes can be used to repair and treat lung damage for patients who have suffered from viral infection We have conducted simulations to show the efficacy of the ultrasound signals that will penetrate through layers of tissues reaching the alveoli that contain the microbubbles Our results have shown that ultrasound signals with low frequencies are required to oscillate and rupture the polymerbased microbubbles Our proposed system can be used for patients who require immediate rescue treatments for lung damage, as well as for recovered patients who may suffer from viral relapse infection, where the microbubbles will remain dormant for a temporary therapeutic window until they are exposed to the ultrasound signals,Objective Work engagement is considered a constructive and satisfying state of mind promoting wellbeing, whereas overcommitment contributes to illhealth We investigated if these psychosocial factors are related to asthma selfmanagement at the workplace ie, physical activity, trigger avoidance, acute symptom management, communication, asthma control, asthmaspecific quality of life, and the subjective prognosis of gainful employment among employees with asthma Methods Questionnaires were distributed in three pulmonary rehabilitation clinics 102017052018 in Germany Work engagement was measured by three items from the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire and overcommitment by six items from the effortreward imbalance questionnaire Asthma selfmanagement was mainly assessed by selfdeveloped items, asthma morbidity by the Asthma Control Test and the Marks Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, and the subjective prognosis of gainful employment by a validated threeitem scale After dichotomization of all variables we ran Poisson regression analyses to calculate multivariable prevalence ratios with 95 confidence intervals Results The sample comprised 221 individuals with asthma Low work engagement was related to physical inactivity Low work engagement and high overcommitment were associated with inadequate trigger avoidance and acute symptom management, reduced asthmaspecific quality of life, and a poor prognosis of gainful employment No relationships were observed with communication or asthma control Conclusions Our findings highlight the potential contribution of high levels of work engagement to adequate asthma selfmanagement, good quality of life, and a positive subjective prognosis of gainful employment among employees with asthma Overcommitment shows associations with those outcomes in the opposite direction, which suggests a detrimental role in asthma,Objective Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic, many studies have described the quantitative peripheral blood findings seen in COVID19 patients However, morphologic changes have been described by only a few studies We report morphologic and quantitative changes in peripheral blood of COVID19 patients Design We reviewed electronic medical records, complete blood counts, and peripheral blood smears of 20 patients who were COVID19 positive by reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction RTPCR,xa0from March 1, 2020, through May 31, 2020xa0The peripheral blood smears of all 20 patients were retrieved and morphological features of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets were reviewed and documented Appropriate pictures were taken Results Of the 20 patients reviewed, 13 were males and seven were females The average age of the patients was 651 years The most common quantitative hematologic abnormalities noted on complete blood count CBC were anemia followed by neutrophilia, neutrophilic left shift, and lymphopenia The most significant morphologic changes noted were neutrophils with clumped chromatin, multiple abnormal nuclear shapes, pseudoPelgerHuet deformity, and smudged neutrophils Lymphocytes showed abundant blue cytoplasm andor lymphoplasmacytoid morphology and monocytes were activated with abnormal shapes and vacuolizationxa0Platelets were adequate in number in the majority of patients and platelet clumping was the most significant finding noted The red blood cells were normocytic and normochromic with few nucleated red blood cells and coarse basophilic stippling Conclusion Our study identifies and describes significant morphologic changes in the peripheral blood cells of COVID19 patients An understanding of these morphologic changes in addition to established hematologic parameters can aid in the diagnosis of COVID19 and serial CBC and peripheral smear review may help with management decisions in COVID19 patients,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 causes a viral respiratory illness initially described in Wuhan, China, and was declared a pandemic by World Health Organization WHO in 2020, and the disease is named coronavirus disease COVID19xa0SARSCoV2 is known to cause fever, cough, fatigue, and acute respiratory distress syndrome As more patients become infected, extrapulmonary manifestations came to rise and hypercoagulability is one among those COVID19 could predispose patients to both venous and arterial thromboembolic events which are commonly treated with unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin LMWH The treatment of patients who develop heparininduced thrombocytopenia HIT while being treated with heparin or LMWH for COVIDinduced thromboembolic complications is challenging We describe a patient admitted to the hospital with COVID19 pneumonia, found to have a cerebrovascular event treated with unfractionated heparin She also received therapeutic LMWH for anticoagulation on day 1 of presentation due to atrial fibrillation She was diagnosed with HIT and was found to have a pulmonary embolism, aortic arch mural thrombus, and arterial thrombi in the lower extremities As more recent studies showed HIT antibodies in COVID19 patients who are naive for heparinbased products, COVID19 may be an independent risk factor for the development of HIT The role of COVID19 in the development of HIT is uncertain High vigilance is required to diagnose and initiate treatment for HIT early in the disease course as it can be lifethreatening,We used the eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm, an optimized gradient boosting machine learning library, and established a model to predict events in Philadelphia chromosomepositive acute lymphoblastic leukemia using a machine learningaided method A model was constructed using a training set 80 and prediction was tested using a test set 20 According to the feature importance score, BCRABL lineage, polymerase chain reaction value, age, and white blood cell count were identified as important features These features were also confirmed by the permutation feature importance for the prediction using the test set Both eventfree survival and overall survival were clearly stratified according to risk groups categorized using these features 80 and 100 in low risk two or less factors, 42 and 47 in intermediate risk three factors, and 0 and 10 in high risk four factors at 4u2009years Machine learningaided analysis was able to identify clinically useful prognostic factors using data from a relatively small number of patients,We present a single centre study describing the effect of awake prone position PP on oxygenation and clinical outcomes in spontaneously breathing patients with novel coronavirus disease COVID19 Between 1st March and 30th April 2020, forty eight of 138 patients managed outside of the critical care unit with facemask oxygen, high flow nasal oxygen HFNO or continuous positive airway pressure CPAP, underwent PP Prone position was associated with significant improvement in oxygenation, lower ICU admission, tracheal intubation, and shorter ICU length of stay Lack of response to PP may be an indicator of treatment failure, requiring early escalation,STelevation myocardial infarction treatment in the modern era has focused on minimizing time of ischemia by reducing doortoballoon time to limit infarct size and improve survival Although there have been significant improvements in minimizing time to coronary reperfusion, the incidence of heart failure following a myocardial infarction has remained high Preclinical studies have shown that unloading the left ventricle for 30xa0min prior to coronary reperfusion can reduce infarct size and promote myocardial recovery The DTUSTEMI randomized prospective trial will test the hypothesis that left ventricular unloading for at least 30xa0min prior to coronary reperfusion will improve infarct size and heart failurerelated events as compared with the current standard of care,The study of the muscles of the tongue forms part of a basic evaluation of upper airway function that includes swallowing, speaking and chewing It is important because the upper airway presents a region of collapse during sleep Through the action of the dilator muscles, mainly the genioglossus, such collapse can be prevented In this study, we present a simple tool that can be used to measure the strength of the tongue This tool may provide an easy way to measure tongue function and allow a simple evaluation of pathologies that affect the tone of the tongue We have carried out 20 tongue strength measurements using the Tongue Digital Spoon TDS in a healthy adult population, using the Iowa Oral Performance Instrument IOPI as the gold standard To validate the procedure, we performed replicate measurements on 20 individuals aged 2070 years We found a mean TDS measurement of 11599 gcm2 in young subjects, 9847 gcm2 in middleaged subjects and 8423 gcm2 in the elderly There was a significant difference in the measurements between young and elderly participants There was also a significant correlation between TDS and IOPI measurements Pearson correlation coefficient, r  069, P  0001 We found the TDS to be a useful tool in daily clinical practice for the measurement of the strength of the tongue in the healthy population It has potential application in oropharyngeal monitoring and rehabilitation,BACKGROUND The risk of complications, including death, is substantially increased in patients with pulmonary hypertension PH undergoing anaesthesia for surgical procedures, especially in those with pulmonary arterial hypertension PAH and chronic thromboembolic PH CTEPH Sedation also poses a risk to patients with PH Physiological changes including tachycardia, hypotension, fluid shifts, and an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance PH crisis can precipitate acute right ventricular decompensation and death METHODS A systematic literature review was performed of studies in patients with PH undergoing noncardiac and nonobstetric surgery The management of patients with PH requiring sedation for endoscopy was also reviewed Using a framework of relevant clinical questions, we review the available evidence guiding operative risk, risk assessment, preoperative optimisation, and perioperative management, and identifying areas for future research RESULTS Reported 30 day mortality after noncardiac and nonobstetric surgery ranges between 2 and 18 in patients with PH undergoing elective procedures, and increases to 1550 for emergency surgery, with complications and death usually relating to acute right ventricular failure Risk factors for mortality include procedurespecific and patientrelated factors, especially markers of PH severity eg pulmonary haemodynamics, poor exercise performance, and right ventricular dysfunction Most studies highlight the importance of individualised preoperative risk assessment and optimisation and advanced perioperative planning CONCLUSIONS With an increasing number of patients requiring surgery in specialist and nonspecialist PH centres, a systematic, evidencebased, multidisciplinary approach is required to minimise complications Adequate risk stratification and a tailoredindividualised perioperative plan is paramount,A 9yearold child, with a background of repaired pulmonary atresia and Ebsteins anomaly, presented with fever, night sweats and lethargy Blood cultures grew Granulicatella elegans, a nutritionally variant Streptococcus and known cause of infective endocarditis IE Echocardiogram revealed no clear vegetation, but increased stenosis of the right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduit The child was successfully managed with highdose benzylpenicillin, completing 2 weeks in the hospital, and was discharged to complete the final 4 weeks of therapy with ceftriaxone in the community, as per European Society of Cardiology guidance IE caused by any Granulicatella species is rare, with infection due to G elegans rarer still It is a Grampositive bacteria that presents a diagnostic challenge due to nonspecific symptoms at presentation and difficulty in growing the organism on culture medium We present a case of G elegans endocarditis in a young child, which illustrates the challenges in managing this condition and the importance of considering atypical organism endocarditis in children presenting with fever of unknown origin, in particular those with a background of congenital cardiac disease We review the literature on Granulicatella endocarditis, and briefly discuss the challenges of managing this condition in a child with an autism spectrum disorder and learning difficulties,BackgroundAtrial fibrillation AF is the most common cardiac arrhythmia Type 2 diabetes T2D is an independent risk factor for AF The cardioembolic stroke CS risk is increased when both conditions coexist Whether angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2 genetic variants predict increased risks AF and CS in Uygur patients with T2D remain elusiveMethodsA total of 547 Uygur subjects 272 controls and 275 T2D patients were recruited to the study from south Xinjiang Eight ACE2 variants were identified by MassARRAY systemResultsACE2 rs2074192 CC, adjusted RRu2009u2009255, 95 CI 135480, Pu2009u20090004, rs4240157

variants were related to larger left atrial endsystolic diameter LAD all P,STUDY OBJECTIVE We aim to determine incidence and type of adverse events adverse outcomes related to emergency care among emergency department ED patients discharged with recentonset atrial fibrillation, acute heart failure, and syncope METHODS This 5year prospective cohort study included highacuity adult patients discharged with the 3 sentinel diagnoses from 6 tertiary care Canadian EDs We screened all ED visits for eligibility and performed telephone interviews 14 days postdischarge to identify flagged outcomes death, hospital admission, return ED visit, health care provider visit, and new or worsening symptoms We created case summaries describing index ED visit and flagged outcomes, and trained emergency physicians reviewed case summaries to identify adverse events We reported adverse event incidence and rates with 95 confidence intervals and contributing factor themes RESULTS Among 4,741 subjects mean age 702 years 512 men, we observed 170 adverse events 36 per 100 patients 95 confidence interval 31 to 42 Patients discharged with acute heart failure were most likely to experience adverse events 53, followed by those with atrial fibrillation 20 and syncope 08 We noted variation in absolute adverse event rates across sites from 07 to 60 per 100 patients The most common adverse event types were management issues, diagnostic issues, and unsafe disposition decisions Frequent contributing factor themes included failure to recognize underlying causes and inappropriate management of dual diagnoses CONCLUSION Among adverse events after ED discharge for patients with these 3 sentinel cardiovascular diagnoses, we identified quality improvement opportunities such as strengthening dual diagnosis detection and evidencebased clinical practice guideline adherence,Purpose of ReviewLipoprotein apheresis is the most effective means of lipidlowering therapy However, its a semiinvasive, time consuming, and chronic therapy with variable adherence There are still no specific guideline recommendations for the management of patients on lipid apheresis The purpose of this review is to discuss the clinical indications and major drawbacks of lipid apheresis in the light of recent evidenceRecent FindingsLipoprotein apheresis should be initiated at early ages and performed frequently to receive the expected cardiovascular benefits However, in clinical practice, most patients experience ineffective apheresis and fail to reach lipid targets This realworld failure is due to several factors including late diagnosis, delayed referral, and improper frequency of procedures All these denote that awareness is still low among physicians Another important factor is the semiinvasive, time consuming nature of the apheresis, leading to high refusal and low adherence rates Moreover, apheresis decreases quality of life and increases the risk of depression Mental status is also deteriorated in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia on lipid apheresis New effective lipid lowering agents are underway with promising cardiovascular resultsSummaryTo overcome the drawbacks, a structured approach, including standardized protocols for lipoprotein apheresis with regular cardiovascular followup is warranted New effective lipid lowering agents with documented cardiovascular benefit, should be integrated into the treatment algorithms of patients on lipoprotein apheresis,The European Association of Cardiothoracic Anaesthesiology EACTA and the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesia SCA aimed to create joint recommendations for the perioperative management of patients with suspected or proven SARSCoV2 infection undergoing cardiac surgery or invasive cardiac procedures To produce appropriate recommendations, we combined the evidence from the literature review, reevaluating the clinical experience of routine cardiac surgery in similar cases during the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome MERSCoV outbreak and the current pandemic with suspected COVID19 patients, and the expert opinions through broad discussions within EACTA and SCA We took into consideration the balance between established procedures and the feasibility during the present outbreak We represent an agreement between the European and United States practices in managing patients during the COVID19 pandemic The recommendations take into consideration a broad spectrum of issues with a focus on preoperative testing, safety concerns, overall approaches to general and specific aspects of preparation for anesthesia, airway management, transesophageal echocardiography, perioperative ventilation, coagulation, and hemodynamic control and postoperative care As the COVID19 pandemic is spreading, it will continue to represent a challenge for the worldwide anesthesiology community To allow these recommendations to be updated as long as possible, we provided weblinks to international public and academic sources providing timely updated data Our document should be the basis of future Task Forces to develop a more comprehensive consensus considering new evidence uncovered during the COVID19 pandemic,BackgroundCovid19 pandemic is a major health calamity causing global crisis involving every aspect of the society CT chest has become an essential diagnostic investigation and as a prognostic tool for assessment for COVID19 bronchopneumonia This case report is about an incidental unexpected finding in a young female, who underwent CT chest screening with suspicion of COVID19 bronchopneumoniaCase presentationA 29yearold female came with the complaints of sore throat, myalgia, and fever for the past 3 days She was referred to our department for plain screening CT chest to rule out COVID 19 infection She was an active sports person since childhood CT chest revealed a large welldefined bullous cystic lesion of size 16 × 95 × 95 cm in the left lung lower lobe with partial sparing of its superior, anterior, and posterior basal segments Imaging diagnosis of large bullous cystic lesion with emphysematous changes was made No features of COVID 19 bronchopneumonia Thoracoscopyguided lobectomy was done, and tissue was sent to histopathological examination Final diagnosis was large type 1 congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation with mucinous metaplasia Our case is unique in the sense that large adult CCAM with mucinous metaplasia of the epithelium is a rare presentation Further it was diagnosed as a part of COVID 19 screeningConclusionCCAM presentation in adult is rare Asymptomatic CCAM lesion of this size diagnosed during COVID 19 chest CT screening was rarely described,Sickle cell disease SCD is one of the most common autosomal recessive disorders in the world Due to functional asplenia, a dysfunctional antibody response, antibiotic drug resistance and poor response to immunization, SCD patients have impaired immunity A leading cause of hospitalization and death in SCD patients is the acute chest syndrome ACS This complication is especially manifested upon infection of SCD patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae Spna facultative anaerobic Grampositive bacterium that causes lower respiratory tract infections Spn has developed increased rates of antibiotics resistance and is particularly virulent in SCD patients The primary defense against Spn is the generation of reactive oxygen species ROS during the oxidative burst of neutrophils and macrophages Paradoxically, Spn itself produces high levels of the ROS hydrogen peroxide H2O2 as a virulence strategy Apart from H2O2, Spn also secretes another virulence factor, ie, the poreforming exotoxin pneumolysin PLY, a potent mediator of lung injury in patients with pneumonia in general and particularly in those with SCD PLY is released early on in infection either by autolysis or bacterial lysis following the treatment with antibiotics and has a broad range of biological activities This review will discuss recent findings on the role of pneumococci in ACS pathogenesis and on strategies to counteract the devastating effects of its virulence factors on the lungs in SCD patients,,Treatment of patients with intermediate and highrisk pulmonary embolism PE is a controversial area Many therapeutic options exist, and deciding on appropriate treatment can be difficult In addition, multiple specialties are often involved in the care of PE patients To better organize the response to serious PE patients, several hospitals and academic centers throughout the world have created pulmonary embolism response teams PERTs The goal of a PERT is to have a single multidisciplinary team of experts in thromboembolic disease, who can respond rapidly to patients with acute PE, and offer consultation and implementation of the full spectrum of therapeutic options PERT teams were modeled after rapid response teams and are meant to generate a prompt, patientspecific plan for patients with PE without having to consult multiple individual specialists Data are emerging demonstrating the value of PERTs in reducing hospital length of stay and, possibly, patient outcomes,Background Racial inequities in mortality and readmission for heart failure HF are well documented Inequitable access to specialized cardiology care during admissions may contribute to inequity, and the drivers of this inequity are poorly understood Methodology This prospective observational study explored proposed drivers of racial inequities in cardiology admissions among Black, Latinx, and white adults presenting to the emergency department ED with symptoms of HF Surveys of ED providers examined perceptions of patient selfadvocacy, outreach to other clinicians eg, outpatient cardiologist, diagnostic uncertainty, and other active comorbid conditions Service census, bed availability, prior admission service, and other structural factors were explored through the electronic medical record Results Complete data were available for 61135 patients admitted with HF during the study period, which halted early due to coronavirus disease 2019 No significant differences emerged in admission to cardiology versus medicine based on age, sex, insurance status, education level, or perceived raceethnicity White patients were perceived as advocating for admission to cardiology more frequently 189 vs 56 and more strenuously than Black patients p  0097 ED clinicians more often reported having spoken with the patients outpatient cardiologist for whites than for Black or Latinx patients 243 vs 167, p  0069 Conclusions Theorized drivers of racial inequities in admission service did not reach statistical significance, possibly due to underpowering, the Hawthorne effect, or clinician behavior change based on knowledge of previously identified inequities The observed trend towards racialxa0differences in coordination of care between ED and outpatient providers, as well as in either actual or perceived selfadvocacy by patients, may bexa0asyet undemonstrated components of structural racism driving HF care inequities,Introduction Among the multiple complex pathophysiological mechanisms underlying COVID19 pneumonia, immunothrombosis has been shown to play a key role One of the most dangerous consequences of the prothrombotic imbalance is the increased incidence of micro and macrothrombotic phenomena, especially deep vein thrombosis DVT and pulmonary embolism PE Methods We investigated the correlation between radiological and clinicalbiochemical characteristics of a cohort of hospitalized COVID19 patients Results PE was confirmed in 1461 23 patients, five 357 had DVT The radiographic findings, quantified by Qanadli score, correlated with the clinical score and biochemical markers The ratio between the right and left ventricle diameter measured at CT scan correlated with the length of hospital stay Conclusion In our cohort radiological parameters showed a significant correlation with clinical prognostic indices and scores, thus suggesting that a multidisciplinary approach is advisable in the evaluation of PE in COVID19 patients,Immune thrombocytopenia ITP is an autoimmune disorder defined by a significantly reduced number of platelets in blood circulation Due to low levels of platelets, ITP is associated with frequent bruising and bleeding Current evidence suggests that low platelet counts in ITP are the result of multiple factors, including impaired thrombopoiesis and variations in immune response leading to platelet destruction during pathological conditions Patient outcomes as well as clinic presentation of the disease have largely been shown to be casespecific, hinting towards ITP rather being a group of clinical conditions sharing common symptoms The most frequent characteristics include dysfunction in primary haemostasis and loss of immune tolerance towards platelet as well as megakaryocyte antigens This heterogeneity in patient population and characteristics make it challenging for the clinicians to choose appropriate therapeutic regimen Therefore, it is vital to understand the pathomechanisms behind the disease and to consider various factors including patient age, platelet count levels, comorbidities and patient preferences before initiating therapy This review summarizes recent developments in the pathophysiology of ITP and provides a comprehensive overview of current therapeutic strategies as well as potential future drugs for the management of ITP,COVID‐19 has a broad clinical spectrum We investigated the role of serum markers measured on admission on severity as assessed at discharge and investigated those which relate to the effect of BMI on severity Clinical and laboratory data from 610 COVID‐19 cases hospitalized in the province of Zheijang, China were investigated as risk factors for severe COVID‐19 assessed by respiratory distress compared to mild or common forms using logistic regression methods Biochemical markers were correlated with severity using spearman correlations, and a ROC analysis was used to determine the individual contribution of each of the biochemical markers on severity We carried out formal mediation analyses to investigate the extent of the effect of body mass index BMI on COVID‐19 severity mediated by hypertension, glycemia, Lactose Dehydrogenase LDH at the time of hospitalization and C‐Reactive Protein levels CRP, in units of standard deviations The individual markers measured on admission contributing most strongly to prediction of COVID‐19 severity as assessed at discharge were LDH, CRP and glucose The proportion of the effect of BMI on severity of COVID‐19 mediated by CRP, glycemia or hypertension, we find that glucose mediated 79 p  0001, LDH mediated 78 p  0001, hypertension mediated 66 p  0001 however, only 44 p  005 was mediated by systemic inflammation CRP Our data indicate that a larger proportion of the effect of BMI on severity of COVID‐19 is mediated by glycemia and LDH levels whereas less than half of it is mediated by systemic inflammation COVID‐19 has a broad clinical spectrum We investigated the role of serum markers measured on admission on severity as assessed at discharge and investigated those which relate to the effect of BMI on severity,OBJECTIVE To describe a case of Burkitt lymphoma BL in a child manifesting with acute airway obstruction To review available literature on the clinical features and characteristic presentation of this disease METHODS Case report with literature review RESULTS We present the case of an 8yearold boy with nasopharyngeal BL manifesting initially as sore throat, nasal congestion, and snoring that progressed to dyspnea and, ultimately, acute airway obstruction requiring emergent tracheostomy The child was treated with intensive chemotherapy and achieved complete response CONCLUSION This case highlights the importance of maintaining high clinical suspicion when evaluating common otolaryngologic symptoms and emphasizes the potential for Burkitt lymphoma to cause rapid patient deterioration,,BACKGROUND The likelihood of children with asthma experiencing an exacerbation at school is significantly high when considering that they spend a substantial part of their day at school This study, therefore, aimed to systematically review the literature to determine current asthma management practices by primary school teaching staff and any existing supporting legislationpoliciesguidelines METHODS Search terms were adapted to search literature across databases CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Education DatabaseProQuest, IPA, MEDLINE, SCI Primary research studies, reviews, systematic reviews, and metaanalyses in English about primary school teaching staff dated between 2007 and 2017 were included Primary outcomes comprised teaching staff practices regarding asthma management and supporting guidelines, policies, or legislation RESULTS Analysis of the 13 papers eligible for full review identified that teachers were unable to deal with an asthma exacerbation they lacked knowledge regarding exerciseinduced asthma and that there was poor communication between schools and parents of children with asthma The only documented relevant asthma legislation found pertained to New York schools CONCLUSIONS Limited evidence regarding asthma management practices and inadequate asthma management knowledge amongst teaching staff highlight the need for supporting teaching staff with asthma policies and guidelines to minimize risks associated with inappropriate asthma management,Despite the availability of effective medication, blood pressure control rates are low, particularly in low and middleincome countries Adherence to medication and followup visits are important factors in blood pressure control This study assessed the effectiveness of reminder telephone calls on followup visits and blood pressure control among hypertensive patients as part of the Mumbai Hypertension Project This project was initiated by PATH with the support from Resolve to Save Lives from January 2019 to February 2020 The study included hypertensive patients attending 164 private practices in Mumbai, India practitioners screened all adults visiting their clinic during the project period Among 13xa0184 hypertensive patients registered, the mean age was 53xa0years SDxa0xa01238 and 52 were female Among the 11xa0544 patients that provided phone numbers and gave consent for followup calls, 9528 responded to phone calls at least once and 5250 patients followed up at least once Of the 5250 patients, 82 visited the clinic for followup visit within one month after receiving the phone call The blood pressure control rate among those who answered phone calls and who did not answer phone calls increased from 236 to 488 P,,Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19, caused by SARSCoV2, has induced a worldwide pandemic since early 2020 COVID19 causes pulmonary inflammation secondary to pulmonary fibrosis PF however, there are still no effective treatments for PF The present study aimed to explore the inhibitory effect of dihydroartemisinin DHA on pulmonary inflammation and PF, and its molecular mechanism Morphological changes and collagen deposition were analyzed using hematoxylin‑eosin staining, Masson staining, and the hydroxyproline content DHA attenuated early alveolar inflammation and later PF in a bleomycininduced rat PF model, and inhibited the expression of interleukin IL ‑1β, IL 6, tumor necrosis factor α TNFα, and chemokine CC Motif Ligand 3 CCL3 in model rat serum Further molecular analysis revealed that both pulmonary inflammation and PF were associated with increased transforming growth factorβ1 TGFβ1, Janus activated kinase 2 JAK2, and signal transducer and activator 3STAT3 expression in the lung tissues of model rats DHA reduces the inflammatory response and PF in the lungs by suppressing TGFβ1, JAK2, phosphorylated pJAK2, STAT3, and pSTAT3 degradation Thus, DHA exerts therapeutic effects against bleomycininduced pulmonary inflammation and PF by inhibiting JAK2STAT3 activation Thus, DHA inhibits alveolar inflammation, and attenuates lung injury and fibrosis, possibly representing a therapeutic candidate to treat COVID19,,BackgroundBronchopulmonary foregut malformations are rare congenital malformations It is extremely rare to have malformations that occur simultaneously There is literature to show that extralobar sequestration is associated with other congenital anomalies, most commonly diaphragmatic hernias, and also with other bronchopulmonary foregut malformations eg, extralobar sequestration and congenital pulmonary airway malformations However, very few case reports were found that reported extralobar sequestration and foregut duplication cysts and only one report of a rightsided complex foregut malformation with pulmonary sequestrationCase presentationWe present a case of a 3monthold male infant with a prenatal diagnosis of a cystic lung lesion who, after developing symptoms of respiratory distress, was found to have concurrent rightsided extralobar pulmonary sequestration and a mediastinal bronchogenic cystConclusionsThe concurrent occurrence of these malformations in one patient could help support the theory that these malformations result from an early error in development during the time when both the lung buds and foregut are developing simultaneously,Background This paper aims to compare dosimetric parameters of the organs at risk OARs among three different radiotherapy RT modalities in left breast cancer patients after breastconserving surgery BCSxa0Methods Eleven patients with left breast cancer after BCS were enrolled and underwent CT simulation in the free breathing FB and deep inspirationxa0breathxa0hold DIBH position Threedimensional radiotherapy 3DCRT and volumetric modulated arc therapy VMAT plans were generated for each patient in the DIBH position A 3DCRT plan was also created in the FB position Dosevolume histogram DVH was used to analyze each evaluation index of OARs The principal outcome was heart dose, left anterior descending coronary artery LADCA dose and left lung doseResults For the 3DCRT plans, significant dose reductions were demonstrated in all evaluation parameters to heart, LADCA and left lung dose in the DIBH position compared with the FB position p  005 In DIBH position, significant dose reductions were founded in heart and LADCA in VMAT plan compared to 3DCRT plan p  005 There were no significant differences between 3DCRT and VMAT plan for the left lung dose in DIBH positionConclusion DIBH and VMAT could reduce dosimetric parameters of the OARs in left breast cancer patients after BCS RT plans for left breast cancer after BCS can be optimized by DIBH and VMAT techniques to minimize radiationinduced toxicity,Background There is a great need to make a rapid differential clinical diagnosis of COVID19 among respiratory disease patients and determining the prevalence rate of these diseases among the COVID19 population Method Approximately 522 patients with allergic rhinitis, asthma, COPD, and COVID19 were analyzed for demographic and clinical features Radiological features were analyzed only for COVID19 patients Results COPD and asthma were more common among COVID19 patients than allergic rhinitis All chest CT scans of COVID19 patients showed bilateral groundglass opacity Fever, dry cough, diarrhea, loss of sense of smell and taste, shortness of breath, and blue lips were significantly higher in all COVID19 patients compared to COPD, asthma, and allergic rhinitis patients Conclusion The presence of clinical symptoms such as fever, dry cough, diarrhea, loss of sense of smell and taste, shortness of breath, and blue lips in COVID19 patients, can be used for differential diagnosis between COVID19 patients and other respiratory diseases Then, the diagnosis can be confirmed by chest CT scan for COVID19 patients without the need for a nasopharyngeal swab or PCR test, especially in epidemic countries Allergic rhinitis patients are the least exposed to COVID19 infection among other respiratory disease patients,Mortality due to Covid19 is highly associated with advanced age, owing in large part to severe lower respiratory tract infection SARSCoV2 utilizes the host ACE2 receptor for infection Whether ACE2 abundance in the lung contributes to ageassociated vulnerability is currently unknown We set out to characterize the RNA and protein expression profiles of ACE2 in aging human lung in the context of phenotypic parameters likely to affect lung physiology Examining publicly available RNA sequencing data, we discovered that mechanical ventilation is a critical variable affecting lung ACE2 levels Therefore, we investigated ACE2 protein abundance in patients either requiring mechanical ventilation or spontaneously breathing ACE2 distribution and expression were determined in archival lung samples by immunohistochemistry IHC Tissues were selected from the specimen inventory at a large teaching hospital collected between 20102020 Twelve samples were chosen from patients receiving mechanical ventilation for acute hypoxic respiratory failure AHRF Twenty samples were selected from patients not requiring ventilation We compared samples across age, ranging from 4083 years old in the ventilated cohort and 1480 years old in the nonventilated cohort Within the alveolated parenchyma, ACE2 expression is predominantly observed in type II pneumocytes or alveolar type II  AT2 cells and alveolar macrophages All 12 samples from our ventilated cohort showed histologic features of diffuse alveolar damage including reactive, proliferating AT2 cells In these cases, ACE2 was strongly upregulated with age when normalized to lung area p  0004 or cellularity p  0003, associated with prominent expression in AT2 cells In nonventilated individuals, AT2 cell reactive changes were not observed and ACE2 expression did not change with age when normalized to lung area p  0231 or cellularity p  0349 In summary, ACE2 expression increases with age in the setting of alveolar damage observed in patients on mechanical ventilation, providing a potential mechanism for higher Covid19 mortality in the elderly,,Purpose To investigate the role of lowdose chest computed tomography CT imaging in the triage of patients suspected of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 in an emergency setting Materials and Methods Data from 610 patients admitted to our emergency unit from March 20, 2020, until April 11, 2020, with suspicion of COVID19 were collected Diagnostic values of lowdose chest CT for COVID19 were calculated using consecutive reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction RTPCR tests and bronchoalveolar lavage BAL as reference Comparative analysis of the 199 COVID19 positive versus 411 COVID19 negative patients was done with identification of risk factors and predictors of worse outcome Results Sensitivity and specificity of lowdose CT for the diagnosis of COVID19 respectively ranged from 75 150199 to 88 175199 and 94 386411 to 99 386389, depending on the inclusion of inconclusive results On multivariate analysis, a higher body mass index BMI, fever, and dyspnea on admission were risk factors for COVID19 all pvalues  005 The mortality rate was 126 25199 Higher age and high levels of Creactive protein CRP and Ddimers were predictors of worse outcome all pvalues  005 Conclusion Lowdose chest CT has a high specificity and a moderate to high sensitivity in symptomatic patients with suspicion of COVID19 and could be used as an effective tool in setting of triage in highprevalence areas,Sickle cell anemia SCA is a chronic illness that requires frequent health care visits for preventative management Adherence to national guidelines such as the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute NHLBI Expert Panel Report on the EvidenceBased Management of Sickle Cell Disease can be challenging to both the clinician and the patient Utilizing effective communication strategies with patients and their families can improve clinicianpatient relationships, as well as adherence to national guidelines Aims of this overview are to review challenges faced in outpatient subspecialty medicine and describe evidencebased techniques for more effective communication for patients with sickle cell anemia,,Despite the introduction of antiretroviral therapy, chronic HIV infection is associated with an increased incidence of other comorbidities such as COPD Based on the knowledge that binding of HIV to human airway basal stemprogenitor cells BC induces a destructive phenotype by increased MMP9 expression through MAPK signaling pathways, we hypothesized that HIV induces the BC to express inflammatory mediators that contribute to the pathogenesis of emphysema Our data demonstrate that airway BC isolated from HAARTtreated HIV nonsmokers spontaneously release inflammatory mediators IL8, IL1β, ICAM1 and GMCSF Similarly, exposure of normal BC to HIV in vitro upregulates expression of the same inflammatory mediators These HIVBC derived mediators induce migration of alveolar macrophages AM and neutrophils and stimulate AM proliferation This HIVinduced inflammatory phenotype likely contributes to lung inflammation in HIV individuals and provides explanation for the increased incidence of COPD in HIV individuals,Although synovitis is the pathological hallmark of rheumatoid arthritis RA, many extraarticular manifestations EMs and comorbidities likely occur due to the complex, chronic, inflammatory, and autoimmune features of RA Cardiovascular CV disease is the most common cause of death in patients with RA Compared to the general population, patients with RA have twice the risk of myocardial infarction and up to 50 increased CV mortality risk Severe and prolonged disease activity, genetics, and inflammation eg CRP, ACPA, cytokines, matrixdegrading enzymes play important roles in CV disease and atheroscleroticdamage The second major cause of death in patients with RA is respiratory disease, which occurs in 3040 of patients RA may affect the lung interstitium, airways, and pleurae, while pulmonary vascular involvement is less frequent Central and peripheral nervous system involvement is usually due to small vessel vasculitis, joint damage, or drug toxicity There is also evidence that microvascular cerebral damage caused by systemic inflammation is associated with the development of Alzheimers disease and vascular dementia Some observational studies have hinted how Disease Modified AntiRheumatic Drugs and biologics could reduce the incidence of dementia Primary gastrointestinal and renal involvements are rare and often relate to drug therapy To minimize morbidity and mortality, physicians must manage RA disease activity treattotarget and monitor risk factors and concomitant conditions eg smoking cessation weight regulation monitoring blood pressure, lipids, thyroid hormone, folic acid and homocysteine screening for depression, anxiety, atlantoaxial instability, and atherosclerosis This article aims to provide an overview of the most prevalent and important EMs and comorbidities associated with RA,On January 19, 2021, a new regulation on the mask requirement was issued in an initiative by the federal and state governments This regulation obliges citizens to wear medical masks on public transport and in shops In its statement, the German Society for Pneumology and Respiratory Medicine DGP describes the technical background of the various medical masks and explains their functionality using the associated standards The DGP comes to the conclusion that FFP masks of the EN 149 standard were designed for the selfprotection of the wearer and ensure this if the mask is worn properly and closes tightly to the face Incorrect use must be avoided at all costs Surgical masks in accordance with the EN 14683 standard were designed to protect against bacteriacarrying aerosols and, due to their design, have a rather low selfprotection component Community masks are not yet subject to any official standard Community masks with electrostatic properties and high filtration performance could represent a reusable alternative in the future Depending on the severity of their illness, patients with heart andor lung diseases require a stress test with a mask to minimize medical risks,Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, is a global pandemic It has resulted in considerable morbidity and mortality around the world The respiratory system is the main system invaded by the virus involved in COVID19 In addition to typical respiratory manifestations, a certain proportion of severe COVID19 cases present with evidence of myocardial injury, which is associated with excessive mortality With availability of an increasing amount of imaging data, right ventricular RV damage is prevalent in patients with COVID19 and myocardial injury, while left ventricular damage is relatively rare and lacks specificity The mechanisms of RV damage may be due to increased RV afterload and decreased RV contractility caused by various factors, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary thrombosis, direct viral injury, hypoxia, inflammatory response and autoimmune injury RV dysfunction usually indicates a poor clinical outcome in patients with COVID19 Timely and effective treatment is of vital importance to save patients lives as well as improve prognosis By use of echocardiography or cardiovascular magnetic resonance, doctors can find RV dilatation and dysfunction early By illustrating the phenomenon of RV damage and its potential pathophysiological mechanisms, we will guide doctors to give timely medical treatments eg, anticoagulants, diuretics, cardiotonic, and deviceassisted therapy eg, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation when necessary for these patients In the paper, we examined the latest relevant studies to investigate the imaging features, potential mechanisms, and treatments of myocardial damage caused by COVID19 RV damage may be an association between myocardial damage and lung injury in COVID19 Early assessment of RV geometry and function will be helpful in aetiological determination and adjustment of treatment options,BACKGROUND Myocardial injury has been found using magnetic resonance imaging in recovered coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 patients unselected or with ongoing cardiac symptoms PURPOSE To evaluate for the presence of myocardial involvement in recovered COVID19 patients without cardiovascular symptoms and abnormal serologic markers during hospitalization STUDY TYPE Prospective POPULATION Twentyone recovered COVID19 patients and 20 healthy controls HC FIELD STRENGTHSEQUENCE 30u2009T, cine, T2weighted imaging, T1 mapping, and T2 mapping ASSESSMENT Cardiac ventricular function includes enddiastolic volume, endsystolic volume, stroke volume, cardiac output, left ventricle LV mass, and ejection fraction EF of LV and right ventricle RV, and segmental myocardial T1 and T2 values were measured STATISTICAL TESTS Students ttest, univariate general linear model test, and chisquare test were used for analyses between two groups Ordinary oneway analyses of variance or KruskalWallis H test were used for analyses between three groups, followed by posthoc analyses RESULTS Fifteen 7143 COVID19 patients had abnormal magnetic resonance findings, including raised myocardial native T1 5, 2381 and T2 values 10, 4762, decreased LVEF 1, 476, and RVEF 2, 952 The segmental myocardial T2 value of COVID19 patients 4920 461, 546 msec was significantly higher than HC 483 452, 517 msec P,,The novel coronavirus disease 2019 Covid19 pandemic has affected millions of patients in almost all countries with over one million cases recorded in Africa where it is a major health challenge Covid19 is known to have significant implications for those with preexisting cardiovascular disease CVD and their cardiologists Patients with preexisting CVD are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality from Covid19 due to associated direct and indirect life threatening cardiovascular CV complications Mitigating the risk of such Covid19 deaths in resource poor communities requires the institution of preventive measures at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels of preventive phenomenon with emphasis at the first two levels General preventive measures, screening and monitoring of CVD patients for complications and modification of drug treatment and other treatment methods will need to be implemented Health policy makers and manager should provide required training and retraining of CV health care workers managing Covid19 patients with CVD, provision of health education, personal protective equipment PPE, and diagnostic kits,BACKGROUND The COVID19 pandemic has resulted in more than 72 million cases and 16 million deaths Endstage lung disease from COVID19 is a new and growing entity that may benefit from lung transplant, however there is limited data on the patient selection, perioperative management and expected outcomes of transplantation for this indication METHODS A systematic review of the literature was performed with searches of MEDLINE and Web of Science databases as well the gray literature All manuscripts, editorials, commentaries and gray literature reports of lung transplantation for COVID related respiratory failure were included A case from the University of Virginia is described and included in the review RESULTS A total of 27 studies were included 11 manuscripts, 5 commentaries, and 11 gray literature reports The total number of transplantations for COVID related lung disease was 21 The mean age was 55  12 years, 16 76 were male, and the acuity was high with 85 on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation preoperatively There was a 95 early survival rate, with one additional late death There is growing histopathologic evidence for permanent structural damage with no replicating virus at the time of transplantation CONCLUSIONS Bilateral lung transplantation is an effective treatment option with reasonable shortterm outcomes for patients suffering from endstage lung failure secondary to COVID19 However, specific considerations in this new population require a multidisciplinary approach As we move into the second wave of the COVID19 global pandemic, lung transplantation will likely have a growing role in management of these complex patients,BACKGROUND Although the imaging features of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 are starting to be well determined, what actually occurs within the bronchi is poorly known Here, we report the processes and findings of bronchoscopy in a patient with COVID19 accompanied by respiratory failure CASE SUMMARY A 65yearold male patient was admitted to the Hainan General Hospital on February 3, 2020 for fever and shortness of breath for 13 d that worsened for the last 2 d The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 nucleic acid test was positive Routine blood examination on February 28 showed a white blood cell count of 1102 × 109L, 869 of neutrophils, 64 of lymphocytes, absolute lymphocyte count of 071 × 109L, procalcitonin of 2260 ngmL, and Creactive protein of 14261 mgL Oxygen saturation was 46 at baseline and turned to 94 after ventilation The patient underwent video bronchoscopy The tracheal cartilage ring was clear, and no deformity was found in the lumen The trachea and bilateral bronchi were patent, while the mucosa was with slight hyperemia no neoplasm or ulcer was found Moderate amounts of white gelatinous secretions were found in the dorsal segment of the left inferior lobe, and the bronchial lumen was patent after sputum aspiration The right inferior lobe was found with hyperemia and mucosal erosion, with white gelatinous secretion attachment The patients condition did not improve after the application of therapeutic bronchoscopy CONCLUSION For patients with COVID19 and respiratory failure, bronchoscopy can be performed under mechanical ventilation to clarify the airway conditions Protection should be worn during the process Considering the risk of infection, it is not necessary to perform bronchoscopy in the mild to moderate COVID19 patients,PURPOSE OF REVIEW Hospitalizations for COVID19 dramatically increase with age This is likely because of increases in fragility across biological repair systems and a weakened immune system, including loss of the cardiorenal protective arm of the reninangiotensin system RAS, composed of angiotensinconverting enzyme2 ACE2angiotensin17 Ang17 and its actions through the Mas receptor The purpose of this review is to explore how cardiac ACE2 changes with age, cardiac diseases, comorbid conditions and pharmaceutical regimens in order to shed light on a potential hormonal unbalance facilitating SARsCoV2 vulnerabilities in older adults RECENT FINDINGS Increased ACE2 gene expression has been reported in human hearts with myocardial infarction, cardiac remodeling and heart failure We also found ACE2 mRNA in atrial appendage tissue from cardiac surgical patients to be positively associated with age, elevated by certain comorbid conditions eg COPD and previous stroke and increased in conjunction with patients chronic use of antithrombotic agents and thiazide diuretics but not drugs that block the reninangiotensin system SUMMARY Cardiac ACE2 may have bifunctional roles in COVID19 as ACE2 not only mediates cellular susceptibility to SARSCoV2 infection but also protects the heart via the ACE2Ang17 pathway Linking tissue ACE2 from cardiac surgery patients to their comorbid conditions and medical regimens provides a unique latform to address the influence that altered expression of the ACE2Ang17Mas receptor axis might have on SARsCoV2 vulnerability in older adults,BACKGROUND COVID19 Convalescent Plasma CCP is a promising treatment for COVID19 Blood collectors have rapidly scaled up collection and distribution programs METHODS We developed a detailed simulation model of CCP donor recruitment, collection, production, and distribution processes We ran our model using varying epidemic trajectories from 11 US states and with key input parameters drawn from wide ranges of plausible values to identify key drivers of ability to scale collections capacity and meet demand for CCP RESULTS Utilization of available CCP collections capacity followed increases in COVID19 hospital discharges with a lag Utilization never exceeded 75 of available capacity in most simulations Demand was met for most of the simulation period in most simulations, but a substantial portion of demand went unmet during early, sharp increases in hospitalizations For epidemic trajectories that included multiple epidemic peaks, second wave demand could generally be met due to stockpiles established during the decline from an earlier peak Apheresis machine capacity number of machines and probability that COVID19 recovered individuals are willing to donate were the most important supplyside drivers of ability to meet demand Recruitment capacity was important in states with early peaks CONCLUSIONS Epidemic trajectory was the most important determinant of ability to meet demand for CCP, although our simulations revealed several contributing operational drivers of CCP program success,An amendment to this paper has been published and can be accessed via the original article,Many patients who suffer from pulmonary diseases cannot inflate their lungs normally as they need Mechanical Ventilation MV to assist them The stress associated with MV can damage delicate epithelium in small airways and alveoli which can cause complications in many cases resulting in Ventilation Induced Lungs injuries VILI especially in patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ARDS Therefore, efforts have been used to developed safe modes for its use In our work, we propose a different approach to decrease injuries of Epithelial Cells EpCs upon MV We alter EpCs cytoskeletal structure to increase their survival rate during airway reopening conditions associated with MV We tested two antiinflammatory drugs Dexamethasone DEX and TransDehydroandrosterone DHEA to alter the cytoskeleton Cultured rat L2 alveolar EpCs were exposed to airway reopening conditions using a parallel plate perfusion chamber Cells were exposed to a single bubble propagation to simulate stresses associated with mechanical ventilation in both control and study groups Cellular injury and cytoskeleton reorganization were assessed via fluorescent microscopy while cell topography was studied via Atomic Force Microscopy AFM Our results indicate that cells in cultured media, DEX, or DHEA solutions did not lead to cell death static cultures Bubble flows caused significant cell injury Preexposure with DEX or DHEA decreased cell death significantly The AFM verified cells mechanics alteration due to actin fibers depolymerization These results suggest potential beneficial effects of DEX and DHEA for ARRDS treatment for COVID19 patients They are also critical for VILI and applicable to future clinical studies,BACKGROUND Lockdown was imposed for children for 75 days in Turkey to limit the spread of COVID19 During this period children have to stay indoors, which might probably increase their exposures to indoor allergens and pollutants Besides, reduced exposures to respiratory tract infections and outdoor pollutants might be favorable outcomes of this lockdown period We evaluated the effects of the lockdown on house dust mite HDM sensitized children with respiratory allergies METHODS Threemonth clinical and medication data of 165 mildmoderate asthmatic children with or without allergic rhinitis AR, who were grouped according to their HDM sensitization status were retrieved from patient records Demographics, asthma control tests, nasal visual analog scores and outdoor airquality monitoring data were used for assessments in comparisons to the same period in the previous year RESULTS Eightyfour patients had asthma and 81 patients had asthma with AR Sensitization to HDM was present in 618 of the children Patients experienced reduced numbers of upperrespiratory tract infections p0008 and reduced asthma exacerbations p0001 compared to the same period in the previous year Asthma control tests were significantly improved p0001 and cumulative inhaled corticosteroid usages were significantly reduced p0001 Noteworthily, nasal symptoms were significantly worsened in HDMsensitized asthmatics with AR p0001 CONCLUSIONS This study highlighted that reduction in respiratory tract infections and outdoor pollution may play roles in asthma control and prevent exacerbations despite continuous indoor allergen exposure Besides, worsening of nasal symptoms in HDMsensitized asthmatics with AR implies importance of indoor avoidance measures for AR control,The Covid19 pandemia has many other undesirable consequences apart of virus infection Less people is hospitalized due to acute coronary syndrome and the delay to seek medical attention has increased Patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction arrive at the hospital too late to be timely treated and we have recently seen mechanical complications that were more frequent in the past decades before the use of reperfusion strategies In this report we describe the presentation, evolution and detailed imaging evaluation of two patients with unusual presentations of cardiac rupture left ventricular pseudoaneurysm and left ventricular intramyocardial dissecting hematoma,Coronavirus disease COVID2019 causes respiratory and systemic disease, has led to a sudden epidemic that affects people of all ages The presence of cardiovascular comorbidities is associated with a higher risk of death Therefore, patients with congenital heart disease represent a high risk population When respiratory failure develops and mechanical ventilation is not sufficient due to Covid 19, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ECMO may use as a form of rescue therapy In this article, we present a newborn who required ECMO support for acute respiratory failure in the early postoperative period due to coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 after the aortic arch repair and ventricular septal defect closure operation To the best of our knowledge, this patient was the first neonate case of SARSCoV2 infection after congenital heart surgery and was the youngest patient to receive ECMO support,Persistent postCOVID syndrome, also referred to as long COVID, is a pathologic entity, which involves persistent physical, medical, and cognitive sequelae following COVID19, including persistent immunosuppression as well as pulmonary, cardiac, and vascular fibrosis Pathologic fibrosis of organs and vasculature leads to increased mortality and severely worsened quality of life Inhibiting transforming growth factor beta TGFβ, an immuno and a fibrosis modulator, may attenuate these postCOVID sequelae Current preclinical and clinical efforts are centered on the mechanisms and manifestations of COVID19 and its presymptomatic and prodromal periods by comparison, the postdrome, which occurs in the aftermath of COVID19, which we refer to as persistent postCOVIDsyndrome, has received little attention Potential longterm effects from postCOVID syndrome will assume increasing importance as a surge of treated patients are discharged from the hospital, placing a burden on healthcare systems, patients families, and society in general to care for these medically devastated COVID19 survivors This review explores underlying mechanisms and possible manifestations of persistent postCOVID syndrome, and presents a framework of strategies for the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected or confirmed persistent postCOVID syndrome,BACKGROUND The first outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 occurred in March 2020 in Europe, which is normally the peak incidence period of human metapneumovirus HMPV infections, implying cocirculation and potentially causing competition between them METHODS We investigated differences in clinical characteristics and outcomes of HMPV infections in hospitalized patients before January 201628 February, 2020 and HMPV and COVID19 during part of the COVID19 pandemic 28 February, 20201 April, 2020 RESULTS A total of 239 HMPV patients and 303 COVID19 patients were included Incidence of HMPV peaked in March Despite a 324 increase in HMPV testing during the COVID19 outbreak, incidence of HMPV remained stable Clinical characteristics showed 25 11 ICU admissions and 14 6 deaths History of myocardial infarction, higher age and lower BMI were independently associated with increased 30day mortality Clinical characteristics of HMPVinfected patients did not differ between the nonCOVID19 period and the examined COVID19 period except for length of hospital stay 7 vs 5u2009days HMPV infection and COVID19 shared many clinical features but HMPV was associated with female gender, elderly patients and chronic conditions COPD and chronic heart failure Clinical outcomes did not differ between the viruses during the COVID19 period CONCLUSIONS The clinical impact of HMPV infection did not change during the COVID19 outbreak in terms of incidence andor disease severity hence, HMPV and SARSCoV2 are probably cocirculating independently Despite the current clinical focus on the COVID19 pandemic, clinicians should keep in mind that HMPVinfection may mimic COVID19 and is also associated with serious adverse outcomes,,BACKGROUND The interplay between COVID19 pandemic and asthma in children is still unclear We evaluated the impact of COVID19 pandemic on childhood asthma outcomes METHODS The PeARL multinational cohort included 1,054 children with asthma and 505 nonasthmatic children aged between 418 years from 25 pediatric departments, from 15 countries globally We compared the frequency of acute respiratory and febrile presentations during the first wave of the COVID19 pandemic between groups and with data available from the previous year In children with asthma, we also compared current and historical disease control RESULTS During the pandemic, children with asthma experienced fewer upper respiratory tract infections, episodes of pyrexia, emergency visits, hospital admissions, asthma attacks and hospitalizations due to asthma, in comparison to the preceding year Sixtysix percent of asthmatic children had improved asthma control while in 33 the improvement exceeded the minimal clinically important difference Prebronchodilatation FEV1 and peak expiratory flow rate were improved during the pandemic When compared to nonasthmatic controls, children with asthma were not at increased risk of LRTIs, episodes of pyrexia, emergency visits or hospitalizations during the pandemic However, an increased risk of URTIs emerged CONCLUSION Childhood asthma outcomes, including control, were improved during the first wave of the COVID19 pandemic, probably because of reduced exposure to asthma triggers and increased treatment adherence The decreased frequency of acute episodes does not support the notion that childhood asthma may be a risk factor for COVID19 Furthermore, the potential for improving childhood asthma outcomes through environmental control becomes apparent,BACKGROUND The newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARSCoV2 has caused a worldwide pandemic of human respiratory disease Angiotensinconverting enzyme ACE 2 is the key receptor on lung epithelial cells to facilitate initial binding and infection of SARSCoV2 The binding to ACE2 is mediated via the spike glycoprotein present on the viral surface Recent clinical data have demonstrated that patients with previous episodes of brain injuries are a highrisk group for SARSCoV2 infection An explanation for this finding is currently lacking Sterile tissue injuries including stroke induce the release of several inflammatory mediators that might modulate the expression levels of signaling proteins in distant organs Whether systemic inflammation following brain injury can specifically modulate ACE2 expression in different vital tissues has not been investigated METHODS For the induction of brain stroke, mice were subjected to a surgical procedure for transient interruption of blood flow in the middle cerebral artery for 45xa0min and sacrificed after 1 and 3xa0days for analysis of brain, lung, heart, and kidney tissues Gene expression and protein levels of ACE2, ACE, IL6 and IL1β were measured by quantitative PCR and Western blot, respectively The level of soluble ACE2 in plasma and bronchial alveolar lavage BAL was measured using an immunoassay Immune cell populations in lymphoid organs were analyzed by flow cytometry Poststroke pneumonia in mice was examined by bacterial cultures from lung homogenates and whole blood RESULTS Strikingly, 1xa0day after surgery, we observed a substantial increase in the protein levels of ACE2 in the lungs of stroke mice compared to shamoperated mice However, the protein levels of ACE2 were found unchanged in the heart, kidney, and brain of these animals In addition, we found increased transcriptional levels of alveolar ACE2 after stroke The increased expression of ACE2 was significantly associated with the severity of behavioral deficits after stroke The higher protein levels of alveolar ACE2 persisted until 3xa0days of stroke Interestingly, we found reduced levels of soluble ACE2 in plasma but not in BAL in strokeoperated mice compared to sham mice Furthermore, strokeinduced parenchymal and systemic inflammation was evident with the increased expression of IL6 and IL1β Reduced numbers of Tlymphocytes were present in the blood and spleen as an indicator of sterile tissue injuryinduced immunosuppression CONCLUSIONS We demonstrate specific augmented alveolar ACE2 levels and inflammation in murine lungs after experimental stroke These preclinical findings suggest that patients with brain injuries may have increased binding affinity to SARSCoV2 in their lungs which might explain why stroke is a risk factor for higher susceptibility to develop COVID19,,,Context As the COVID19 was spreading to all countries, its manifestations were identifying gradually, which were related to several organs Evidence Acquisition COVID19 is associated with distinct hematological changes, increased serum inflammatory markers, and coagulopathy Most of these changes are related to the patients prognosis and mortality, particularly in those with severe disease Results Firstly, we discussed the associations between COVID19 clinical features and complications, and secondly, its hematological findings and coagulopathy are investigated Conclusions Such associations not only may shed light on our prognostic view of patients with COVID19 but also will entail significant therapeutic implications One of its key implications is to utilize the mesenchymal stem cells MSCs to treat patients with COVID19 Herein, this kind of novel therapy will be discussed, as well,,Although primarily a respiratory illness, coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 has been associated with cardiac involvement with reported cases of myocardial ischemia, arrhythmia, myocarditis, pericarditis, and pericardial effusion leading to cardiac tamponade Most cases of pericardial disease in this setting have been during the acute infection Here, we present a patient who developed pericarditis leading to cardiac tamponade after the resolution of the acute COVID19 infection Her course of illness was further complicated by poor response to initial medical therapy with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs NSAIDs and colchicine which could possibly be related to early exposure to steroids It is often difficult to establish an underlying etiology for acute pericarditis Similarly, in our case, although there is no definitive test to prove the causal relationship, this effusion is highly suspicious of being secondary to post viral sequelae after COVID19 infection when considering the clinical course It is important to consider pericardial disease as a late complication of COVID19 even after apparent resolution of the acute infection and be mindful of the therapeutic challenges that we might face while managing such patients,AIMS Treatment with sodiumglucose cotransporter 2 SGLT2 inhibitors improves outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure HF with reduced ejection fraction There is limited experience with the inhospital initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with acute HF AHF with or without diabetes EMPULSE is designed to assess the clinical benefit and safety of the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin compared with placebo in patients hospitalized with AHF METHODS EMPULSE is a randomized, doubleblind, parallelgroup, placebocontrolled multinational trial comparing the inhospital initiation of empagliflozin 10u2009mg once daily with placebo Approximately 500 patients admitted for AHF with dyspnoea, signs of fluid overload, and elevated natriuretic peptides will be randomized 11 stratified to HF status denovo and decompensated chronic HF to either empagliflozin or placebo at approximately 165 sites across North America, Europe and Asia Patients will be enrolled regardless of ejection fraction and diabetes status and will be randomized during hospitalization and after stabilization between 24u2009h and 5u2009days after admission, with treatment continued up to 90u2009days after initiation The primary outcome is clinical benefit at 90u2009days, consisting of a composite of allcause death, HF events, and 5 point change from baseline in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire total symptom score KCCQTSS, assessed using a winratio approach Secondary outcomes include assessments of safety, change in KCCQTSS from baseline to 90u2009days and change in natriuretic peptides from baseline to 30u2009days CONCLUSION The EMPULSE trial will evaluate the clinical benefit and safety of empagliflozin in patients hospitalized for AHF,,A subgroup of COVID‐19 patients with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging evidence of myocardial inflammation may exhibit subendocardial fibrosis, compatible with myocardial infarction, while epicardial coronary arteries are normal A subgroup of COVID‐19 patients with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging evidence of myocardial inflammation may exhibit subendocardial fibrosis, compatible with myocardial infarction, while epicardial coronary arteries are normal,,AIMS Reperfusion therapy is the most common and effective treatment against ischemic heart disease IHD, but the process inflicts massive ischemiareperfusion IR injury for which no treatment exists Notably, reperfusion after ischemia causes ischemiareperfusion injury IR injury and the noreflow phenomenon seriously affecting the therapeutic effects in clinical practice The principle purpose of this study is to validate the effect of hydrogen gas on IHD and further explore the mechanism of hydrogen gas in alleviating myocardial IR injury and noreflow phenomenon MATERIALS AND METHODS The rat model of myocardial ischemiareperfusion was well established Myocardial infarct size was evaluated by TTC  Evans blue staining The noreflow area and the cardiac function were assessed by thioflavinS staining and echocardiography respectively Microstructure and mitochondria of myocardial tissue were assessed by transmission electron microscope Western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to evaluate the expression of NLRP3 mediated pyroptosis related proteins The 8OHdG, MDA and serum total ROS were used to evaluate the degree of oxidative stress KEY FINDINGS The myocardial infarct size, noreflow area, cardiac function, microstructure and mitochondrial morphology of IR model rats were significantly improved after hydrogen inhalation In addition, the expression of 8OHdG, MDA, ROS and NLRP3 mediated pyroptosis related proteins were significantly decreased SIGNIFICANCE We found that oxidative stress and NLRP3 mediated pyroptosis are the important mechanisms for hydrogen to alleviate myocardial IR injury, and we also confirmed that hydrogen can significantly improve no reflow phenomenon caused by ischemiareperfusion,Heart diseases are still among the main causes of death in the world population The use of tools able to discriminate early this type of problem, even by nonspecialized medical personnel on an outpatient basis, would put a decrease in health pressure on hospital centers and a better patient prognosis This paper focuses on the problem of cardiac akinesis, a condition attributable to a very large number of pathologies, and a possible serious complication for SARSCovid19 patients In particular, we considered echocardiographic images of both akinetic and healthy patients The dataset, containing echocardiograms of around 700 patients, has been supplied by Sacco hospital of Milan Italy We implemented a modified ResNet34 architecture and we tested the model under various combinations of parameters The final best performing model was able to achieve a F1score of 091 in the binary classification Akinetic vs Normokinetic,,ABSTRACT  Heart dysfunction, represented by conditions such as myocarditis and arrhythmia, has been reported in COVID19 patients Therapeutic strategies focused on the cardiovascular system, however, remain scarce The Sigma1 receptor S1R has been recently proposed as a therapeutic target because its inhibition reduces SARSCoV2 replication To investigate the role of S1R in SARSCoV2 infection in the heart, we used human cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells hiPSCCM as an experimental model Here we show that the S1R antagonist NE100 decreases SARSCoV2 infection and viral replication in hiPSCCMs Also, NE100 reduces cytokine release and cell death associated with infection Because S1R is involved in cardiac physiology, we investigated the effects of NE100 in cardiomyocyte morphology and function We show that NE100 compromises cytoskeleton integrity and reduces beating frequency, causing contractile impairment These results show that targeting S1R to challenge SARSCoV2 infection may be a useful therapeutic strategy but its detrimental effects in vivo on cardiac function should not be ignored,BACKGROUND Despite the advantages of bone marrow transplantation BMT, patients receiving this intervention visit the emergency department ED frequently and for various reasons Many of those ED visits result in hospitalization, and the length of stay varies OBJECTIVES The objective of our study was to identify the patients who were only briefly hospitalized and were thus eligible for safe discharge from the ED METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study conducted on all adult patients who have completed a successful BMT and had an ED visit that resulted in hospitalization RESULTS Our study included 115 unique BMT with a total number of 357 ED visits Around half of those visits resulted in a short hospitalization We found higher odds of a short hospitalization among those who have undergone autologous BMT 95CI 114265 Analysis of the discharge diagnoses showed that patients with gastroenteritis were more likely to have a shorter hospitalization in comparison to those diagnosed with others 95CI 110381 Furthermore, we showed that patients who presented after a month from their procedure were more likely to have a short hospitalization 95CI 104487 Another significant predictor of a short of hospitalization was the absence of Graft versus Host Disease GvHD 95CI 2531228 Additionally, patients with normal and high systolic blood pressure 95CI 222673 and 95CI 2811305 respectively, normal respiratory rate 95CI 2791017 and temperature 95CI 291744 were more likely to have a shorter hospitalization, compared to those presenting with abnormal vitals Likewise, we proved higher odds of a short hospitalization in patients with a quick Sepsis Related Organ Failure Assessment score of 12 95CI 129520 Moreover, we demonstrated higher odds of a short hospitalization in patients with a normal platelet count 95CI 139336 and creatinine level 95CI 130618 CONCLUSION In our study, we have shown that BMT patients visit the ED frequently and many of those visits result in a short hospitalization Our study showed that patients presenting with feverchills are less likely to have a short hospitalization We also showed a significant association between a short hospitalization and BMT patients without GvHD, with normal RR, normal T °C and a normal platelet count,,The manifestations of COVID19 as outlined by echocardiography, lung ultrasound LUS and cardiac magnetic resonance CMR imaging are yet to be fully described We conducted a systematic review of the current literature and included studies that described cardiovascular manifestations of COVID19 using echocardiography, LUS and CMR We queried PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science for relevant articles Original studies and case series were included This review describes the most common abnormalities encountered on echocardiography, LUS and CMR in patients infected with COVID19,Background Upper airway granulomas are commonly encountered benign masses and are a result of pronounced tissue reactivity to localized respiratory mucosal trauma The mechanism of injury to respiratory epithelium is most commonly iatrogenic and associated with intubation or indwelling tracheostomy Case Report A 40yearold obese female with a history of multiple intubations, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus type II, and history of tracheal stenosis presented with sudden onset respiratory distress requiring intubation at an outside hospital Direct laryngoscopy revealed a rapidly forming transglottic tissue mass, measuring 50u2009×u200922u2009×u200908u2009cm The following case represents an unusual exception to our experience with granulomas given its rapidity of onset and migration of tissue around the endotracheal tube Discussion Laryngeal erythema and granulation formation are expected postintubation findings in most patients however, the large size of granuloma tissue and rapid onset of symptoms in this case make it remarkable Our patient had multiple risk factors for postintubation stenosis female sex, poorly controlled diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and multiple prior intubations for periods lasting longer than fortyeight hours Conclusion Our case highlights a rare laryngeal finding of a large granulation tissue mass causing sudden onset airway obstruction,,Approximately 14 COVID19 patients, develop acute hypoxic respiratory failure A high flow nasal cannula device might be preferred to obtain an oxygen saturation above 90 in these cases In resource limited settings, where high flow nasal cannula is not an option, additional low flow oxygen therapy through nasal prongs could be added to nonrebreathing mask with a reservoir bag The possible mechanisms of the improved oxygenation could be 1 improved oxygenair mixing in large airways, 2 increased oxygen concentration inside the nonrebreathing mask, 3 decrease in rebreathing of carbondioxide from the nonrebreathing mask This method of oxygen supplementation is easy to assemble, costeffective and helpful in management of acute hypoxemic COVID19 patients, whenever there is crisis of high flow nasal cannula machine Its effectiveness needs to be assessed by a randomized controlled trial,The cardiac NaH exchanger NHE1 is a membrane glycoprotein fundamental for proper cell functioning due its multiple housekeeping tasks, including regulation of intracellular pH, Na concentration, and cell volume In the heart, hyperactivation of NHE1 has been linked to the development of different pathologies Several studies in animal models that reproduce the deleterious effects of ischemiareperfusion injury or cardiac hypertrophy have conclusively demonstrated that NHE1 inhibition provides cardioprotection Unfortunately, NHE1 inhibitors failed to reproduce these effects in the clinical arena The reasons for those discrepancies are not apparent yet However, a reasonable clue to consider would be that drugs that completely abolish the exchanger activity, including that its essential housekeeping function may not be the best therapeutic approach Therefore, interventions tending to specifically reduce its hyperactive state without affecting its basal activity emerge as a novel potential gold standard In this regard, a promising goal seems to be the modulation of the phosphorylation state of the cytosolic tail of the exchanger Recent own experiments demonstrated that Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase 5A inhibitor drug that has been widely used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction is able to decrease NHE1 phosphorylation, and hence reduce its hyperactivity In connection, growing evidence demonstrates cardioprotective properties of Sildenafil against different cardiac pathologies, with the distinctive characteristic of directly affecting cardiac tissue without altering blood pressure This minireview was aimed to focus on the regulation of NHE1 activity by Sildenafil For this purpose, experimental data reporting Sildenafil effects in different animal models of heart disease will be discussed,Recent advances in the description of the tumor microenvironment of acute myeloid leukemia, including the comprehensive analysis of the leukemic stem cell niche and clonal evolution, indicate that inflammation may play a major role in many aspects of acute myeloid leukemia AML such as disease progression, chemoresistance, and myelosuppression Studies on the mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapy or tyrosine kinase inhibitors along with highthroughput drug screening have underpinned the potential role of glucocorticoids in this disease classically described as steroidresistant in contrast to acute lymphoblastic leukemia Moreover, some mutated oncogenes such as RUNX1, NPM1, or SRSF2 transcriptionally modulate cell state in a manner that primes leukemic cells for glucocorticoid sensitivity In clinical practice, inflammatory markers such as serum ferritin or IL6 have a strong prognostic impact and may directly affect disease progression, whereas interesting preliminary data suggested that dexamethasone may improve the outcome for AML patients with a high white blood cell count, which paves the way to develop prospective clinical trials that evaluate the role of glucocorticoids in AML,A novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has widely affected the global community After months of extensive effort, much remains to be understood of the pathogenesis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID19 The available evidence raises a critical question  Is COVID19 a lung disorder leading to circulatory problems, or a systemic disorder that leads to lung problems If the latter scenario is correct, investigations on hypoxia conditions and the development of antihypoxia agents may lead to potential frontline treatments in combination with antivirals for hypoxemic COVID19 patients Hence, antihypoxic agents may become a potential part of combination therapy in hypoxemic respiratory failure and COVID19,Asthma is a chronic, heterogeneous and frequent pathology of the respiratory tract, which can become disabling and whose socioeconomic cost is significant Therapeutic strategies are multiple and complex Adherence and compliance with treatment are often poor The dispensing pharmacist can carry out pharmaceutical interviews toxa0promote therapeutic education and therefore the control of asthma,Background Antimelanoma differentiationassociated gene 5 MDA5positive dermatomyositis DMassociated interstitial lung disease ILD is a lifethreatening disease with a 6month mortality as high as 50 Evaluation of pulmonary highresolution computed tomography HRCT is crucial in the prognostic prediction This study aimed to develop a novel CT visual scoring method for antiMDA5 positive DMILDMethods A prospective cohort of hospitalized patients with antiMDA5 positive DMILD was analyzed, and was further divided into a derivation dataset and a validation dataset The primary outcome was the sixmonth allcause mortality since the time of admission Three components of baseline pulmonary CT images, ie, ground glass opacity GGO, consolidation and fibrosis were semiquantitatively calculated in different lung lobes The multivariable COX proportional hazards model was used to identify independent prognostic risk factors and corresponding coefficients, based upon which a scoring model was constructed In addition, an artificial intelligence AI algorithmbased analysis and an idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis IPFbased scoring were conducted as comparators The prediction accuracy of different methods was measured and compared by Harrell concordance index Cindex Results Overall, 173 eligible patients were included A novel GGO and consolidationweighted CT visual scoring model for antiMDA5 positive DMILD, namely MDA5 score, was developed with Cindex values of 080 95CI 075086 in the derivation dataset n116 and 084 95CI 071097 in the validation dataset n57, respectively While, the AI algorithmbased analysis, namely AI score, yielded Cindex 078 95CI 072084 for the derivation dataset and 077 95CI 064090 for the validation dataset MDA5 score outperformed and IPFbased scoring IPF score with respect to discrimination and clinical usefulnessConclusions The novel derived MDA5 score may serve as an applicable prognostic predictor for antiMDA5 positive DMILD and facilitate further clinical trial design The AI based CT quantitative analysis from COVID19 provided a promising solution for ILD evaluation,Belgian Society of Cardiology 40th Annual Congress 11th  12th February 2021  Virtual Event President Prof Patrizio LancellottiAbstracts are identified as follows Best Abstracts by  and

the hypersusceptibility of airway inflammatory response remain unclear Methods The primary human bronchial epithelial cells pHBECs were isolated from normal and COPD bronchial tissues NHBE and DHBE and cultured withwithout IAV infection in vitro DHBE cells were exposed to IAV for 24 h after knockdown of lncRNA TUG1 with short hairpin RNA shRNA Gainoffunction assays were performed with the miR1455p inhibitor and NFκBp65 transfection The expressions of lncRNA TUG1, miR1455p, phosphoNFκBp65, NFκBp65, TNFα, and Interleukin IL1β were examined with qRTPCR, Western blotting, and ELISA The interactions of lncRNA TUG1, miR1455p, and NFκB were verified with luciferase reporter assay Results The expressions of lncRNA TUG1, phosphoNFκBp65, TNFα, and IL1β were increased significantly in pHBECs after being infected with IAV for 24 h all p005 The detailed time analysis revealed that the NFκBp65 in DHBE was activated earlier than that in NHBE by Western blotting and immunofluorescence Knockdown of lncRNA TUG1 and miR1455p mimic attenuated the expressions of NFκBp65, TNFα, and IL1β significantly The miR1455p inhibitor and NFκBp65 transfection reversed the attenuated expressions of NFκBp65, TNFα, and IL1β Conclusion The IAV causes the hypersusceptibility of airway inflammatory response, which may be closely associated with more severe symptoms in AECOPD patients The lncRNA TUG1 inhibitor may be a promising therapeutic strategy for AECOPD caused by IAV,This article reviews nasal structure and function in the light of intranasal pharmacotherapy The nose provides an accessible, fast route for local treatment of nose and sinus diseases, with lower doses than are necessary systemically and few adverse effects It can also be used for other medications as it has sufficient surface area protected from local damage by mucociliary clearance, absence of digestive enzymes, responsive blood flow, and provides a rapid route to the central nervous system,Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ACE2 is a main receptor for SARSCoV2 entry to the host cell ACE2 is one of the key enzymes in reninangiotensin system and plays a vital role in the maintenance of cardiovascular function ACEACE2 balance is critical in the regulation of blood pressure, electrolyte homeostasis, vascular and cardiac remodeling and inflammation ACE2 was shown to be abundantly present in human epithelial cells of the lung and enterocytes of the small intestine as well as in endothelial cells of the arterial and venous vessels ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are colocalized on the cell surface and produced a critical step host cell entry of SARSCoV2 TMPRSS2cleaved ACE2 permits SARSCoV2 host cell entry however, ADAM17cleaved ACE2 produces protective effects in several organs Differently, basigin CD147 was suggested as a putative alternate receptor for SARSCoV2 entry into endothelial cells The intestinal ACE2 receptor is associated with the neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1 and ACE2 is necessary for the expression of this transporter on the luminal surface of intestinal epithelial cells There is a good association between the localization of SARSCoV2 binding receptor ACE2 and the disease target organs in respiratory, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems Decreased expression of ACE2, being a receptor for coronavirus, would prevent cellular entry of the virus thereby reducing progression of the infection However, increased ACE2 expression produces beneficial health effects Further studies are needed to clarify this conflicting situation Currently, it is recommended to continue the therapy with ACE2increasing drugs in patients with COVID19,The lung is the main affected organ in severe coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 caused by the novel coronavirus SARSCoV2, and lung damage is the leading cause of death in the vast majority of patients Mainly based on results obtained by autopsies, the seminal features of fatal COVID19 have been described by many groups worldwide Early changes encompass edema, epithelial damage, and capillaritisendothelialitis, frequently combined with microthrombosis Subsequently, patients with manifest respiratory insufficiency exhibit exudative diffuse alveolar damage DAD with hyaline membrane formation and pneumocyte type 2 hyperplasia, variably complicated by superinfection, which may progress to organizingfibrotic stage DAD These features, however, are not specific for COVID19 and can be found in other disorders including viral infections Clinically, the early disease stage of severe COVID19 is characterized by high viral load, lymphopenia, massive secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and hypercoagulability, documented by elevated Ddimers and an increased frequency of thrombotic and thromboembolic events, whereas virus loads and cytokine levels tend to decrease in late disease stages, when tissue repair including angiogenesis prevails The present review describes the spectrum of lung pathology based on the current literature and the authors personal experience derived from clinical autopsies, and tries to summarize our current understanding and open questions of the pathophysiology of severe pulmonary COVID19,,Background Pulse oximetry is used as an assessment tool to gauge the severity of COVID19 infection and identify patients at risk of poor outcomes 1,2,3,4 The pandemic highlights the need for accurate pulse oximetry, particularly at home, as infection rates increase in multiple global regions including the UK, USA and South Africa 5  Over 100 million Samsung smartphones containing dedicated biosensors Maxim Integrated Inc, San Jose, CA and preloaded Apps to perform pulse oximetry, are in use globally We performed detailed in human hypoxia testing on the Samsung S9 smartphone to determine if this integrated hardware meets full FDAISO requirements for clinical pulse oximetry Methods The accuracy of integrated pulse oximetry in the Samsung 9 smartphone during stable arterial oxygen saturations SaO 2  between 70 and 100 was evaluated in 12 healthy subjects Inspired oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide partial pressures were monitored and adjusted via a partial rebreathing circuit to achieve stable target SaO 2 plateaus between 70 and 100 Arterial blood samples were taken at each plateau and saturation measured on each blood sample using ABL90FLEX blood gas analyzer Bias, calculated from smartphone readings minus the corresponding arterial blood sample, was reported as root mean square deviation RMSD Findings The RMSD of the over 257 data points based on blood sample analysis obtained from 12 human volunteers tested was 26 Interpretation Evaluation of the smartphone pulse oximeter performance is within requirements of 35 RMSD blood oxygen saturation SpO 2  value for FDAISO clearance for clinical pulse oximetry This is the first report of smartphone derived pulse oximetry measurements that meet full FDAISO accuracy certification requirements Both Samsung S9 and S10 contain the same integrated pulse oximeter, thus over 100 million smartphones in current global circulation could be used to obtain clinically accurate spot SpO 2 measurements to support at home assessment of COVID19 patients,,Concern has been raised that treatment with angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers may increase the expression of angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 ACE2, which acts as the entry receptor for SARS‐CoV‐2, and lead to an increased risk of death from SARS‐CoV‐2 We aimed to address this concern by evaluating the in vivo relationship of treatment with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers ARB with circulating plasma concentrations of ACE2 in a large cohort of patients with established cardiovascular disease n  1864 or cardiovascular risk factors n  2144 but without a history of heart failure Angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 was measured in 4008 patients median age 68, 33 women, 31 on ACE‐inhibitors, 31 on ARB using the SOMAscan proteomic platform SomaLogic Inc, Colorado, USA Plasma concentration of ACE2 was comparable in 1250 patients on ACE inhibitors mean 599 versus patients without ACE inhibitors mean 598, P  054 Similarly, plasma concentration of ACE2 was comparable in 1260 patients on ARB mean 599 versus patients without ARB mean 598, P  050 Plasma concentration of ACE2 was comparable in 2474 patients on either ACE inhibitors or ARB mean 599 versus patients without ACE inhibitors or ARB mean 598, P  031 Multivariable quantile regression model analysis confirmed the lack of association between treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARB and ACE2 concentrations Body mass index showed the only positive association with ACE2 plasma concentration effect 0015, 95 confidence interval 0002 to 0028, P  0024 In a large cohort of patients with established cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors but without heart failure, ACE inhibitors and ARB were not associated with higher plasma concentrations of ACE2,Objectives This pilot study sought to assess feasibility of a randomized trial of blood pressure intervention home blood pressure monitoring vs counseling in the preoperative clinic and the baseline rates of primary care followup after such interventionsMethods A prospective randomized pilot study was performed at Yale New Haven Hospital Preadmission Testing Clinic A sample of 100 adults with elevated blood pressure, were recruited during their preadmission visit, and randomized 11 to receive brief BP counseling and an educational brochure versus additionally receiving a home BP monitor HBPM with a mailed report of their home readings At 60day postsurgery telephone followup, investigators asked whether participants had primarycare followup had newadjusted hypertension treatment and felt satisfied with the studyResults There were 51 patients in the counseling group and 49 in the HBPM group Of 46 patients in the HBPM group who returned their monitors, 36 78 were hypertensive at home At 60 days postsurgery, 31 61 patients in the counseling group and 30 61 in the HBPM group were reached by telephone with the remaining followed by EMR 36 71 patients in the counseling group and 36 73 in the HBPM group had seen their Primary Care provider 17 of 36 47 in the counseling group and 18 of 31 58 in the HBPM group received new or adjusted hypertension medications 61 participants answered questions regarding their satisfaction with the study with 52 85 reporting that they felt moderately to very satisfied Conclusions This pilot study suggests that interventional blood pressure trials in the preoperative clinic are feasible, but telephone followup leads to significant gaps in outcome ascertainment Trial Registration Clinicaltrialsgov, NCT03634813 Registered 16 of August 2018, httpsclinicaltrialsgovct2showNCT03634813,Heart Teams have come to occupy a prominent place in modern cardiovascular disease While the concept is intuitively obvious  bringing together specialties of diverse backgrounds to focus on care of the individual patient  they have been harder to actually implement in clinical practice and it has been difficult to define metrics of success One documented metric has been the design, implementation, and end result of randomized clinical trials that were conducted with coinvestigators of both interventional cardiology and cardiovascular surgery which resulted in pivotal presentations of outcomes in specific patient groups This metric, however, has come under scrutiny because of trial performance, conclusions, and implications for practice The resulting controversies should not result in retreat from the concept of the Heart Team which should be at the heart of optimizing care for individual patients based upon scientific evidence and expert consensus on the issues of optimal cardiovascular care The widespread use of telemedicine can play a major role in enhancing decision making by the Heart Team Abbreviations IC Interventional Cardiology CVS Cardiovascular Surgery CABG Coronary artery bypass grafting PCI Percutaneous coronary intervention CAD Coronary artery disease

Administration,Background To determine risk factors for pneumothorax associated with computed tomography CTguided percutaneous core needle biopsy PCNB of the lung Whether the lung function characteristics are related to pneumothorax is unclear This study was designed to provide a risk assessment of pneumothorax based on pulmonary function analysis, which can predict the risk especially for patients with severe pulmonary dysfunctionMethods We retrospectively evaluated 343 patients who received CTguided pulmonary PCNBs and underwent preoperative pulmonary function testing Demographical, lesionrelated, procedurerelated features and histopathological diagnosis, as well as results of pulmonary function test were analyzed for risk factors of pneumothoraxResults Variables associated with higher rate of pneumothorax were location of lesion, presence of emphysema and dwell time Furthermore, there was significant difference of pulmonary function parameters between groups with or without pneumothorax as expressed by FEV1FVC ratio, FEV1FVC ratio , pred, FEF50  pred, FEF75  pred, and FEF25u2009u200975  pred Obstructive pulmonary function abnormalities were associated with a higher incidence of pneumothorax However, no correlation was found between the pneumothorax rate and the severity of pulmonary function abnormalities Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed lower location of lesion sampled and presence of emphysema were independent predictors of pneumothoraxConclusions Patients with obstructive pulmonary dysfunction have a higher risk of pneumothorax FEV1FVC ratio, FEF50, FEF75 and FEF25u2009u200975 has the potential to identify the highrisk population of pneumothorax,Despite improvements, lung transplantation LTx remains hampered by both a scarcity of donor organs and by mortality following primary graft dysfunction PGD Since acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS limits donor lungs utilization, we investigated cytokine filtration as a means of restoring ARDS donor lungs We induced mild to moderate ARDS using lipopolysaccharide in 12 donor pigs Lungs were then treated with or without cytokine filtration during ex vivo lung perfusion EVLP and posttransplantation using extracorporeal hemoperfusion The treatment significantly decreased cytokine levels during EVLP and decreased levels of immune cells posttransplantation Histology demonstrated fewer signs of lung injury across both treatment periods and the incidence of PGD was significantly reduced among treated animals Overall, cytokine filtration was able to restore lung function and reduce PGD in lung transplantation We suggest this treatment will increase the availability of donor lungs and increase the tolerability of donor lungs in the recipient,COVID19, caused by SARSCoV2 involves multiple organs including cardiovascular, pulmonary and central nervous system Understanding how SARSCoV2 infection afflicts diverse organ systems remains challenging 1,2  Particularly vexing has been the problem posed by persistent organ dysfunction known as long COVID, which includes cognitive impairment 3  Here we provide evidence linking SARSCoV2 infection to activation of TGFß signaling and oxidative overload One consequence is oxidation of the ryanodine receptorcalcium Ca 2  release channels RyR on the endosarcoplasmic ERSR reticuli in heart, lung and brains of patients who succumbed to COVID19 This depletes the channels of the stabilizing subunit calstabin2 causing them to leak Ca 2 which can promote heart failure 4,5 , pulmonary insufficiency 6 and cognitive and behavioral defects 79  Exvivo treatment of heart, lung, and brain tissues from COVID19 patients using a Rycal drug ARM210 10 prevented calstabin2 loss and fixed the channel leak Of particular interest is that neuropathological pathways activated downstream of leaky RyR2 channels in Alzheimers Disease AD patients were activated in COVID19 patients Thus, leaky RyR2 Ca 2 channels may play a role in COVID19 pathophysiology and could be a therapeutic target for amelioration of some comorbidities associated with SARSCoV2 infection,The rapid spread of SARSCoV2 COVID19 since December 2019 forced Intensive Care Units to face high numbers of patients admitted simultaneously with limited resources COVID19 critically ill patients, especially those on mechanical ventilators, demand special attention as they can develop potential complications with critical hemodynamic and respiratory consequences Point of Care Ultrasound POCUS might have important roles in assessing the critically ill SARSCoV2 patient Mostly, lung ultrasound has been presented as having a role in diagnosis and monitoring, but airway examination and hemodynamic evaluation are of interest also We propose an ABC POCUS approach focusing on Aairway orotracheal intubation, Bbreathing interstitial syndromes, pneumothorax, atelectasis, pneumonia, and Ccirculation cardiac function, pulmonary embolism, volume status, deep veins thrombosis This ABC approach has emerged during ICU care for 22 adult COVID19 critically ill patients, along with the analysis of recent papers describing ultrasound in COVID19 patients including the use of ultrasound that is currently applied in the management of the general critically ill population This ABC POCUS algorithm parallels the wellestablished clinical ABC algorithms There are few extensive ultrasonographic studies in COVID19 critically ill patients up to now, but techniques extrapolated from nonCOVID studies seem reasonable even though comparative studies are not available yet,SARSCoV2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19, is responsible for the largest pandemic facing humanity since the Spanish flu pandemic in the early twentieth century Since there is no specific antiviral treatment, optimized support is the most relevant factor in the patients prognosis In the hospital setting, the identification of highrisk patients for clinical deterioration is essential to ensure access to intensive treatment of severe conditions in a timely manner The initial management of hypoxemia includes conventional oxygen therapy, highflow nasal canula oxygen, and noninvasive ventilation For patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, lungprotective ventilation with low tidal volumes and plateau pressure is recommended Cardiovascular complications are frequent and include myocardial injury, thrombotic events, myocarditis, and cardiogenic shock Acute renal failure is a common complication and is a marker of poor prognosis, with significant impact in costs and resources allocation Regarding promising therapies for COVID19, the most promising drugs until now are remdesivir and corticosteroids although further studies may be needed to confirm their effectiveness Other therapies such as, tocilizumab, anakinra, other anticytokine drugs, and heparin are being tested in clinical trials Thousands of physicians are living a scenario that none of us have ever seen demand for hospital exceed capacity in most countries Until now, the certainty we have is that we should try to decrease the number of infected patients and that an optimized critical care support is the best strategy to improve patients survival,The COVID19 pandemic has become a burden to the global healthcare community Despite the severity of the complications associated with COVID19, no antiviral agent is yet available for the treatment of this disease Several studies have reported arrhythmias as one of the numerous manifestations associated with COVID19 infection Clinicians use different therapeutic agents in the management of COVID19 patients with arrhythmias, apart from ranolazine however, some of these drugs are administered with caution because of their significant side effects In this study, we reviewed the potential antiarrhythmic effects of ranolazine in the management of cardiac arrhythmias associated with COVID19 Ranolazine is a secondline drug approved for the treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris Previous studies have shown that ranolazine produces its beneficial cardiac effects without any significant impact on the bodys hemodynamics hence, blood pressure is not altered Due to its reduced side effects, ranolazine may be more effective than other drugs in producing the desired relief from COVID19 related arrhythmias, since it produces its antiarrhythmic effect by modulating sodium, potassium and calcium channels, and suppressing cytokine expression,BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 has caused a global pandemic that has raised worldwide concern This study aims to investigate the correlation between the extent of lung infection and relevant clinical laboratory testing indicators in COVID19 and to analyse its underlying mechanismMethodsChest highresolution computer tomography CT images and laboratory examination data of 31 patients with COVID19 were extracted, and the lesion areas in CT images were quantitatively segmented and calculated using a deep learning DL system A crosssectional study method was carried out to explore the differences among the proportions of lung lobe infection and to correlate the percentage of infection POI of the whole lung in all patients with clinical laboratory examination valuesResultsNo significant difference in the proportion of infection was noted among various lung lobes Pu2009u2009005 The POI of total lung was negatively correlated with the peripheral blood lymphocyte percentage L ru2009u2009u20090633, P,By the beginning of 2020, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 infection has rapidly evolved into an emergent worldwide pandemic, an outbreak whose unprecedented consequences highlighted the existing flaws within the global public healthcare systems While the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is bestowed with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestation involving vital organs, the respiratory system transpires as the main route of entry of SARSCoV2, with the lungs being its primary target Of those infected, up to 20 require hospitalization on account of severity, while the majority of patients are either asymptomatic or exhibit mild symptoms Exacerbation in disease severity and complications of COVID19 infection have been allied with multiple comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disorders, cancer, and chronic lung disease Interestingly, a recent body of evidence have foregrounded the pulmonary and gut microbiome as potential modulators in altering the course of COVID19, plausibly via the microbiomeimmune system axis While relative concordance between microbes and immunity is still not fully elucidated in a COVID19 disease context, we present here an overview of our current understanding of this COVID19microbiomeimmune cross talk and discuss the potential contributions of microbiomerelated immunity to SARSCoV2 pathogenesis and COVID19 disease progression,Hyperinflammatory responses induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 are a major cause of disease severity and death Predictive prognosis biomarkers to guide therapeutics are critically lacking Several studies have indicated a cytokine storm with the release of interleukin1 IL1, IL6, and IL8, along with tumor necrosis factor alpha TNFα and other inflammatory mediators Here, we proposed to assess the relationship between IL6 and outcomes of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 Our cohort consisted of 46 adult patients with PCRproven SARSCoV2 infection admitted in a COVID19 ward of the Hospital de Braga HB from April 7 to May 7, 2020, whose IL6 levels were followed over time We found that IL6 levels were significantly different between the disease stages Also, we found a significant negative correlation between IL6 levels during stages IIb and III, peripheral oxygen saturation SpO2, and partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood PaO2, showing that IL6 correlates with respiratory failure Compared to the inflammatory markers available in the clinic routine, we found a positive correlation between IL6 and Creactive protein CRP However, when we assessed the predictive value of these two markers, IL6 behaves as a better predictor of disease progression In a binary logistic regression, IL6 level was the most significant predictor of the nonsurvivors group, when compared to age and CRP Herein, we present IL6 as a relevant tool for prognostic evaluation, mainly as a predictor of outcome,,LUS patterns of COVID19 pneumonia have been described and shown to be characteristic The aim of the study was to predict the prognosis of patients with COVID19 pneumonia, using a score based on LUS findings MATERIALS AND METHODS u2002An observational, retrospective study was conducted on patients admitted to Niguarda hospital with a diagnosis of COVID19 pneumonia during the period of a month, from March 2nd to April 3rd 2020 Demographics, clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings were collected LUS was performed in all patients The chest was divided into 12 areas The LUS report was drafted using a score from 0 to 3 with 0xa0corresponding to A pattern, 1 corresponding to well separated vertical artifacts B lines, 2 corresponding to white lung and small consolidations, 3 corresponding to wide consolidations The total score results from the sum of the scores for each area The primary outcome was endotracheal intubation, no active further management, or death The secondary outcome was discharge from the emergency room ER RESULTS u2002255 patients were enrolled 937u200a had a positive

epithelium protects us from environmental insults, which we encounter with every breath Not only does it passively filter large particles, it also senses potential danger and alerts other cells, including immune and nervous cells Together, these tissues orchestrate the most appropriate response, balancing the need to eliminate the danger with the risk of damage to the host Each cell subset within the airway epithelium plays its part, and when impaired, may contribute to the development of respiratory disease Here we highlight recent advances regarding the cellular and functional heterogeneity along the airway epithelium and discuss how we can use this knowledge to design more effective, targeted therapeutics,The aim was to evaluate the ventilation inhomogeneity VIH by the multiplebreath nitrogen washout test MBNW after COVID19 and to identify the relationship of the lung clearance index LCI with other functional parameters of the respiratory system Methods The crosssectional study included 35 patients 97 men the median age was 44 years Spirometry, body plethysmography, diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide DL co , MBNW test, and impulse oscillometry were performed Dyspnea was evaluated by mMRC scale MBNW test was performed using the Easyone Pro, MBW Module ndd Medizintechnik AG, Switzerland Results  The patients were divided into 2 groups Group 1 included 21 60 patients who were not diagnosed with VIH Group 2 included 14 40 patients with VIH The median testing period was 72 47  109 days from the onset of COVID19 The median of the maximum volume of lung damage determined by highresolution computed tomography CT max  was 50 in the acute period of the disease and 12 during the study The medians of all analyzed parameters remained normal in the study cohort as well as in groups 1 and 2, except the resonance frequency f res  in group 2 Statistically significant differences were found between groups 1 and 2 in the absolute frequency dependence of resistance R5  R20, reactance area A X , f res  Significant differences were also found in pathological changes of vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in the

patients, decreased DL co  in 23, airway obstruction  in 114, and restrictive ventilatory defect  in 86 Correlations were found between LCI and DL co , spirometry parameters, body plethysmography, impulse oscillometry, and CT max ,COVID19 has rapidly spread around the world and threatened global health Although this disease mainly affects the respiratory system, there is increasing evidence that SARSCoV2 also has effects on the cardiovascular system Echocardiography is a valuable tool in the assessment of cardiovascular disease It is costeffective, widely available and provides information that can influence management Given the risk of personnel infection and equipment contamination during echocardiography, leading world societies have recommended performing echocardiography only when a clinical benefit is likely, favouring focused evaluations and using smaller portable equipment In the past months, multiple reports have described a wide pattern of echocardiographic abnormalities in patients with COVID19 This review summarised these findings and discussed the possible mechanisms involved,Background An estimated 50 of nursing home NH residents experience hospital transfers in their last year of life, often due to infections Hospital transfers due to infection are often of little clinical benefit to residents with advanced illness, for whom aggressive treatments are often ineffective and inconsistent with goals of care Integration of palliative care and infection management ie, merging the goals of palliative care and infection management at end of life may reduce hospital transfers for residents with advanced illness Objectives Evaluate the association between integration and 1 allcause hospital transfers and 2 hospital transfers due to infection Design Crosssectional observational study SettingSubjects 143,223 US NH residents, including 42,761 residents in the advanced stages of dementia, congestive heart failure CHF, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD Measurement Crosssectional, nationally representative NH survey data 20172018 were combined with resident data from the Minimum Data Set 30 and Medicare inpatient data 20162017 NH surveys measured integration of palliative care and infection management using an index of 0100 Logistic regression models were used to estimate the relationships between integration intensity ie, the degree to which NHs follow best practices for integration and allcause hospital transfer and transfer due to infection Results Among residents with advanced dementia, integration intensity was inversely associated with allcause hospital transfer and transfer due to infection pu2009u20090001 Among residents with advanced COPD, integration intensity was inversely associated with allcause hospital transfer pu2009u2009005 but not transfers due to infection Among residents with advanced CHF, integration intensity was not associated with either outcome Conclusions NH policies aimed to promote integration of palliative care and infection management may reduce burdensome hospital transfers for residents with advanced dementia For residents with advanced CHF and COPD, alternative strategies may be needed to promote best practices for infection management at end of life,BackgroundThe respiratory system involvement is the most common presentation of Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 However, other organs including the central nervous system CNS could be affected by the virus Strokes, seizures, change in mental status, and encephalitis have been reported as the neurological manifestation of the disease We hypothesized that COVID19 could predispose younger patients to spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage ICH The present study aimed to investigate whether COVID19 has any relationship with the occurrence of spontaneous ICH in young or notMethodsWe retrospectively evaluated all the patients with spontaneous ICH who were referred to our center between 20 Feb and 1 Sep 2020 The demographic, clinical, radiological, and laboratory test data were evaluated Patients were divided into two groups The COVID19 positive patients and COVID19 negative ones All the variables including age, sex, history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, Glasgow Coma Scale GCS, hematoma volume and location, the presence of intraventricular hemorrhage and hydrocephalus on admission, the length of hospital stay, the lab test results and the clinical outcome at last visit or discharge as Glasgow Outcome Scale GOS were compared between the two groupsResultsThere were 22 COVID19 positive patients 208 and 84 COVID19 negative ones 792 The mean age of the patients in the case group 5427u2009u2009467 was significantly lower than that in the control group 6988u2009u2009447 pu2009u2009005ConclusionsOur results show that COVID positive patients with ICH are younger and with less predisposing factors than COVID negative subjects with ICH,BACKGROUND An established objective and standardized reporting of clinical severity and disease progression in COVID19 is still not established We validated and compared the usefulness of two classification systems reported earliera severity grading proposed by Siddiqi and a system from the National Australian COVID19 guideline Both had not been validated externally and were now tested for their ability to predict complications METHODS In this retrospective, singlecentre observational study, patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID19 across all severity stages were enrolled The clinical severity was graded at admission and during hospitalization Multivariate Cox regression was used to identify independent risk factors for mortality, a composite primary mortality, incident acute respiratory distress syndrome, incident mechanical ventilation, a secondary endpoint mortality, incident acute myocardial injury, incident venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism or stroke and progression of severity grades RESULTS Of 109 patients 17 died, 31 and 48 developed the primary and secondary endpoint, respectively Worsening of the severity grade by at least one stage occurred in 27 and 28 patients, respectively Siddiqi and Australian classification were identified as independent predictors for the primary endpoint adjusted hazard ratio aHR 230, p0001 and aHR 208, p0001, for the secondary endpoint aHR 212, p0001 and aHR 179, p0001 and mortality aHR 230, p  0071 and aHR 198, p  0017 Both classification systems showed very good agreement regarding initial grading and good agreement regarding progression of severity stages CONCLUSIONS Standardized and objective severity grading is useful to unequivocally stratify patients presenting with COVID19 for their individual risk of complications,INTRODUCTION Patients with severe COVID19 develops an acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS, requiring admission to the intensive care unit COVID19 also reports an increased prevalence of comorbidities, similar to patients with Sleep disorder breathing SDB OBJECTIVES To evaluate the association between undiagnosed SDB and the risk of ARDS and pulmonary abnormalities in a cohort of patients survivors of COVID19 between 3 and 6 months after diagnosis METHODS Prospective cohort study of patients who developed ARDS during hospitalization due to COVID19 compared with a control group of patients who had COVID19 with mild to moderate symptoms All patients were evaluated between the 12th and 24th week after SARSCoV2 infection The evaluation includes persistent symptoms, lung diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide DLCO, chest CT scan and home sleep apnea test SDB was diagnosed by the respiratory disturbance index 5 evh The association between SDB and ARDS, the hazards of lung impairment and the hazard ratios HR were analyzed RESULTS A total of 60 patients were included ARDS 34 patients, Control 26 patients The mean followup was 16 weeks range 1224 ARDS reported a high prevalence of SDB 79 vs 38 in control group A total of 35 reported DLCO impairment, and 676 abnormal chest CT SDB was independently associated to ARDS, OR 672 CI, 1562893, p,,,,A 44yearold woman with a history of factor V Leiden deficiency and recurrent pulmonary emboli was diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 three weeks prior presented to her local ED with severe chest pain She was found to have a large hemorrhagic pericardial effusion by cardiac MRI with echocardiographic signs of tamponade She underwent the creation of a pericardial window and was treated with colchicine with improvement in symptoms,,The world changed in few months after the emergence of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19, caused by a beta coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 The transmission of COVID19 is most commonly secondary to the exposure to infected droplets Prolonged exposure to an infected person is related to an increase in the transmission risk Asymptomatic and presymptomatic carriers can transmit SARSCoV2 Cardiovascular risk factors and chronic cardiovascular conditions are prevalent among patients affected by COVID 19 and associated with adverse outcomes Besides that COVID19 has also demonstrated damage to the cardiovascular system with several manifestations, such as myocardial injury, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, Takotsubo syndrome, arrhythmias, myocarditis, and shock In this chapter we review the relationship of COVID19 and cardiovascular risk factors and diseases Best practices, strategies, precautions, and experiences to manage the risks of COVID19 in nuclear cardiology departments are addressed,,Background The elderly multimorbid patient is at high risk of adverse outcomes with COVID19 complications, and in the general population, the development of incident AF is associated with worse outcomes in such patients We therefore investigated incident AF risks in a large prospective population of elderly patients withwithout incident COVID19 cases and baseline cardiovascularnoncardiovascular multimorbidities We used two approaches maineffect modeling and secondly, a machinelearning ML approach accounting for complex dynamic relationships Methods We studied a prospective elderly US cohort of 280592 patients from medical databases in a 8month investigation of new COVID19 cases Incident AF outcomes were examined in relationship to diverse multimorbid conditions, COVID19 status and demographic variables, with ML accounting for the dynamic nature of changing multimorbidity risk factors Results Multimorbidity contributed to the onset of confirmed COVID19 cases with cognitive impairment OR 169 95CI 152188, anemia OR 141 95CI 132150, diabetes mellitus OR 135 95CI 127144 and vascular disease OR 130 95CI 121139 having the highest associations A main effect model Cindex value 0718 showed that COVID19 had the highest association with incident AF cases OR 312 95CI 2613710, followed by congestive heart failure 172 95CI 150196, then coronary artery disease OR 143 95CI 127160 and valvular disease 142 95CI 126160 The ML algorithm demonstrated improved discriminatory validity incrementally over the statistical main effect model training Cindex 0729, 95CI 07180740 validation Cindex 0704, 95CI 0687072 Calibration of ML based formulation was satisfactory and better than the maineffect model Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the clinical utility for the ML based formulation was better than the treat all strategy and the main effect model Conclusion COVID19 status has major implications for incident AF in a cohort with diverse cardiovascularnoncardiovascular multimorbidities Our approach accounting for dynamic multimorbidity changes had good prediction for incident AF amongst incident COVID19 cases,Background Severe coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is associated with pathological elevations of tumor necrosis factoralpha TNFɑ and interleukin 6 IL6 These cause extreme elevations of the acute phase reactant fibrinogen and plasma viscosity Severe COVID19 is also associated with poorly understood complications including a high incidence of arterial and venous thrombosis despite prophylactic anticoagulation, silent hypoxemia, pulmonary microvascular thrombosis, excess neutrophil extracellular trap formation, encephalopathy, and cardiac dysfunction Aims To investigate the cause of this pathological inflammatory response, the authors determined the number of purineuridineuridinepurineuridine purUUpurU motifs in the genomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 and other RNA viruses This motif is the precursor to the oligonucleotide which is the minimal motif required to activate inflammation via tolllike receptor 8 TLR8 A genome containing the same nucleotides in SARSCoV2 in random order was used as a control Result PurUUpurU occurred 28 times more often in the actual SARSCoV2 genome than the randomized genome The number of purUUpurU motifs correlates with the severity of the acute illnesses caused by the RNA viruses examined, except for influenza A Conclusion Hyperactivation of TLR8 mediated inflammation by purUUpurU may cause pathological inflammation in COVID19 Marked elevations of TNFɑ, IL6, and fibrinogen will cause erythrocyte aggregation and increase blood viscosity This promotes thrombosis and decreases tissue perfusion Therapeutic plasmapheresis reduces blood hyperviscosity and should be used in severe COVID19 To date, use of this therapy has only been reported in COVID19 associated thrombosis,Severe eosinophilic asthma SEA has been associated with Thelper type 2 Th2 inflammatory response A good understanding of T cell functions in asthma is important for therapy, especially in the choice of biological treatments for severe cases Mepolizumab, an IL5 antagonist, is indicated for the treatment of severe asthma Regulatory T cells Tregs suppress inflammation by secreting cytokines that inhibit Th2 cell proliferation We investigated peripheral Treg, CD4, CD8, CD19 and NK cell percentages and their relationship to clinical and functional parameters, including peripheral eosinophils, before and after antiIL5 treatment Subjects were 14 adult SEA patients 9 male, 541xa0xa0116xa0years, treated with mepolizumab, and 10 controls T cells CD4 and CD8, CD19, NK and Tregs were evaluated by flow cytometry Comparison of lung function parameters before and after treatment with mepolizumab T0 and T1 showed an increase in FEV1, FEV1FVC ratio and a reduction in blood eosinophil percentages CD8 and CD1656 CD3 were significantly higher in SEA patients than controls Pxa0xa004 and Pxa0xa003, respectively A decrease in CD45, CD8xa0xa0and CD1656 CD3 cell percentages was observed between T0 and T1 Pxa0xa002, Pxa0xa004, Pxa0xa003, respectively A significant increase in Treg percentages Pxa0xa00001 was recorded between T0 and T1 Mepolizumab therapy was found to modulate immune response, restoring immune balance in patients with SEA,Background Since severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 first emerged, many articles have been published on airway management for coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 patients However, there is a lack of clear and concise conceptual framework for working with infected patients without respiratory failure undergoing general anaesthesia compared to noninfected patients The aim of this article is to review current literature data on new challenges for anaesthesia providers, compare standard airway management techniques protocols with new data, and discuss optimisation potentialMaterials and methods Literature search was performed in Google Scholar and PubMed databases using these keywords and their combinations anaesthesia, preoxygenation, airway management, difficult airway, SARSCoV2, COVID19 The following nonsystematic review is based on a comprehensive literature search of available data, wherein 41 articles were chosen for detailed analysis Summarised and analysed data are presented in the articleResultsxa0SARSCoV2 has unique implications for airway management techniques in patients without respiratory failure undergoing general anesthesia Main differences with the standard practice include institutional preparedness, team composition principles, necessary skills, equipment, drugs, intubation and extubation strategies Failed or difficult intubation is managed with predominance of emergency front of neck access FONA due to increased aerosol generationConclusionsxa0Airway management techniques in COVID19 patients without respiratory failure are more challenging than in noninfected patients undergoing general anaesthesia Safe, accurate and swift actions avoid unnecessary time delay ensuring the best care for patients, and reduce risk of contamination for staff Appropriate airway strategy, communication, minimisation of time for aerosol generating procedures and rampedup position aid to achieve these goals During the pandemic, updated available literature data may change clinical practice as new evidence emerges,The coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic has increased awareness that severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus2 SARSCoV2 may have profound effects on the cardiovascular system COVID19 often affects patients with preexisting cardiac disease, and may trigger acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS, venous thromboembolism VTE, acute myocardial infarction AMI, and acute heart failure AHF However, as COVID19 is primarily a respiratory infectious disease, there remain substantial uncertainty and controversy whether and how cardiovascular biomarkers should be used in patients with suspected COVID19 To help clinicians understand the possible value as well as the most appropriate interpretation of cardiovascular biomarkers in COVID19, it is important to highlight that recent findings regarding the prognostic role of cardiovascular biomarkers in patients hospitalized with COVID19 are similar to those obtained in studies for pneumonia and ARDS in general Cardiovascular biomarkers reflecting pathophysiological processes involved in COVID19pneumonia and its complications have a role evaluating disease severity, cardiac involvement, and risk of death in COVID19 as well as in pneumonias caused by other pathogens First, cardiomyocyte injury, as quantified by cardiac troponin concentrations, and haemodynamic cardiac stress, as quantified by natriuretic peptide concentrations, may occur in COVID19 as in other pneumonias The level of those biomarkers correlates with disease severity and mortality Interpretation of cardiac troponin and natriuretic peptide concentrations as quantitative variables may aid in risk stratification in COVID19pneumonia and also will ensure that these biomarkers maintain high diagnostic accuracy for AMI and AHF Second, activated coagulation as quantified by Ddimers seems more prominent in COVID19 as in other pneumonias Due to the central role of endothelitis and VTE in COVID19, serial measurements of Ddimers may help physicians in the selection of patients for VTE imaging and the intensification of the level of anticoagulation from prophylactic to slightly higher or even therapeutic doses,Iidiopathic pulmonary fibrosis IPF diagnosis and treatment during this COVID19 pandemic have been affected COVID19 has not only impacted the prognosis of these patients but also the approach to these patients Pulmonary function tests PFT and lung biopsies are less encouraged now Traditional antifibrotics used in IPF should be encouraged irrespective of patient lung function and in those with nondefinite usual interstitial pneumonia in high resolution computed tomography,OBJECTIVE The objective was to explore if chest Xray severity, assessed using a validated scoring system, predicts patient outcome on admission and when starting continuous positive pressure ventilation CPAP for COVID19 DESIGN The study was a retrospective casecontrolled study PARTICIPANTS There were 163 patients with COVID19 deemed candidates for CPAP on admission, including 58 who subsequently required CPAP OUTCOME MEASURES On admission, we measured the proportion of patients meeting a composite negative outcome of requiring CPAP, intubation or dying versus successful wardbased care For those escalated to CPAP, negative outcomes were intubation or death versus successful deescalation of respiratory support RESULTS Our results were stratified into tertiles, those with moderate or severe Xrays on admission had significantly higher odds of negative outcome versus mild odds ratio OR 232 95 confidence interval CI 11214803 p0023 and OR 3600 95 CI 16817708 p0001, respectively This could not be demonstrated in those commencing CPAP OR 0976 95 CI 07541264 p0856 CONCLUSIONS We outline a scoring system to stratify Xrays by severity and directly link this to prognosis However, we were unable to demonstrate this association in the patients commencing CPAP,,,The novel Coronavirus 2019nCoV first detected in Wuhan, China, is currently causing concern in the medical community as the virus is spreading and threatening the world including the Western cou,To the Editor,In a recent report in this journal, the lockdown in the EmiliaRomagna Region of Italy in March and April 2020 was found to be associated with a decrease of overrall antibiotic consum,,ABSTRACT  Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCov2induced infection, the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19, is characterized by unprecedented clinical pathologies One of the most important pathologies, is hypercoagulation and microclots in the lungs of patients Here we study the effect of isolated SARSCoV2 spike protein S1 subunit as potential inflammagen sui generis  Using scanning electron and fluorescence microscopy as well as mass spectrometry, we investigate the potential of this inflammagen to interact with platelets and fibrinogen directly to cause blood hypercoagulation Using platelet poor plasma PPP, we show that spike protein may interfere with blood flow Mass spectrometry also showed that when spike protein S1 is added to healthy PPP, it results in structural changes to β and γ fibrinogen, complement 3, and prothrombin These proteins were substantially resistant to trypsinization, in the presence of spike protein S1 Here we suggest that, in part, the presence of spike protein in circulation may contribute to the hypercoagulation in COVID19 positive patients and may cause substantial impairment of fibrinolysis Such lytic impairment may result in the persistent large microclots we have noted here and previously in plasma samples of COVID19 patients This observation may have important clinical relevance in the treatment of hypercoagulability in COVID19 patients,Purpose of ReviewThe purpose of this review is to summarize the application of cardiac magnetic resonance CMR in the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of patients with heart failure HFRecent FindingsCMR is an important noninvasive imaging modality in the assessment of ventricular volumes and function and in the analysis of myocardial tissue characteristics The information derived from CMR provides a comprehensive evaluation of HF Its unique ability of tissue characterization not only helps to reveal the underlying etiologies of HF but also offers incremental prognostic informationSummaryCMR is a useful noninvasive tool for the diagnosis and assessment of prognosis in patients suffering from heart failure,Social media allows interventional cardiologists to disseminate and discuss research and clinical cases in realtime, to demonstrate and learn innovative techniques, to build professional networks, and to reach out to patients and the general public Social media provides a democratic platform for all participants to influence the conversation and demonstrate their expertise This review addresses the use of social media for these purposes in interventional cardiology, as well as respect for patient privacy, how to get started on social media, the creation of highimpact social media content, and the role of traditional journals in the age of social media In the future, we hope that interventional cardiology fellowship programs will incorporate social media training into their curricula In addition, professional societies may adapt to the rapid dissemination of data on social media by developing processes to update guidelines more rapidly and more frequently,Woman admitted for COVID19 respiratory failure requiring intubation, renal failure and rising bilirubin, requiring CVVHD Due to dropping hemoglobin and platelets, TTP was suspected and empiric plasma exchange initiated Platelets normalized she improved ADAMTS13 level resulted 507, indicating possible benefit of plasma exchange for COVID19 thrombotic microangiopathy despite normal ADAMTS13,Opioid overdose is the leading cause of death for Americans 25 to 64 years of age, and opioid use disorder affects 2 million Americans The epidemiology of opioidassociated outofhospital cardiac arrest in the United States is changing rapidly, with exponential increases in death resulting from synthetic opioids and linear increases in heroin deaths more than offsetting modest reductions in deaths from prescription opioids The pathophysiology of polysubstance toxidromes involving opioids, asphyxial death, and prolonged hypoxemia leading to global ischemia cardiac arrest differs from that of sudden cardiac arrest People who use opioids may also develop bacteremia, central nervous system vasculitis and leukoencephalopathy, torsades de pointes, pulmonary vasculopathy, and pulmonary edema Emergency management of opioid poisoning requires recognition by the lay public or emergency dispatchers, prompt emergency response, and effective ventilation coupled to compressions in the setting of opioidassociated outofhospital cardiac arrest Effective ventilation is challenging to teach, whereas naloxone, an opioid antagonist, can be administered by emergency medical personnel, trained laypeople, and the general public with dispatcher instruction to prevent cardiac arrest Opioid education and naloxone distributions programs have been developed to teach people who are likely to encounter a person with opioid poisoning how to administer naloxone, deliver highquality compressions, and perform rescue breathing Current American Heart Association recommendations call for laypeople and others who cannot reliably establish the presence of a pulse to initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation in any individual who is unconscious and not breathing normally if opioid overdose is suspected, naloxone should also be administered Secondary prevention, including counseling, opioid overdose education with takehome naloxone, and medication for opioid use disorder, is important to prevent recurrent opioid overdose,Indigenous children and young peoples live with an inequitable burden of acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease In this Review, we focus on the epidemiological burden and lived experience of these conditions for Indigenous young peoples in Australia, New Zealand, and Canada We outline the direct and indirect drivers of rheumatic heart disease risk and their mitigation Specifically, we identify the opportunities and limitations of predominantly biomedical approaches to the primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention of disease among Indigenous peoples We explain why these biomedical approaches must be coupled with decolonising approaches to address the underlying cause of disease Initiatives underway to reduce acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease in Australia, New Zealand, and Canada are reviewed to identify how an Indigenous rightsbased approach could contribute to elimination of rheumatic heart disease and global disease control goals,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS‐CoV‐2, the pathogen of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID‐19, caused the outbreak escalated to pandemic Reports suggested that near 13 of COVID‐19 cases have a fatal outcome Angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors ACEIs and angiotensin receptor blockers ARBs are widely used in hypertension, heart failure and chronic kidney disease These drugs have been reported to upregulate angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ACE2 which produces Ang 17, the main counterregulatory mediator of angiotensin II This enzyme is also known as the receptor of SARS‐CoV‐2 promoting the cellular uptake of the virus in the airways, however, ACE2 itself proved to be protective in several experimental models of lung injury The present study aimed to systematically review the relationship between ACEIARB administration and ACE2 expression in experimental models After a comprehensive search and selection, 27 animal studies investigating ACE2 expression in the context of ACEI and ARB were identified The majority of these papers reported increased ACE2 levels in response to ACEIARB treatment This result should be interpreted in the light of the dual role of ACE2 being a promoter of viral entry to cells and a protective factor against oxidative damage in the lungs,Background and aim of the studyIn Germany, axa0constant demographic change is taking place, which leads to an increasing aging of the society The present study aimed to analyze natural deaths occurring at an age of u202f65xa0years, since health vulnerability in this age group is gaining importanceMaterial and methodsAutopsy reports of the Institute of Forensic Medicine, University Hospital of the Goethe University FrankfurtMain, Germany, were retrospectively evaluated regarding natural death cases of u202f65yearolds in axa0time comparison periodxa0I 20002002 periodxa0II 20132015ResultsDuring both periods, axa0total of 1206 autopsies concerning this age group were performed Among these, 404xa0cases 335 of unnatural death and 39xa0cases 32 of axa0combination of natural and unnatural death were recorded in 94xa0cases 78, the manner of death could not be elucidated The majority nu202fu2009669 555 included cases of natural death In the largest group of these nu202fu2009350 523, cardiac causes of death were predominant, followed by 132 197 respiratory and 47 70 abdominal causes of death In addition, 37 55 cases of malignant neoplasms, 33 49 of ruptures of large vessels, 33 49 of cerebral, and 37 55 other cases of natural death were noted Axa0significant decrease of cardiac causes of death was observed in the comparison of periodsxa0I andxa0II In particular, there was axa0significant decrease in highgrade occlusive coronary sclerosis Moreover, there were significant differences between both sexes Men had significantly more bypasses, stents and heart scars and suffered axa0myocardial infarction about 10 years earlier than womenConclusionThe results of the present study are largely consistent with the literature The decrease in numbers of cardiac deaths may be attributed to increasingly better medical care and to axa0significantly higher rate of stent implantation Especially in times of pandemics, the role of forensic gerontology will become more important,INTRODUCTION Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 has been associated with cardiac arrhythmias Several electrocardiographic markers have been used to predict the risk of arrhythmia in patients with COVID19 We aim to investigate the electrocardiographic ECG ventricular repolarization indices in patients with COVID19 METHODOLOGY We performed a comprehensive systematic literature search from PubMed, EuropePMC, SCOPUS, Cochrane Central Database, and Google Scholar Preprint Servers The primary endpoints of this search were Tpe TpeaktoTend interval, QTd QT dispersion, and TpeQTc ratio in patients with newly diagnosed COVID19 from inception up until August 2020 RESULTS There were a total of 241 patients from 2 studies Metaanalysis showed that TpeQTc ratio was higher in COVID19 group mean difference 002 001, 002, p  0001 I2 18, Tpe interval was more prolonged in COVID19 group mean difference 776 311, 1241, p  0001 I2 80 compared to control group QT dispersion QTd also was increased in COVID19 group mean difference 122 061, 183, p  0001  I230 CONCLUSIONS Several electrocardiographic markers including TpeQTc, Tpe interval, and QTd are significantly increased in patients with COVID19,Összefoglaló Számos közlemény született arról, hogy a COVID19pneumoniás betegek jelentős hányadában az artériás parciális oxigéntenzió kifejezetten alacsony, mégsem jellemző a dyspnoe, és a pulzusoximetria sem mutat  a csökkent oxigéntenzióval arányos  súlyos hypoxaemiát A jelenséget happy hypoxaemia néven említik Ugyanakkor a légszomjról nem panaszkodó, de súlyos alveolocapillaris O2felvételi zavarban szenvedő COVID19pneumoniás betegek a legkisebb fizikai megterhelést sem tűrik, és állapotuk gyorsan kritikussá válhat, tehát a hypoxaemia mértékének időben való felismerése kulcskérdés A jelen közleményben egy ilyen eset rövid ismertetése után összefoglaljuk a súlyos, de tünetmentes hypoxaemia hátterében meghúzódó élettani okokat Ezek között szerepel a hypocapnia respiratoricus alkalosis is, mely alacsony oxigéntenzió mellett is a hemoglobin viszonylag megtartott oxigénszaturációját eredményezi Ezért a mindennapi COVID19ellátásban a megismételt artériásvérgázmeghatározások jelentősége nem hangsúlyozható eléggé Orv Hetil 2021 16210 362365 Summary Many COVID19 patients have very low arterial partial oxigen tension while severe dyspnoe does not develop Pulse oxymetry indicates only moderate reduction of arterial O2 saturation in these patients The phenomenon is named happy hypoxaemia Lack of severe dyspnoe and only moderately decreased O2 saturation in severely impaired alveolocapillary O2 uptake may partially be explained by an increased oxygen affinity of hemoglobin in the presence of low arterial partial pressure of CO2 The latter results from increased alveolar ventilation, while low partial pressure of O2 in COVID19 patients reflects righttoleft shunting of pulmonary blood flow and ventilationperfusion mismatch of the diseased lungs While such patients may have mild complaints as related to the real impairment of alveolocapillary oxygen exchange, severe hypoxaemia is a negative prognostic factor of outcome in this state where severe clinical deterioration may rapidly appear The latter circumstance together with the unusual relationship of O2 partial pressure and O2 saturation of hemoglobin in COVID19 emphasize the importance of repeated complete arterial blood gas analyses in these patients Orv Hetil 2021 16210 362365,BACKGROUND Cardiovascular disease CVD hospitalizations declined worldwide during the COVID19 pandemic It is unclear how shelterinplace orders affected acute CVD hospitalizations, illness severity, and outcomes HYPOTHESIS COVID19 pandemic was associated with reduced acute CVD hospitalizations heart failure HF, acute coronary syndrome ACS, and stroke CVA, and worse HF illness severity METHODS We compared acute CVD hospitalizations at Duke University Health System before and after North Carolinas shelterinplace order January 1March 29 vs March 30August 31, and used parallel comparison cohorts from 2019 We explored illness severity among admitted HF patients using ADHERE high risk 2 points and GWTGHF 10 57 points inhospital mortality risk scores, as well as echocardiographyderived parameters RESULTS Comparing hospitalizations during January 1March 29 N  1618 vs March 30August 31 N  2501 in 2020, mean daily CVD hospitalizations decreased 182 vs 161 per day, p  0036, with decreased length of stay 84 vs 75u2009days, p  0081 and no change in inhospital mortality 47 vs 53, p  41 HF hospitalizations decreased 90 vs 77 per day, p  0019, with higher ADHERE high risk 25 vs 45 p  030, but unchanged GWTGHF 10 53 vs 46 p  45, risk groups Mean LVEF was lower 390 vs 372, p  034, with higher mean LV mass 2624 vs 2766u2009g, p  014 CONCLUSIONS CVD hospitalizations, HF illness severity, and echocardiography measures did not change between admission periods in 2019 Evaluating shortterm data, the COVID19 shelterinplace order was associated with reductions in acute CVD hospitalizations, particularly HF, with no significant increase in inhospital mortality and only minor differences in HF illness severity,,,BACKGROUND AIMS Around 50u2006000 autologous stem cell transplantations are done each year worldwide using cryopreserved peripheral blood stem cells PBSCs Cryopreservation is timeconsuming and expensive Since 2007, several retrospective studies have shown that PBSCs can be stored at 4°C for 23 days, allowing autologous stem cell transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma receiving highdose melphalan Data with noncryopreserved PBSCs in patients autografted for lymphoma following longer preconditioning regimens are limited In addition, no controlled comparison has been able to detect unforeseen differences METHODS The authors compared outcomes of 94 consecutive adult patients with lymphoma 66 with Hodgkin lymphoma autografted in our department in Oran Algeria using PBSCs stored at 4°C, from 2009 to 2018, with patients receiving cryopreserved stem cells reported to the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry Patients autografted in Oran were matched with patients receiving cryopreserved PBSCs in the registry four controls per patient in Oran RESULTS Neutrophil engraftment was significantly faster with cryopreserved PBSCs Pxa0xa00003 By day 10, only 17 of patients receiving noncryopreserved PBSCs engrafted versus 48 for cryopreserved PBSCs Likewise, platelet recovery to 20 000mm3 was significantly faster in patients receiving cryopreserved PBSCs Pxa0xa0001 However, all patients in both groups had recovered by day 20 There were no significant differences in nonrelapse mortality 9 versus 7, Pxa0xa004, relapse incidence 22 versus 32, Pxa0xa0013, progressionfree survival 70 versus 61, Pxa0xa004 or overall survival 85 versus 75, Pxa0xa003 CONCLUSIONS This analysis suggests that, in patients with lymphoma receiving pretransplant regimens such as carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine and melphalan, PBSCs stored at 4°C for up to 6 days can be used safely in centers with no cryopreservation facility However, the kinetics of hematopoietic recovery showed a significant, albeit small, delay in engraftment for both neutrophils and platelets, which favors the use of cryopreservation if available,BACKGROUND Strict countermeasures for coronavirus disease COVID19 were undertaken in China without knowing their influence on asthma OBJECTIVE To investigate the associations between the frequencies of asthma exacerbations and respiratory infections and air pollutants before and during the COVID19 pandemic, which were direct consequences of countermeasures undertaken for the pandemic METHODS Asthma exacerbations and respiratory infections among hospitalized children in the permanent population of Guangzhou City, China, from February to June 20162019 before the pandemic to February to June 2020 during the pandemic were collected in this crosssectional study in Guangzhou RESULTS The number of asthma exacerbation cases per month documented in the Guangzhou Women and Childrens Hospital before median 135 range 048 and during median 20 range 034 the mitigative response to the COVID19 pandemic was similar The frequency of severe asthma exacerbation cases per month decreased, whereas that of mild asthma exacerbation cases per year increased pu2009u2009004 The number of patients hospitalized with infectious respiratory diseases decreased from 146 range 90172 per month before the pandemic to 42 range 3357 per month during the pandemic pu2009u2009004 Most pathogens and air pollutants decreased during the COVID19 pandemic The frequency of severe asthma exacerbations positively correlated to that of respiratory infections in children, but did not correlate to air pollutants CONCLUSION Strict countermeasures undertaken for the pandemic were associated with a decreased the frequency of infectious respiratory diseases and severe asthma exacerbations among urban children,Endotoxininduced lung injury is one of the major causes of death induced by endotoxemia, however, few effective therapeutic options exist Hydrogen inhalation has recently been shown to be an effective treatment for inflammatory lung injury, but the underlying mechanism is unknown In the current study we aim to investigate how hydrogen attenuates endotoxininduced lung injury and provide reference values for the clinical application of hydrogen LPS was used to establish an endotoxininduced lung injury mouse model The survival rate and pulmonary pathologic changes were evaluated THP1 and HUVECC cells were cultured in vitro The thioredoxin 1 Trx1 inhibitor was used to evaluate the antiinflammatory effects of hydrogen Hydrogen significantly improved the survival rate of mice, reduced pulmonary edema and hemorrhage, infiltration of neutrophils, and IL6 secretion Inhalation of hydrogen decreased tissue factor TF expression and MMP9 activity, while Trx1 expression was increased in the lungs and serum of endotoxemia mice LPSstimulated THP1 and HUVECC cells in vitro and showed that hydrogen decreases TF expression and MMP9 activity, which were abolished by the Trx1 inhibitor, PX12 Hydrogen attenuates endotoxininduced lung injury by decreasing TF expression and MMP9 activity via activating Trx1 Targeting Trx1 by hydrogen may be a potential treatment for endotoxininduced lung injury,An individuals experience of COPD is determined by many factors in addition to the pathological features of chronic bronchitis and emphysema and the symptoms that derive directly from them Multimorbidity is the norm rather than the exception, so most people with COPD are living with a range of other medical problems which can decrease overall quality of life COPD is caused by the inhalation of noxious particles or gases, in particular tobacco smoke, but also by early life disadvantage impairing lung development and by occupations where inhaled exposures are common eg industrial, farming and cleaning work Wealthy people are therefore relatively protected from developing COPD and people who do develop the condition may have reduced resources to cope COPD is also no longer a condition that predominantly affects men The prevalence of COPD among women has equalled that of men since 2008 in many high‐income countries, due to increased exposure to tobacco, and in low‐income countries due to biomass fuels COPD is one of the leading causes of death in women in the USA, and death rates attributed to COPD in women in some countries are predicted to overtake those of men in the next decade Many factors contribute to this phenomenon, but in addition to socioeconomic and occupational factors, there is increasing evidence of a higher susceptibility of females to smoking and pollutants Quality of life is also more significantly impaired in women Although most medications bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids used to treat COPD demonstrate similar trends for exacerbation prevention and lung function improvement in men and women, this is an understudied area and clinical trials frequently have a preponderance of males A better understanding of gender‐based predictors of efficacy of all therapeutic interventions is crucial for comprehensive patient care There is an urgent need to recognize the increasing burden of COPD in women and to facilitate global improvements in disease prevention and management in this specific population Many individuals with COPD follow a trajectory of both lung function decline and also multimorbidity Unfavourable lung function trajectories throughout life have implications for later development of other chronic diseases An enhanced understanding of the temporal associations underlying the development of coexisting diseases is a crucial first step in unravelling potential common disease pathways Lessons can be learned from exploring disease trajectories of other NCD as well as multimorbidity development Further research will be essential to explain how early life risk factors commonly influence trajectories of COPD and other diseases, how different diseases develop in relation to each other in a temporal way and how this ultimately leads to different multimorbidity patterns in COPD This review integrates new knowledge and ideas pertaining to three broad themes i the overall burden of disease in COPD, ii an unappreciated high burden in women and iii the contrast of COPD trajectories and different multimorbidity patterns with trajectories of other NCD The underlying pathology of COPD is largely irreversible, but many factors noted in the review are potentially amenable to intervention Health and social care systems need to ensure that effective treatment is accessible to all people with the condition Preventive strategies and treatments that alter the course of disease are crucial, particularly for patients with COPD as one of many problems,Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis IPF is an interstitial disease of unknown etiology characterized by progressive pulmonary fibrosis Pirfenidone and nintedanib are the only drugs that can prolong the time to disease progression, slow down the decline in lung function, and prolong survival However, they do not offer a cure and are associated with tolerability issues The pluripotency of mesenchymal stem cells MSCs and their ability to regulate immunity, inhibit inflammation, and promote epithelial tissue repair highlight the promise of MSC therapy for treating interstitial lung disease However, optimal protocols are lacking for multiparameter selection in MSC therapy This review summarizes preclinical studies on MSC transplantation for the treatment of interstitial lung disease and clinical studies with known results An analysis of relevant factors for the optimization of treatment plans is presented, including MSCs with different sources, administration routes and timing, dosages, frequencies, and pretreatments with MSCs This review proposes an optimized plan for guiding the design of future clinical research to identify therapeutic options for this complex disease,During an epidemic period, we compared patients hospitalized for initial suspicion of COVID19 but for whom an alternative diagnosis was finally retained n  152 with those who had COVID19 n  222 Most common diagnoses were another infectious disease and heart failure COVID19negative patients were more often active smokers had less often cough, fever, and digestive symptoms, as compared to the 222 COVID19positive patients They had higher median neutrophil and lymphocyte counts and lower CRP level In multivariate analysis, no current smoking, neurocognitive disorder, myalgia, and fibrinogen 4gL were independently associated with a final diagnosis of COVID19,In the present COVID19 pandemic situation, there is a gradual increase in number of patients with postCOVID19 sequalae The present study is a retrospective analysis of these postCOVID19 patients presenting to one of the units of Viswanathan Chest Hospital, Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute, University of Delhi, Delhi in the period from 17 June 2020 to 22 October 2020 We analysed the demographic profile, history, functional assessment and all investigations of this study cohort Out of the 2,165 patients provided consultation, there were 35 patients of postCOVID19, which were included in the present study These patients had a mean duration of 47 days from discharge to first visit to our hospital Preexisting respiratory comorbidity was present in 63 History of hospitalisation was present in 52 Fatigue 65 was the most common symptom followed by breathlessness 60, cough 4571 and chest pain 2857 Three patients had significant desaturation on 6minute walk test and one patient had type 2 respiratory failure on presentation Chest Xray was abnormal in 3428 n12 On CT thorax n17 the most common finding was diffuse reticulations 5294 followed by diffuse ground glass opacities GGOs 3529 One patient each were newly diagnosed as pulmonary tuberculosis and tubercular unilateral hilar lymphadenopathy Conclusively, postCOVID19 patients may have remnant symptoms like fatigue, breathlessness and cough Also, patients with preexisting respiratory diseases are more symptomatic and even may suffer from deterioration in the clinical course Further we need to be alert of alternate diagnosis or infections like tuberculosis TB in these patients, especially in TB endemic countries like India Simultaneously, the use of immunosuppressant drugs like steroids for COVID19 management, predisposes to TB A proper evaluation with holistic and standardised management plan is the need of the hour for postCOVID19 patients, until its time course, evolution and manifestations are unravelled,BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 disproportionately affects older people Observational studies suggest indolent cardiovascular involvement after recovery from acute COVID19 However, these findings may reflect preexisting cardiac phenotypesAimsWe tested the association of baseline cardiovascular magnetic resonance CMR phenotypes with incident COVID19MethodsWe studied UK Biobank participants with CMR imaging and COVID19 testing We considered left and right ventricular LV, RV volumes, ejection fractions, and stroke volumes, LV mass, LV strain, native T1, aortic distensibility, and arterial stiffness index COVID19 test results were obtained from Public Health England Comorbidities were ascertained from selfreport and hospital episode statistics HES Critical care admission and death were from HES and death register records We investigatedxa0the association of each cardiovascular measure with COVID19 test result in multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, body mass index, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, and prior myocardial infarctionResultsWe studied 310 participants nu2009u200970 positive Median age was 638 575, 721 years 510 nu2009u2009158 were male 787 nu2009u2009244 were tested in hospital, 35 nu2009u200911 required critical care admission, and 61 nu2009u200919 died In fully adjusted models, smaller LVRV enddiastolic volumes, smaller LV stroke volume, and poorer global longitudinal strain were associated with significantly higher odds of COVID19 positivityDiscussionWe demonstrate association of preexisting adverse CMR phenotypes with greater odds of COVID19 positivity independent of classical cardiovascular risk factorsConclusionsObservational reports of cardiovascular involvement after COVID19 may, at least partly, reflect preexisting cardiac status rather than COVID19 induced alterations,An association of various blood types and the 2019 novel coronavirus disease COVID19 has been found in a number of publications The aim of this literature review is to summarize key findings related to ABO blood types and COVID19 infection rate, symptom presentation, and outcome Summarized findings include associations between ABO blood type and higher infection susceptibility, intubation duration, and severe outcomes, including death The literature suggests that blood type O may serve as a protective factor, as individuals with blood type O are found COVID19 positive at far lower rates This could suggest that blood type O individuals are less susceptible to infection, or that they are asymptomatic at higher rates and therefore do not seek out testing We also discuss genetic associations and potential molecular mechanisms that drive the relationship between blood type and COVID19 Studies have found a strong association between a locus on a specific gene cluster on chromosome three chr3p2131 and outcome severity, such as respiratory failure Cellular models have suggested an explanation for blood type modulation of infection, evidencing that spike proteinAngiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2dependent adhesion to ACE2expressing cell lines was specifically inhibited by monoclonal or natural human antiA antibodies, so individuals with nonA blood types, specifically O, or B blood types, which produce antiA antibodies, may be less susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 infection due to the inhibitory effects of antiA antibodies,AIMS Patients with adult congenital heart disease ACHD are a potentially vulnerable patient cohort in case of COVID19 Some cardiac defects may be associated with a poor COVID19 outcome Risk estimation in ACHD is currently based on expert opinion The aim of this study was to collect clinical outcome data and to identify risk factors for a complicated course of COVID19 in patients with ACHD METHODS Twentyfive ACHD centres in nine European countries participated in the study Consecutive patients with ACHD diagnosed with COVID19 presenting to one of the participating centres between 27 March and 6 June 2020 were included A complicated disease course was defined as hospitalisation for COVID19 requiring noninvasive or invasive ventilation andor inotropic support, or a fatal outcome RESULTS Of 105 patients with a mean age of 3813 years 58 women, 13 had a complicated disease course, of whom 5 died In univariable analysis, age OR 13, 95u2009CI 11 to 17, per 5 years, 2 comorbidities OR 71, 95u2009CI 21 to 245, body mass index of 25u2009kgm2 OR 72, 95u2009CI 19 to 283 and cyanotic heart disease OR 132, 95u2009CI 25 to 684 were associated with a complicated disease course In a multivariable logistic regression model, cyanotic heart disease was the most important predictor OR 600, 95u2009CI 76 to 4740 CONCLUSIONS Among patients with ACHD, general risk factors age, obesity and multiple comorbidities are associated with an increased risk of complicated COVID19 course Congenital cardiac defects at particularly high risk were cyanotic lesions, including unrepaired cyanotic defects or Eisenmenger syndrome,Although rare, children with active coronavirus disease 2019 are at risk of developing malignant arrhythmia Herein, we present the first paediatric case of refractory ventricular tachycardia from acute fulminant myocarditis secondary to acute COVID19 infection This 5yearold boy required venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, but made a complete recovery without significant morbidity,BACKGROUND It has been suggested that COVID19associated severe respiratory failure CARDS might differ from usual acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS due to failing autoregulation of pulmonary vessels and higher shunt We sought to investigate pulmonary hemodynamics and ventilation properties in patients with CARDS compared to patients with ARDS of pulmonary origin METHODS This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from consecutive adults with laboratoryconfirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 patients treated in our ICU in 042020 and a comparison of the data to matched controls with ARDS due to respiratory infections treated in our ICU from 012014 to 082019 for whom pulmonary artery catheter data were available RESULTS CARDS patients n  10 had ventilation characteristics similar to those of ARDS n  10 patients Nevertheless, mechanical power applied by ventilation was significantly higher in CARDS patients 234  89 Jmin than in ARDS 159  43 Jmin P  005 COVID19 patients had similar pulmonary artery pressure but significantly lower pulmonary vascular resistance, as cardiac output was higher in CARDS vs ARDS patients P  005 Shunt fraction and dead space were similar in CARDS compared to ARDS P  005 and were correlated with hypoxemia in both groups The arteriovenous pCO2 difference ▵pCO2 was elevated CARDS 55  28 mmHg vs ARDS 47  11 mmHg P  005, as was the PvaCO2CavO2 ratio CARDS mean 22  15 vs ARDS 17  08 P  005 CONCLUSIONS Respiratory failure in COVID19 patients seems to differ only slightly from ARDS regarding ventilation characteristics and pulmonary hemodynamics Our data indicate microcirculatory dysfunction More data need to be collected to assure these findings and gain more pathophysiological insights into COVID19 and respiratory failure,,,,A 35yearold nurse, who was 27 weeks pregnant at the time, was admitted to hospital with a short history of cough, fever and worsening shortness of breath Oral and nasopharyngeal swabs were positive for SARSCoV2 on realtime viral PCR During her admission, her breathing further deteriorated and she developed type 1 respiratory failure A decision was made to trial treatment with continuous positive airway pressure CPAP as a means of avoiding intubation The patient tolerated this well and made rapid improvements on this therapy She was quickly weaned off and fully recovered before being discharged home This case highlights the potential for CPAP to be used as a means of avoiding mechanical ventilation and iatrogenic preterm birth in COVID19 pneumonia in pregnancy Furthermore, it highlights the need for robust evidence to support this treatment,ObjectivesThe objective of this trial is to assess whether

produced in response to the presence of pathogens in cells and are responsible for the proper formation of immune reaction Preliminary data obtained in studies of properties of recombinant interferon gamma IFNγ that involved patients with communityacquired pneumonia including bacterial, acute respiratory viral infection ARVI, influenza and new coronavirus infection have shown promising resultsThe purpose of the study was to assess the effect of subcutaneous administration of IFNγ in patients with viral pneumonia on the changes of vital signs and the duration of hospital stay MATERIAL AND METHODS An openlabel, randomized, lowinterventional study included patients with moderate new coronavirus infection COVID19 over 18 years of age of both sexes IFNγ 500,000 IU was administered sc, daily, once a day, during 5 days RESULTS IFNy in addition to complex therapy of the disease resulted in more favorable changes in the stabilization of vital signs, as well as in reduced length of fever and hospital stay by 2 days what allows suggesting a positive effect of this substance on the recovery processes in patients with moderate COVID19 Special emphasis should be made to the fact that patients who received recombinant IFN γ experienced no progression of respiratory failure and required no transfer to intensive care unit DISCUSSION This study confirms earlier obtained data on the positive effect of IFNy on the rate of clinical stabilization and recovery of patients with communityacquired pneumonia and viral infections Presented results are limited to a small number of patients further study of drug properties in postmarketing studies is required CONCLUSION Progress in the treatment of patients with moderate COVID19 by adding recombinant IFNγ to the complex therapy may reasonably expand the range of existing treatment options for this infection,BACKGROUND During the COVID19 pandemic, the use of protection masks is essential to reduce contagions However, public opinion reports an associated subjective shortness of breath We evaluated cardiorespiratory parameters at rest and during maximal exertion to highlight any differences with the use of protection masks METHODS Twelve healthy subjects underwent three cardiopulmonary exercise tests without wearing protection mask, with surgical and with FFP2 mask Dyspnea was assessed by Borg Scale Standard pulmonary function tests were also performed RESULTS All the subjects 408124u2005years 6 males completed the protocol with no adverse event At spirometry, from no mask to surgical to FFP2, a progressive reduction of FEV1 and FVC was observed 394091u2005l, 323081u2005l, 294098u2005l and 470121u2005l, 377102u2005l, 352121u2005l, respectively, p0001 Rest ventilation, O2 uptake V̇O2 and CO2 production VCO2 were progressively lower with a reduction of respiratory rate At peak exercise, subjects revealed a progressively higher Borg scale when wearing surgical and FFP2 Accordingly, at peak exercise, V̇O2 310234, 27569, 28288u2005mlkgmin, p0001, ventilation 9226, 7622, 7221u2005l, p0003, respiratory rate 428, 385, 374, p004 and tidal volume 228072, 205060, 196065u2005l, p0001 were gradually lower We did not observed a significant difference in oxygen saturation CONCLUSIONS Protection masks are associated with significant but modest worsening of spirometry and cardiorespiratory parameters at rest and peak exercise The effect is driven by a ventilation reduction due to an increased airflow resistance However, since exercise ventilatory limitation is far from being reached, their use is safe even during maximal exercise, with a slight reduction in performance,The coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic has resulted in over 105 million confirmed cases and over 23 million deaths globally as of February 3, 2021 Cardiovascular problems due to COVID19 infection include acute coronary syndrome due to coronary occlusion, thrombosis, myocardial damage without coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, heart failure, pericardial effusion, and thromboembolic eventsxa0A 62yearold male patient was admitted to our emergency department with a complaint of chest pain radiating to his back The patient had a history of hospitalization for seven days in the outpatient clinic and 10 days in the intensive care unit due to COVID19 infection with severe lung involvement In contrastenhanced thoracoabdominal CT, a dissection line starting from the ascending aorta and progressing to the iliac bifurcation was observed Ascending aorta and transverse arch replacement was performed with a 30mm polytetrafluoroethylene tube graft The patient was discharged home 15 days postoperatively,Anticoagulant drugs have been used to prevent and treat thrombosis However, they are associated with risk of hemorrhage Therefore, prior to their clinical use, it is important to assess the risk of bleeding and thrombosis In case of older anticoagulant drugs like heparin and warfarin, dose adjustment is required owing to narrow therapeutic ranges The established monitoring methods for heparin and warfarin are activated partial thromboplastin time APTTantiXa assay and prothrombin time  international normalized ratio PTINR, respectively Since 2008, new generation anticoagulant drugs, called direct oral anticoagulants DOACs, have been widely prescribed to prevent and treat several thromboembolic diseases Although the use of DOACs without routine monitoring and frequent dose adjustment has been shown to be safe and effective, there may be clinical circumstances in specific patients when measurement of the anticoagulant effects of DOACs is required Recently, anticoagulation therapy has received attention when treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of anticoagulant drugs—heparin, warfarin, and DOACs and describe the methods used for the measurement of their effects In addition, we discuss the latest findings on thrombosis mechanism in patients with COVID19 with respect to biological chemistry,BACKGROUND Empagliflozin reduces the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease We sought to elucidate the effect of empagliflozin as an addon therapy on decongestion and renal function in patients with type 2 diabetes admitted for acute decompensated heart failure METHODS The study was terminated early due to COVID19 pandemic We enrolled 59 consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes admitted for acute decompensated heart failure Patients were randomly assigned to receive either empagliflozin addon n30 or conventional glucoselowering therapy n29 We performed laboratory tests at baseline and 1, 2, 3, and 7 days after randomization Percent change in plasma volume between admission and subsequent time points was calculated using the Strauss formula RESULTS There were no significant baseline differences in left ventricular ejection fraction and serum NTproBNP Nterminal proBtype natriuretic peptide, hematocrit, or serum creatinine levels between the 2 groups Seven days after randomization, NTproBNP level was significantly lower in the empagliflozin group than in the conventional group P0040, and hemoconcentration 3 absolute increase in hematocrit was more frequently observed in the empagliflozin group than in the conventional group P0020 The decrease in percent change in plasma volume between baseline and subsequent time points was significantly larger in the empagliflozin group than in the conventional group 7 days after randomization P0017 The incidence of worsening renal function an increase in serum creatinine 03 mgdL did not significantly differ between the 2 groups CONCLUSIONS In this exploratory analysis, empagliflozin achieved effective decongestion without an increased risk of worsening renal function as an addon therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes with acute decompensated heart failure REGISTRATION URL httpswwwuminacjpctrindexhtm Unique identifier UMIN000026315,PURPOSE Maximally decreasing portal pressures with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt TIPS is associated with improved ascites control but also increased encephalopathy incidence Since splenic venous flow contributes to portal hypertension, we assessed if combining smalldiameter TIPS with splenic artery embolization could improve ascites while minimizing encephalopathy METHODS Fiftyfive patients underwent TIPS creation for refractory ascites Subjects underwent creation of 8 mm TIPS followed by proximal splenic artery embolization group A, n8, or of 8 mm group B, n6 or 10 mm TIPS group C, n41 without splenic embolization Data were retrospectively reviewed RESULTS In group A, median portosystemic gradient decreased from 19 mmHg to 9 mmHg after TIPS, and 8 mmHg after subsequent splenic artery embolization In groups B and C, gradient decreased from 15 mmHg to 8 mmHg and 16 mmHg to 6 mmHg All patients except for one in group A and two in C had greater than 50 reduction in the number of paracenteses in 3 months Any postprocedural encephalopathy incidence was 62, 50, 83 in groups A, B, and C, respectively Overall, 20 of subjects with 10 mm TIPS required TIPS reductionclosure compared to 7 of subjects with 8 mm TIPS CONCLUSION We found that 8 mm diameter TIPS provided similar ascites control compared to 10 mm TIPS regardless of splenic embolization While more patients with 10 mm TIPS required reductionclosure for severe encephalopathy, the study was underpowered for definitive assessment Splenic embolization might have the potential to further decrease portosystemic gradient and ascites as an alternative to dilation of TIPS to 10 mm minimizing the risk of encephalopathy, but larger studies are warranted,Face masks prevent transmission of infectious respiratory diseases by blocking large droplets and aerosols during exhalation or inhalation While threelayer masks are generally advised, many commonly available or makeshift masks contain single or double layers Using carefully designed experiments involving highspeed imaging along with physicsbased analysis, we show that highmomentum, largesized 250 micrometer surrogate cough droplets can penetrate single or doublelayer mask material to a significant extent The penetrated droplets can atomize into numerous much smaller 100 micrometer droplets, which could remain airborne for a significant time The possibility of secondary atomization of highmomentum cough droplets by hydrodynamic focusing and extrusion through the microscale pores in the fibrous network of the singledoublelayer mask material needs to be considered in determining mask efficacy Threelayer masks can effectively block these droplets and thus could be ubiquitously used as a key tool against COVID19 or similar respiratory diseases,In March 2020, a 64yearold female with mitral valve insufficiency and persistent atrial fibrillation underwent preoperative noninvasive mapping for developing an ablation strategy In the computed tomography CT scan, typical signs of COVID19 were described Since the consecutive polymerase chain reaction PCR test was negative, the severely symptomatic patient was planned for urgent surgery Noninvasive mapping showed that atrial fibrillation was maintained by left atrial structures and pulmonary veins only On admission day, the preoperative routine COVID19 PCR test was positive, and after recovery, uneventful mitral valve repair with cryoablation of the left atrium and pulmonary veins was performed Our case describes the potential benefit of preoperative noninvasive mapping for the development of a surgical ablation strategy, as well as the challenges in managing urgent surgical patients during the COVID19 pandemic and the corresponding diagnostic relevance of CT,The year 2020 has been dominated by a communicable disease which most did not see coming and are ill prepared to handle While daily headlines the world over are dominated by new cases and death from COVID19, other major health issues must not take a back seat As of 30thNovember this year, 357 people have died of COVID19 in Malaysia,while close to 15,000 Malaysians died of Ischemic Heart Disease IHD alone With IHD and cerebrovascular accident CVA being the number 1 and number 3 causes of death 15 and 8 of all death, respectively our focus on COVID19 must not distract us from the elephant in the room Evidence from UK showed that while hospitalization due to acute myocardial infarction AMI has significantly decreased by 50, out of hospital cardiac arrest has significantly increased by 56 and in hospital mortality from AMI has increased by at least 35 during the pandemic Patients are shying away from coming for scheduled follow ups, and there has been a reduction in guideline recommended care for NCD This is confounded by early scare which suggested that treatment of risk factors for NCDs, especially for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes, may increase susceptibility to and worsen prognosis for patients with COVID19 Since COVID19 is a new entity, latest evidence generated are mainly from observational studies with few clinical trials with the exception of vaccine trials What do we know about management of NCD in the COVIDeraSince the discovery that SARSCOV2 virus attached itself to the ACE2 receptors before entering cells, alarm bells were sounded that patients treated with RAAS inhibitors may be susceptible to and have worse prognosis Withup to 60 of hypertensiveworldwide taking this class of drugs, the concern is understandable Reassuringly, 6 observational studies from 4 countries and 1 RCT from a 5th country showed this not to be true Studies from China and Italy showed that those on RAAS inhibitors have better prognosis and this has triggered an RCT which hypothesized that pretreatment with angiotensin receptor blockers may be beneficial in preventing pulmonary damage in these patients Another RCT is looking at recombinant human ACE2 as treatment for patients with COVID19 In diabetic patients, an observational study from New York showed those on statin has reduced mortality compared to nonuser and in a large UK based primary care setting there was no increased risk of COVID19 among patients prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors The SGLT2 inhibitors have been proven to improve clinical outcome including mortality in diabetics and could be safely used to treat patients during the pandemic Based on a nationwide retrospective cohort in the UK, overall mortality was higher for diabetics admitted to ICU or HDU and with greatest mortality impact in younger patientsThe next few months will see more prospective intervention studies publishedaddressing the various unanswered questions It is worth remembering that substandard care is responsible for upto 84 of CV death Hence, we shouldnot let our guards down with NCDs even when the worlds attention is focused on COVID19International Journal of Human and Health Sciencesxa0Supplementary Issue 2021 Page S10,Purpose of ReviewThe world is currently facing the largest global health crisis since the early 1900s due to a novel coronavirus While SARSCoV2 infection causes predictable symptoms in COVID19 patients, including upper respiratory distress and fever, the heterogeneity of manifestations is surprising This review focuses on direct and indirect causes of myocardial injury in COVID19 patients and highlights current knowledge, treatment strategies, and outstanding questions in the fieldRecent FindingsData are emerging that highlight the extent of cardiovascular involvement in COVID19 patients, including evidence that SARSCoV2 causes myocarditis and increases cardiac risk The incidence of cardiac injury is much greater in patients with severe disease presentation and those in intensive careSummaryDuring the past year, COVID19 patient mortality rates have improved due to tailored pharmacological treatments and patient management strategies that address the unique presentation of symptoms, which will hopefully also reduce the incidence of cardiac injury,PURPOSE Normal endothelial function is important for the homeostasis of the cardiovascular CV system The aim of the present study was to determine the profile of key parameters of endothelial dysfunction in middleaged men that play a significant role in the functioning of endothelial vessels, which seems to be crucial for the early diagnosis of cardiovascular disorders MATERIALS AND METHODS The study included 53 men, 20 with hypertension HTN, 18 with HTN and related diseases, 15 healthy controls Apart from general testing BMI, biochemical analysis, SBP, DBP, we used the Griess reaction to assess the total amount of nitric oxide NO, and used ELISA to verify the concentrations of malondialdehyde MDA, nitrotyrosine NT, asymmetric dimethylarginine ADMA, tumor necrosis factoralpha TNFα, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 MCP1, and myeloperoxidase MPO Furthermore, we assessed the concentration of circulating free DNA cfDNA using the fluorescence method RESULTS The values of MDA, ADMA, cfDNA, and MPO observed in samples from men with HTN were determined to be higher compared to those from men without HTN In the group of men with HTN and other concomitant cardiovascular disorders, we observed low concentrations of NO, MDA, and ADMA with high concentrations of cfDNA CONCLUSIONS The results obtained for parameters selected for the study, should be considered by cardiologists as a prompt to include in the diagnostic profile the assessment of NO and cfDNA concentrations for risk evaluation andor diagnosis of endothelial dysfunction in patients suffering from HTN or related complications,BACKGROUND Retrospective studies indicate that more cystic fibrosis CF pulmonary exacerbations PEx are treated with oral PO than with intravenous IV antimicrobials despite little knowledge of the relative effects of PO treatment on lung function recovery or longterm impacts on lung disease progression Previous studies have suggested that PO treatment may be associated with slower lung function recovery compared with IV treatment We used longitudinal home spirometry data from the eICE study NCT01104402 to compare PO versus IV antimicrobial treatment responses for PEx diagnosed by home spirometry and symptom assessment METHODS Adolescent and adult eICE participants performed home spirometry twice weekly for one year PEx were diagnosed by a protocoldefined algorithm of change in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second ppFEV1 andor respiratory signs and symptoms PO and IVtreated PEx were grouped by initial ppFEV1 drop magnitude Group ppFEV1 treatment responses were modeled with multivariate, repeatmeasure linear regression RESULTS Of 87 qualifying PEx from 56 participants, 62 were POtreated and 25 were IVtreated The average drop from best ppFEV1 to PEx start was 110 95CI 85, 135 with similar treatment group means p072 Participants with IVtreated PEx averaged 072 024, 120 ppFEV1day greater response than those treated with PO, who experienced minimal ppFEV1 recovery Many POtreated participants who had 10 ppFEV1 drop from baseline tended to worsen or show no ppFEV1 improvement DISCUSSION These results suggest that, in this cohort, PO antimicrobial treatment of CF PEx were less effective than IVs at improving ppFEV1 during treatment,Purpose of ReviewAlthough ecigarettes have become popular, especially among youth, the health effects associated with ecigarette use remain unclear This review discusses current evidence relating to the cardiovascular, pulmonary, and immunological effects of ecigarettesRecent FindingsThe use of ecigarettes by healthy adults has been shown to increase blood pressure, heart rate, and arterial stiffness, as well as resistance to air flow in lungs Inhalation of ecigarette aerosol has been shown to elicit immune responses and increase the production of immunomodulatory cytokines in young tobacconaïve individuals In animal models, longterm exposure to ecigarettes leads to marked changes in lung architecture, dysregulation of immune genes, and lowgrade inflammation Exposure to ecigarette aerosols in mice has been shown to induce DNA damage, inhibit DNA repair, and promote carcinogenesis Chronic exposure to ecigarettes has also been reported to result in the accumulation of lipidladen macrophages in the lung and dysregulation of lipid metabolism and transport in mice Although, the genotoxic and inflammatory effects of ecigarettes are milder than those of combustible cigarettes, some of the cardiorespiratory effects of the two insults are comparable The toxicity of ecigarettes has been variably linked to nicotine, as well as other ecigarette constituents, operating conditions, and use patternsSummaryThe use of ecigarettes in humans is associated with significant adverse cardiorespiratory and immunological changes Data from animal models and in vitro studies support the notion that longterm use of ecigarettes may pose significant health risks,Ophthalmologic nvolvement in SARSCoVinfected patients is variegated One of the ophthalmologic pathologies is optic neuritis Optic neuritis in SARSCoVinfected patients may precede the classical pulmonary manifestations of COVID19 and can be unilateral or bilateral Optic neuritis has been repeatedly reported in COVID19 patients and may occur with or without affection of other cranial nerves Since cerebrospinal fluid parameters can be abnormal in COVID19 associated optic neuritis, these patients require a spinal tap Before diagnosing SARSCoV2 associated optic neuritis various differentials need to be excluded Since SARSCoV2 causes endothelial damage complicated by thrombus formation and thromboembolism, ophthalmologic vascular complication due to an infection with SARSCoV2 such as anterior ischemic optic neuropathy AION, central retinal artery occlusion CRAO, and retinal vein occlusion need to be excluded CRAO may result from arterial hypertension, myocarditis, heart failure, Takotsubo syndrome, atrial fibrillation, or atrial flutter, frequent cardiac complications of COVID19 Since CRAO can be accompanied by ischemic stroke, patients with SARSCoV2 associated optic neuritis need to undergo a cerebral MRI,Importance The major North American professional sports leagues were among the first to return to fullscale sport activity during the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic Given the unknown incidence of adverse cardiac sequelae after COVID19 infection in athletes, these leagues implemented a conservative returntoplay RTP cardiac testing program aligned with American College of Cardiology recommendations for all athletes testing positive for COVID19 Objective To assess the prevalence of detectable inflammatory heart disease in professional athletes with prior COVID19 infection, using current RTP screening recommendations Design, Setting, and Participants This crosssectional study reviewed RTP cardiac testing performed between May and October 2020 on professional athletes who had tested positive for COVID19 The professional sports leagues Major League Soccer, Major League Baseball, National Hockey League, National Football League, and the mens and womens National Basketball Association implemented mandatory cardiac screening requirements for all players who had tested positive for COVID19 prior to resumption of teamorganized sports activities Exposures Troponin testing, electrocardiography ECG, and resting echocardiography were performed after a positive COVID19 test result Interleague, deidentified cardiac data were pooled for collective analysis Those with abnormal screening test results were referred for additional testing, including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging andor stress echocardiography Main Outcomes and Measures The prevalence of abnormal RTP test results potentially representing COVID19associated cardiac injury, and results and outcomes of additional testing generated by the initial screening process Results The study included 789 professional athletes mean SD age, 25 3 years 777 men 985 A total of 460 athletes 583 had prior symptomatic COVID19 illness, and 329 417 were asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic minimally symptomatic Testing was performed a mean SD of 19 17 days range, 3156 days after a positive test result Abnormal screening results were identified in 30 athletes 38 troponin, 6 athletes 08 ECG, 10 athletes 13 echocardiography, 20 athletes 25, necessitating additional testing 5 athletes 06 ultimately had cardiac magnetic resonance imaging findings suggesting inflammatory heart disease myocarditis, 3 pericarditis, 2 that resulted in restriction from play No adverse cardiac events occurred in athletes who underwent cardiac screening and resumed professional sport participation Conclusions and Relevance This study provides largescale data assessing the prevalence of relevant COVID19associated cardiac pathology with implementation of current RTP screening recommendations While longterm followup is ongoing, few cases of inflammatory heart disease have been detected, and a safe return to professional sports activity has thus far been achieved,Coronavirus 2019 COVID19 is responsible for the current pandemic which has already resulted in considerable mortality worldwide This systematic review was conducted to summarize the results of the published articles assessing the incidence of heart diseases in patients infected with COVID19 The electronic databases Scopus, Web of Science, Pubmed, Science Direct, and ProQuest were used to search for potentially relevant articles Articles published from Dec 2019 to April 2020 were included All crosssectional, retrospective or prospective observational cohort and casecontrol studies were selected which reported the incidence or prevalence of myocardial injury, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular disease in patients with confirmed COVID19 infection Based on the inclusion criteria, 12 articles were selected The incidence of cardiac injury was reported in 8 articles and 8 articles focused on the cardiovascular outcomes of COVID19 infection The incidence of new cardiac injury was reported to be 7277 in live and dead patients, respectively The results showed that patients with cardiac injury had worse outcomes including higher mortality than those without cardiac injury The most common cardiac injury outcomes were shock and malignant arrhythmias The most common radiographic findings in patients with cardiac injury were multiple mottling and groundglass opacities in the lungs 646 A significant number of patients with cardiac injury required noninvasive mechanical ventilation 463 or invasive mechanical ventilation 220 Acute respiratory distress syndrome was seen in 585, acute kidney injury in 85, electrolyte disturbances in 159, hypoproteinemia in 134, and coagulation disorders in 73 of patients with cardiac injuries In addition, survival days were negatively correlated with cardiac troponin I levels rxa0xa0042, 95, pxa0xa00005 The results of this review showed that myocardial injury in patients with COVID 19 has a poor prognosis Hence, cardiac investigation and management in these patients are crucial,,Congestive heart failure CHF is often associated with kidney and pulmonary dysfunction Activation of the reninangiotensinaldosterone system RAAS contributes to avid sodium retention, cardiac hypertrophy and oedema formation, including lung congestion While the status of the classic components of RAAS such as renin, angiotensin converting enzyme ACE, angiotensin II Ang II and angiotensin II receptor AT1 is well studied in CHF, the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme2 ACE2, a key enzyme of angiotensin 17 Ang 17 generation in the pulmonary, cardiac and renal systems has not been studied thoroughly in this clinical setting This issue is of a special interest as Ang 17 counterbalance the vasoconstrictory, proinflammatory and proproliferative actions of Ang II Furthermore, CHF predisposes to COVID19 disease severity, while ACE2 also serves as the binding domain of SARSCoV2 in human hostcells, and acts in concert with furin, an important enzyme in the synthesis of BNP in CHF, in permeating viral functionality along TMPRSST2 ADAM17 governs ACE2 shedding from cell membranes Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the expression of ACE2, furin, TMPRSS2 and ADAM17 in the lung, heart and kidneys of rats with CHF to understand the exaggerated susceptibility of clinical CHF to COVID19 disease Heart failure was induced in male Sprague Dawley rats by the creation of a surgical aortocaval fistula Shamoperated rats served as controls One week after surgery, the animals were subdivided into compensated and decompensated CHF according to urinary sodium excretion Both groups and their controls were sacrificed, and their hearts, lungs and kidneys were harvested for assessment of tissue remodelling and ACE2, furin, TMPRSS2 and ADAM17 immunoreactivity, expression and immunohistochemical staining ACE2 immunoreactivity and mRNA levels increased in pulmonary, cardiac and renal tissues of compensated, but not in decompensated CHF Furin immunoreactivity was increased in both compensated and decompensated CHF in the pulmonary, cardiac tissues and renal cortex but not in the medulla Interestingly, both the expression and abundance of pulmonary, cardiac and renal TMPRSS2 decreased in CHF in correlation with the severity of the disease Pulmonary, cardiac and renal ADAM17 mRNA levels were also downregulated in decompensated CHF Circulating furin levels increased in proportion to CHF severity, whereas plasma ACE2 remained unchanged In summary, ACE2 and furin are overexpressed in the pulmonary, cardiac and renal tissues of compensated and to a lesser extent of decompensated CHF as compared with their sham controls The increased expression of the ACE2 in heart failure may serve as a compensatory mechanism, counterbalancing the overactivity of the deleterious isoform, ACE Downregulated ADAM17 might enhance membranal ACE2 in COVID19 disease, whereas the suppression of TMPRSS2 in CHF argues against its involvement in the exaggerated susceptibility of CHF patients to SARSCoV2,,PURPOSE It has come to our attention that specific vascular changes VCs appear more frequently in chest computed tomography CT of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 In this study, we aimed to investigate if these specific VCs in chest CT correlate with clinical severity of the disease METHODS CT images of 102 patients who underwent lowdose noncontrast chest CT due to COVID19 between 11 March 2020 and 11 April 2020 were evaluated retrospectively The patients were divided into two groups based on the presence of VCs in CT images VCs in chest CT of patients with COVID19 were defined using the following descriptors decreased lumen caliber, vascular wall irregularity, angulation in the course of the vessel, vascular disruption, andor interruption The relationship of these VCs with disease symptoms fever, cough, shortness of breath, comorbid conditions diabetes, hypertension, asthma, smoking habit, diseasespecific laboratory changes white blood celllymphocyte count, neutrophillymphocyte ratio, Creactive protein CRP, Ddimer, lactate dehydrogenase LDH, ferritin, procalcitonin, lung parenchymal infiltration pattern groundglass opacity, crazypaving pattern, consolidation and its distribution peripheral, central, mixed, upper lobes, lower lobes, right middle lobe on CT were investigated by comparison of these variables between patients with and without VCs in chest CT RESULTS VCs were observed in 18 out of 102 patients 18 with typical parenchymal involvement for COVID19 There was no significant difference in terms of age and sex We found an irregularity in the wall of the vascular structures in the distal branches and decreased lumen caliber of the vessels related to groundglass opacities in 15 patients, concentric luminal narrowing in annular form in 4 patients, angulationtraction or springiness in the vascular structures towards the active lesions in 3 patients, and interruptions along the vascular course in 1 patient VCs were significantly correlated with fever 1218, 667 and shortness of breath 718, 39 These changes were significantly more remarkable in common disease involving both upper and lower lobes 1018, 56 In these cases, there was a substantial increase in CRP 1518, 83 mean, 5763 mgdL and LDH 818, 44 values compared to those who did not have any VCs CONCLUSION The results of this study suggest that specific VCs observed in chest CT may predict the disease severity in cases of COVID19 pneumonia These changes may be related to respiratory distress in the disease,OBJECTIVE The large amount of evidence and the renewed interest in upper and lower airways involvement in infectious and inflammatory diseases has led Interasma Global Asthma Association to take a position on United Airways Diseases UAD METHODS Starting from an extensive literature review, Interasma executive committee discussed and approved this Manifesto developed by Interasma scientific network INES members RESULTS The manifesto describes the evidence gathered to date and defines, states, advocates, and proposes issues on UAD rhinitis, rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis, and concomitantcomorbid lower airways disorders asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, obstructive sleep apnoea with the aim of challenging assumptions, fostering commitment, and bringing about change UAD refers to clinical pictures characterized by the coexistence of upper and lower airways involvement, driven by a common pathophysiological mechanism, leading to a greater burden on patients health status and requiring an integrated diagnostic and therapeutic plan The high prevalence of UAD must be taken into account Upper and lower airways diseases influence disease control and patients quality of life CONCLUSIONS Patients with UAD need to have a timely and adequate diagnosis, treatment, and, when recommended, referral for management in a specialized center Diagnostic testing including skin prick or serum specific IgE, lung function, fractional exhaled nitric oxide FeNO, polysomnography, allergenspecific immunotherapies, biological therapies and home based continuous positive airway pressure CPAP whenever these are recommended, should be part of the management plan for UAD Education of medical students, physicians, health professionals, patients and caregivers on the UAD is needed,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 has been associated with multiple direct and indirect cardiovascular complications We sought to analyse the association of host comorbidities chronic respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular disease CVD, hypertension or diabetes mellitus DM with the acute cardiovascular complications associated with SARSCoV2 infection Individual analyses of the majority of studies found median age was higher by ∼10 years in patients with cardiovascular complications Pooled analyses showed development of SARSCoV2 cardiovascular complications was significantly increased in patients with chronic respiratory illness odds ratio OR 167148,188, CVD OR 337257,443, hypertension OR 268211,341, DM OR 160131,195 and male sex OR 131121,142, findings that were mostly conserved during subanalysis of studies stratified into global geographic regions Age, chronic respiratory illness, CVD, hypertension, DM and male sex may represent prognostic factors for the development of cardiovascular complications in COVID19 disease, highlighting the need for a multidisciplinary approach to chronic disease patient management,A questionnaire on COVID19related thrombosis in patients hospitalized before Aug 31, 2020, was sent to 399 hospitals throughout Japan Responses were received from 111 278 with information on 6,202 COVID19 patients Of these, 333 and 56 required ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ECMO, respectively, and 212 died 34 Ddimer levels were measured in 750 of the patients, revealing that 92 and 76 exhibited Ddimer increases of 38fold and 8fold the reference value, respectively Thrombotic events occurred in 108 patients 186 of the 5,807 patients with available data including symptomatic cerebral infarction in 24, myocardial infarction in 7, deep vein thrombosis in 41, pulmonary thromboembolism in 30, and other thrombotic events in 22 Some patients developed multiple thrombotic events Thrombosis occurred in 32 patients with mild or moderate COVID19 severity 059 of those with data available and in 52 patients on ventilation or ECMO 135 of severe patients for whom data were available Thrombosis occurred in 67 patients during worsening clinical condition and in 26 during recovery Anticoagulant therapy was provided to 893 patients 146 of the 6,119 patients with available data, the main reasons being provided as elevated Ddimer levels and worsening clinical condition,INTRODUCTION Atrial fibrillation AF is a complex and multifactorial rhythm disorder Catheter ablation is widely used for the management of AF However, it is limited by relapse of the arrhythmia necessitating repeat procedures AREAS COVERED This review aims to discuss the predictors of postablation recurrent AF including age, gender, genetic predisposition, AF type and duration, comorbidities, lifestyle factors, echocardiographic parameters of heart chambers, left atrial fibrosis and ablation strategies and targets An extensive literature search was undertaken on PubMed and Google Scholar to obtain full texts of relevant AFrelated articles EXPERT OPINION Maintenance of stable sinus rhythm is the main intended outcome of AF ablation Therefore, it is very crucial to identify the risk factors that may influence the ablation success Most of these predictors such as comorbidities, ablation strategy and targets and lifestyle factors are either reversible or modifiable Thus, not only the awareness of these known risk factors by both patients and their physicians but also future research to identify the unknown predictors are critical to optimize care in this multifaceted morbidity,,BACKGROUND The purpose was to evaluate central pulmonary embolism PE in patients with Covid19 The association with severe radiological pulmonary changes, prophylactic anticoagulation and ICU care was assessed METHODS From 1 March until 31 May 2020, all inhospital patients with a positive PCR for SARSCoV2RNA and PE diagnosed with computed tomography pulmonary angiography were identified through diagnostic codes in medical charts PE was characterised as centralperipheral and unilateralbilateral Covid19 related lung changes were evaluated scoring the proportion of affected lung maxscore score 25 for all five lobes in both lungs ICU and nonICU patients were included and anticoagulant regimens were assessed RESULTS Of 1162 patients with Covid19, 41 were diagnosed with PE cumulative incidence 35, and of these 634 overall 22 had central PE PE on admission was present in 463 No differences were seen in the distribution of central vs peripheral PE in relation to prophylactic anticoagulation p317 Of ICU patients 824 were diagnosed with central PE compared to 500 among nonICU patients p05 No association was observed between the presence of central PE and the extent of radiological Covid19 changes p451 Mild 012 p and severe 1325 p pulmonary changes were seen in 634 and 366 of patients respectively CONCLUSIONS Overall, and especially in ICUpatients, a high proportion of central PE was seen and many were diagnosed at admission No association between central PE and prophylactic anticoagulation, or the extent of pulmonary Covid19 changes was observed,OBJECTIVE Acute aortic thrombosis and floating aortailiac thrombus are infrequent clinical conditions with high morbidity and mortality rates It was observed that SARSCoV2 coronavirus disease Covid19 caused a hyperinflammation and hyperimmune state and these conditions can result in a hypercoagulation and eventually thrombotic events might occur METHODS Here we presented two covid19 positive patients with rare aortic thrombotic events RESULTS Two patients underwent emergent diagnostic tests including computerized tomographic angiography Total aortic thrombosis just below the renal arising point was evaluated in one patient, and aortic floating thrombus was evaluated in other patient But despite initial medical therapies, the clinical conditions of the cases worsened and both patients died while on medical therapy before planned surgical intervention applied CONCLUSIONS Covid19 is not only the disease of lungs and inflammatory system also the disease of coagulation and vascular system Aortic thrombosis is rare and must be kept in mind in Covid19 patients with peripheral circulation impairment,Carotid freefloating thrombus is an uncommon entity that usually presents with neurologic symptoms Crescendo transient ischemic attack is an accepted indication for urgent carotid endarterectomy COVID19 is associated with severe thromboembolic complications We report the case of a 61yearold man who developed, two weeks after the diagnosis of COVID19, crescendo transient ischemic attack, complicating a large intraluminal floating thrombus within the right common carotid artery A carotid thromboendarterectomy under local anesthesia, with patch closure was immediately performed without complications We conducted a literature review to identify cases of common carotid artery thrombus related to COVID19 Carotid freefloating thrombus in the common carotid artery is exceptional However, since the beginning of the COVID19 pandemic, 15 cases have been published,Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 was first officially diagnosed in the city of Wuhan, China in January 2020 In reality, the disease was identified in December 2019 in the same city where patients began showing symptoms of pneumonia of unidentified origin Very soon the disease became a global pandemic due to the suppression of information in the country of origin and inadequate testing for the COVID19 virus Currently,  101 million people have been found positive for this virus and  217 million people have died There are no signs that COVID19 is slowing down This deadly virus affects multiple vital organs lungs, heart, nervous system, blood, and immune system, yet its exact mechanism of pathophysiology remains obscure Depending on the viral load, sick people often show symptoms of fever, cough, shortness of breath, coagulopathy, cardiac abnormalities, fatigue, and death Great strides have been made in COVID19 testing, thereby allowing timely therapeutic intervention Currently, vaccines are on the market from Pfizer, Moderna and Astra Zeneca with limited supply Phase III clinical trials are also underway from other manufacturers In the current scenario, nutraceuticals and other phytomineral supplements appear to be promising alternative solutions for the prevention and treatment of COVID19,,BACKGROUND Chronic respiratory diseases CRD are common among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 OBJECTIVES We sought to determine the association between CRD including disease overlap and the clinical outcomes of COVID19 METHODS Data of diagnoses, comorbidities, medications, laboratory results and clinical outcomes were extracted from the national COVID19 reporting system CRD was diagnosed based on ICD10 codes The primary endpoint was the composite outcome of needing invasive ventilation, admission to intensive care unit, or death within 30 days after hospitalization The secondary endpoint was death within 30 days after hospitalization RESULTS We included 39,420 laboratoryconfirmed patients from the electronic medical records as of May 6th, 2020 Any CRD and CRD overlap was present in 28 and 02 of patients, respectively COPD was most common 566, followed by bronchiectasis 279 and asthma 217 COPDbronchiectasis overlap was the most common combination 507, followed by COPDasthma 362 and asthmabronchiectasis overlap 159 After adjustment for age, sex and other systemic comorbidities, patients with COPD OR 171, 95 CI 144203 and asthma OR 145, 95CI 105198, but not bronchiectasis, were more likely to reach to the composite endpoint compared with those without at day 30 after hospitalization Patients with CRD were not associated with a greater likelihood of dying from COVID19 compared to those without Patients with CRD overlap did not have a greater risk of reaching the composite endpoint compared to those without CONCLUSION CRD was associated with the risk of reaching the composite endpoint, but not death, of COVID19,,,The diagnosis of acute myocarditis AM remains challenging because of its diverse clinical manifestations Thus, a wide range of diagnostic tests may be warranted Although cardiac magnetic resonance CMR is the preferred imaging technique, it may not be applicable in the acute AM phase Our case report highlights the usefulness and diagnostic accuracy of echocardiographic examination In the first 2dimensional echocardiography, the focal echobright was presented A reduced value of global longitudinal strain and regional disturbances of segmental myocardial strain, both longitudinal and circumferential, in the epicardial layer, were detected with a good correlation with CMR results,What is the incidence in pregnant women of preterm labor, Csection operation,

110, and prior VTE 75 Key medications included corticosteroids 226, statins 212, antiplatelets 206, and anticoagulants 206 Highest DDimer was greater than six times the upper limit of normal in 514 Statin and antiplatelet use were associated with decreased VTE or mortality each p,OBJECTIVES Lung ultrasound LUS can accurately diagnose several pulmonary diseases, including pneumothorax, effusion, and pneumonia LUS may be useful in the diagnosis and management of COVID19 METHODS This study was conducted at two United States hospitals from 3212020 to 6012020 Our inclusion criteria included hospitalized adults with COVID19 based on symptomatology and a confirmatory RTPCR for SARSCoV2 who received a LUS Providers used a 12zone LUS scanning protocol The images were interpreted by the researchers based on a predeveloped consensus document Patients were stratified by clinical deterioration defined as either ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death within 28u2009days from the initial symptom onset and time from symptom onset to their scan RESULTS N  22 patients N  36 scans were included Eleven 50 patients experienced clinical deterioration Among N  36 scans, only 3 8 were classified as normal The remaining scans demonstrated Blines 89, consolidations 56, pleural thickening 47, and pleural effusion 11 Scans from patients with clinical deterioration demonstrated higher percentages of bilateral consolidations 50 versus 15 P  033, anterior consolidations 47 versus 11 P  047, lateral consolidations 71 versus 29 P  030, pleural thickening 69 versus 30 P  045, but not Blines 100 versus 80 P  11 Abnormal findings had similar prevalences between scans collected 06u2009days and 1428u2009days from symptom onset DISCUSSION Certain LUS findings may be common in hospitalized COVID19 patients, especially for those that experience clinical deterioration These findings may occur anytime throughout the first 28u2009days of illness Future efforts should investigate the predictive utility of these findings on clinical outcomes,Background The COVID19 pandemic has drastically changed the delivery of secondary care services Selfcollection of capillary blood at home can facilitate the monitoring of patients with chronic disease to support virtual clinics while mitigating the risk of SARSCoV2 infection and transmission Objective To investigate the comparability of whole blood capillary and plasma venous samples for 15 routinely used biochemical analytes and to develop and pilot a usefriendly homecollection kit to support virtual outpatient clinical services Methods To investigate the comparability of whole blood capillary and plasma venous samples for 15 routinely requested biochemical analytes, simultaneous samples of venous and capillary blood were collected in EDTA and lithiumheparin plasma separation tubes that were of 46mL and 400600µL draw volume, respectively Venous samples were analysed within 4 hours of collection while capillary samples were kept at ambient temperature for 3 days until centrifugation and analysis Analyte results that were comparable between the matrices were then piloted in a feasibility study in three outpatient clinical services Results HbA1c, lipid profile and liver function tests were considered comparable and piloted in the patient feasibility study The homecollect kit demonstrated good patient usability Conclusion Home collection of capillary blood could be a clinicallyuseful tool to deliver virtual care to patients with chronic disease,,Abstract  Syrian golden hamsters  Mesocricetus auratus  infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 manifests lung pathology that resembles human COVID19 patients In this study, efforts were made to check the infectivity of a local SARSCoV2 isolate in hamster model and evaluate the differential expression of lung proteins during acute infection and convalescence The findings of this study confirm the infectivity of this isolate in vivo  Analysis of clinical parameters and tissue samples shows a similar type of pathophysiological manifestation of SARSCoV2 infection as reported earlier in COVID19 patients and hamsters infected with other isolates The lungassociated pathological changes were very prominent on the 4th day postinfection dpi, mostly resolved by 14dpi Here, we carried out quantitative proteomic analysis of the lung tissues from SARSCoV2infected hamsters at day 4 and day 14 post infection This resulted in the identification of 1,585 differentially expressed proteins of which 68 proteins were significantly altered among both the infected groups Pathway analysis revealed complement and coagulation cascade, platelet activation, ferroptosis and focal adhesion as the top enriched pathways In addition, we also identified altered expression of two pulmonary surfactantassociated proteins Sftpd and Sftpb, known for their protective role in lung function Together, these findings will aid in the identification of candidate biomarkers and understanding the mechanisms involved in SARSCoV2 pathogenesis   Graphical abstract,Background The emergence of the Coronavirus COVID19 pandemic increased the need for an effective treatment for respiratory conditions exponentially To meet this challenge, we reevaluated the effectiveness of our physical therapy protocols for respiratory conditions Protocols of interest were categorized as decongestive, neurogenic, mechanical, and immune modulating Objective The objective of this study is to evaluate which of our existing treatment protocols or protocol combinations produce the best outcome To do so, we analyzed which ones can meet the following criteria when compared to all other treatments test statistic  20 in parametric and nonparametric tests, statistical significance p  005, effect size larger than 02, difference in the Patient Identified Problem Scale PIP score above Minimal Clinically Important Difference MCID, and sample size minimum 15 treatments Design Retrospective multivariate analysis using a modified adaptive platform design Methods A computerized sampling using respiratory related key words from a blinded dataset yielded 178 patients with respiratory complaints or pain in the chest area Additional statistical analysis using parametric and nonparametric tests evaluated the difference between each treatment protocol and the rest of the treatments provided Results Several protocol combinations and one individual protocol passed the study criteria Cardiac vascular venous thoracic CVVT protocol was used most frequently within these combinations 7, followed by Urinary Drainage UD 4 Other protocols in this group were Cardiac Cervical Cranial Vascular CCCV, Venous Thoracic Cardiopulmonary VTCP, and Diaphragm Cranial Sinus DCS Among the respiratory specific protocols, CVVT was significantly better than VTCP 040, p  0001 Discussion and Conclusion For the patient population studied, CVVT appears to be the primary protocol to consider, followed by UD, CCCV, VTCP, and DCS Combining CVVT with Barral Abdominal Motility protocol Barral or VTCP with Lower Abdominal Urogenital LAUG on the same day might be required with acute patients,Purpose of ReviewThe COVID19 pandemic has forced many centerbased cardiac rehabilitation CBCR programs to close or limit their usual offerings In order for patients to continue to benefit from CR, programs need to rapidly adapt to the current environment This review highlights ways CR has evolved, and reviews the history of CR and recent advancements in telemedicine including remote patient monitoring, and mobile health that can be applied to CRRecent FindingsDespite that initial studies indicate that homebased CR HBCR is safe and effective, HBCR has faced several challenges that have prevented it from becoming more widely implemented Many previous concerns can now be addressed through the use of new innovations in homebased healthcare deliverySummarySince its inception, CR has become increasingly recognized as an important tool to improve patient mortality and quality of life in a broad range of cardiac diseases While there has been little need to modify the delivery of CR since the 1950s, COVID19 now serves as the necessary impetus to make HBCR an equal alternative to CBCR,BackgroundAir pollution exposure and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis IPF cause a poor prognosis after SARSCoV2 infection, but the underlying mechanisms are not well explored Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 TMPRSS2 are the keys to the entry of SARSCoV2 We therefore hypothesized that air pollution exposure and IPF may increase the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the lung alveolar region We measured their expression levels in lung tissues of control nonIPF and IPF patients, and used murine animal models to study the deterioration of IPF caused by particulate matter PM and the molecular pathways involved in the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2ResultsIn nonIPF patients, cells expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were limited to human alveolar cells ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were largely upregulated in IPF patients, and were coexpressed by fibroblast specific protein 1 FSP1u2009u2009lung fibroblasts in human pulmonary fibrotic tissue In animal models, PM exposure increased the severity of bleomycininduced pulmonary fibrosis ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were also expressed in FSP1 lung fibroblasts in bleomycininduced pulmonary fibrosis, and when combined with PM exposure, they were further upregulated The severity of pulmonary fibrosis and the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 caused by PM exposure were blocked by deletion of KC, a murine homologue of IL8, or treatment with reparixin, an inhibitor of IL8 receptors CXCR12ConclusionsThese data suggested that risk of SARSCoV2 infection and COVID19 disease severity increased by air pollution exposure and underlying IPF It can be mediated through upregulating ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in pulmonary fibroblasts, and prevented by blocking the IL8CXCR12 pathway,,We have shown previously that transplanted bone marrow mononuclear cells BMMNC, which are a cell fraction rich in hematopoietic stem cells, can activate cerebral endothelial cells via gap junctionmediated cellcell interaction In the present study, we investigated such cellcell interaction between mesenchymal stem cells MSC and cerebral endothelial cells In contrast to BMMNC, for MSC we observed suppression of vascular endothelial growth factor uptake into endothelial cells and transfer of glucose from endothelial cells to MSC in vitro The transfer of such a small molecule from MSC to vascular endothelium was subsequently confirmed in vivo and was followed by suppressed activation of macrophagemicroglia in stroke mice The suppressive effect was absent by blockade of gap junction at MSC Furthermore, gap junctionmediated cellcell interaction was observed between circulating white blood cells and MSC Our findings indicate that gap junctionmediated cellcell interaction is one of the major pathways for MSCmediated suppression of inflammation in the brain following stroke and provides a novel strategy to maintain the bloodbrain barrier in injured brain Furthermore, our current results have the potential to provide a novel insight for other ongoing clinical trials that make use of MSC transplantation aiming to suppress excess inflammation, as well as other diseases such as COVID19 coronavirus disease 2019,During the pandemic context, diagnostic algorithms had to be adapted considering the decimated medical personnel, local technical resources, and the likelihood of contamination Given the higher probability of thrombotic complications related to COVID19 and the availability of a duallayer spectral computed tomography CT scanner, we have recently adopted the use of lowdose, nongated, chest CT scans performed five minutes after contrast administration among patients admitted with acute ischemic stroke AIS undergoing cerebrovascular CT angiography Duallayer spectral CT comprises a single Xray source and twolayer detector with different photonabsorption capabilities In addition to conventional images, the two distinct energy datasets obtained enable multiparametric spectral analysis without need to change the original scanning protocol The two spectral features that emerge as most useful for patients with AIS are virtual monoenergetic imaging and iodinebased results Aside from the evaluation of lung parenchyma, this novel strategy enables ruling out cardioembolic sources and simultaneously providing evidence of pulmonary and myocardial injury in a single session and immediately after CT cerebrovascular angiography Furthermore, it involves a noninvasive, seemingly accurate, unsophisticated, safer very low radiation dose and no contrast administration, and cheaper tool for ruling out cardioembolic sources compared to transesophageal echocardiogram and cardiac CT Accordingly, we sought to standardize the technical aspects and overview the usefulness of delayedphase, lowdose chest spectral CT in patients admitted with AIS,The COVID19 pandemic surges on as vast research is produced to study the novel SARSCoV2 virus and the disease state it induces Still, little is known about the impact of COVID19induced microscale damage in the lung on global lung dynamics This review summarizes the key histological features of SARSCoV2 infected alveoli and links the findings to structural tissue changes and surfactant dysfunction affecting tissue mechanical behavior similar to changes seen in other lung injury Along with typical findings of diffuse alveolar damage affecting the interstitium of the alveolar walls and bloodgas barrier in the alveolar airspace, COVID19 can cause extensive microangiopathy in alveolar capillaries that further contribute to mechanical changes in the tissues and may differentiate it from previously studied infectious lung injury Understanding microlevel damage impact on tissue mechanics allows for better understanding of macroscale respiratory dynamics Knowledge gained from studies into the relationship between microscale and macroscale lung mechanics can allow for optimized treatments to improve patient outcomes in case of COVID19 and future respiratoryspread pandemics,There is growing evidence of neurological involvement in patients with coronavirus disease 19 COVID19, suggesting that GuillainBarre syndrome GBS can also occur with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 as a neurological complication Herein, we describe a unique case of a 45yearold male who manifested with sudden onset progressive symmetric ascending paralysis leading to quadriplegia one week after developing fever, cough, and dyspnea On examination, he had areflexia in lower limbs and hyporeflexia in upper limbs Hypoesthesia to fine touch and vibration distal to calf was noted His reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction RTPCR was positive for COVID19, and his cerebrospinal fluid CSF analysis revealed albumincytologic dissociation The diagnosis of GBS was made based on clinical presentation and neurophysiological studies due to COVID19 He was commenced on intravenous immunoglobulin, and improvement in his condition was observed He was discharged to a rehabilitation center for regular physical therapy,INTRODUCTION Rural regions have unique challenges with implementation of new therapies upon discharge from the hospital due to multiple barriers OBJECTIVES We investigated the effect of home noninvasive ventilation NIV plus implementation of a call center following hospitalization for acute exacerbations of COPD chronic obstructive lung disease on NIV usage and readmissions METHODS In this prospective pilot study, consecutive patients were screened at our institution for diagnosis of hypercarbic respiratory failure or COPD exacerbation from 2018 until 2019 Patients with more than 2 admissions in the last year were reviewed for eligibility Of the 82 patients screened, 22 were eligible There were 10 participants randomized to the intervention NIV and call center arm and 10 to NIV alone RESULTS A total of 20 patients were randomized mean age of 64, 45 males, BMI of 32 At three months, average usage was 321 days out of 90, 35 When comparing the call center group to the standard group, there was a statistically significant difference in total days of device usage 487 compared to 155 significant Uvalue of 16, critical value of U at p,Purpose The capability of lung ultrasound LUS to distinguish the different pulmonary patterns of COVID19 and quantify the disease burden compared to chest CT is still unclear Methods PCRconfirmed COVID19 patients who underwent both LUS and chest CT at the Emergency Department were retrospectively analysed In both modalities, twelve peripheral lung zones were identified and given a Severity Score basing on main lesion pattern On CT scans the wellaerated lung volume WALV was visually estimated Perpatient and perzone assessments of LUS classification performance taking CT findings as reference were performed, further revisioning the images in case of discordant results Correlations between number of diseasepositive lung zones, Severity Score and WALV on both LUS and CT were assessed The area under receiver operating characteristic curve AUC was calculated to determine LUS performance in detecting WALVu2009u200970 Results The study included 219 COVID19 patients with abnormal chest CT LUS correctly identified as positive 217 99 patients, but perzone analysis showed sensitivityu2009u200975 and specificityu2009u200966 The revision of the 121 55 cases with positive LUS and negative CT revealed COVIDcompatible lesions in 42 38 CT scans Number of diseasepositive zones, Severity Score and WALV between LUS and CT showed moderate correlations The AUCs for LUS Severity Score and number of LUSpositive zones did not differ in detecting WALVu2009u200970 Conclusion LUS in COVID19 is valuable for case identification but shows only moderate correlation with CT findings as for lesion patterns and severity quantification The number of diseasepositive lung zones in LUS alone was sufficient to discriminate relevant disease burden,The emerging role of colchicine in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases is a strong demand for a comprehensive understanding of its efficacy and safety This metaanalysis and systematic review aimed to study the efficacy in the reduction of adverse cardiovascular outcomes CO, and the risk of colchicinerelated adverse events CRAEs Fourteen thousand and nine eighty three patients from 22 randomized controlled trials RCTs were included, 9 in patients with coronary artery disease—CAD, 9 in patients with pericarditis, 4 in patients with atrial fibrillation—AF or heart failure Colchicine was efficacious in the reduction of adverse CO across different settings pericardial diseases reduced risk of recurrent pericarditis, 176 vs 35, RR 050, 95 CI 041061, CAD reduced risk of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stroke,coronary revascularization or hospitalization, 61 vs 85, RR 073, 95 CI 064083, AF reduced risk of arrhythmia recurrence, 142 vs 227, RR 062, 95 CI 044088 Colchicine was associated with increased risk of gastrointestinal CRAEs 112 vs 88, RR 187, 95 CI 141247 and drug discontinuation 54 vs 37, RR 158, 95 CI 125199 In both cases, the risk was proportional to the daily dose or duration of treatment, possibly due to early drug discontinuation or tolerance Other CRAEs musclerelated, liver,hematologic,cutaneous, infections were not increased by colchicine, as long as allcause death 22 vs 19, RR 111, 95 CI 079154 or noncardiovascular death 15 vs 1, RR 143, 95 CI 093219 Colchicine is efficacious and safe for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases The risk of gastrointestinal CRAEs and drug discontinuation is not significant if colchicine is used at lower doses 05xa0mg daily or for longer periods of time u20096xa0months,Background Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 has spread worldwide determining dramatic impacts on healthcare systems Early identification of highrisk parameters is required in order to provide the best therapeutic approach Coronary, thoracic aorta and aortic valve calcium can be measured from a nongated chest computer tomography CT and are validated predictors of cardiovascular events and allcause mortality However, their prognostic role in acute systemic inflammatory diseases, such as COVID19, has not been investigated Objectives The aim was to evaluate the association of coronary artery calcium and total thoracic calcium on inhospital mortality in COVID19 patients Methods 1093 consecutive patients from 16 Italian hospitals with a positive swab for COVID19 and an admission chest CT for pneumonia severity assessment were included At CT, coronary, aortic valve and thoracic aorta calcium were qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated separately and combined together total thoracic calcium by a central Corelab blinded to patients outcomes Results Nonsurvivors compared to survivors had higher coronary artery Agatston 4677657092 vs 2068042413 mm2, p0001

independent predictors of inhospital mortality Conclusion Coronary, aortic valve and thoracic aortic calcium assessment on admission nongated CT permits to stratify the COVID19 patients inhospital mortality risk,Upregulation of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme2 ACE2 was frequently observed in patients with lung cancer Interestingly, our recent study revealed that the same ACE2 receptor was also strongly upregulated in lungs during SARSCoV2 infection Therefore, it is possible that the upregulated expression of ACE2 in lung tumors might increase the susceptibility to COVID19 infection in lung cancer patients However, the molecular mechanism for the regulation of ACE2 is known neither in lung tumors nor in COVID19 Under this review, we attempt to identify transcription factors TFs in the promoter of ACE2 that promote the expression of ACE2 both in COVID19 infection and lung cancer This review would decipher the molecular role of ACE2 in the upscaled fatality of lung cancer patients suffering from COVID19,OBJECTIVESHYPOTHESIS Adenotonsillectomy is firstline treatment for pediatric obstructive sleep apnea syndrome OSAS when not otherwise contraindicated There is concern severe OSAS increases risk of comorbid cardiopulmonary abnormalities, such as ventricular hypertrophy or pulmonary hypertension, which preoperative testing could detect Our objective is to determine if there is a severity of pediatric OSAS where previously undetected cardiopulmonary comorbidities are likely STUDY DESIGN Retrospective chart review METHODS We performed a retrospective review of 358 patients 21u2009years with severe OSAS who underwent adenotonsillectomy at a tertiary hospital June 1, 2016 to June 1, 2018 We extracted demographics, comorbidities, polysomnography, and preoperative tests Wilcoxon ranksum and logistic regression estimated associations of OSAS severity based on obstructive apneahypopnea index OAHI, hypoxia, hypercarbia with preoperative echocardiograms and chest Xrays CXRs RESULTS Mean age was 59 36 years and 52 were male Mean OAHI and oxygen saturation nadir were 303 238 and 807 92, respectively OAHI 60 was associated with having a preoperative echocardiogram OR, 38 95 CI, 1785 or CXR OR, 30 95 CI, 1468 compared to OAHI 1059 There were no significant associations between OSAS severity and test abnormalities The presence of previously diagnosed cardiopulmonary comorbidities was associated with abnormalities on echocardiogram OR, 36 95 CI, 413201 and CXR OR, 41 95 CI, 12144 CONCLUSIONS Although pediatric patients with very severe OSAS OAHI 60 underwent more preadenotonsillectomy cardiopulmonary tests, OSAS severity did not predict abnormal findings Known cardiopulmonary comorbidities may be a better indication for cardiopulmonary testing than polysomnographic parameters, which could streamline preadenotonsillectomy evaluation and reduce cost LEVEL OF EVIDENCE 4 Laryngoscope, 2021,,,PURPOSE Our aim was to study the association between abnormal findings on chest and brain imaging in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 and neurologic symptoms MATERIALS AND METHODS In this retrospective, international multicenter study, we reviewed the electronic medical records and imaging of hospitalized patients with COVID19 from March 3, 2020, to June 25, 2020 Our inclusion criteria were patients diagnosed with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 infection with acute neurologic manifestations and available chest CT and brain imaging The 5 lobes of the lungs were individually scored on a scale of 05 0 corresponded to no involvement and 5 corresponded to 75 involvement A CT lung severity score was determined as the sum of lung involvement, ranging from 0 no involvement to 25 maximum involvement RESULTS A total of 135 patients met the inclusion criteria with 132 brain CT, 36 brain MR imaging, 7 MRA of the head and neck, and 135 chest CT studies Compared with 86 64 patients without acute abnormal findings on neuroimaging, 49 36 patients with these findings had a significantly higher mean CT lung severity score 99 versus 58, Pu20098 was found to be 74 sensitive and 65 specific for acute abnormal findings on neuroimaging The neuroimaging hallmarks of these patients were acute ischemic infarct 28, intracranial hemorrhage 10 including microhemorrhages 19, and leukoencephalopathy with andor without restricted diffusion 11 The predominant CT chest findings were peripheral groundglass opacities with or without consolidation CONCLUSIONS The CT lung disease severity score may be predictive of acute abnormalities on neuroimaging in patients with COVID19 with neurologic manifestations This can be used as a predictive tool in patient management to improve clinical outcome,BackgroundLung ultrasound LU is a useful tool for monitoring lung involvement in novel coronavirus COVID disease, while information on echocardiographic findings in COVID disease is to date scarce and heterogeneous We hypothesized that lung and cardiac ultrasound examinations, serially and simultaneously performed, could monitor disease severity in COVIDrelated ARDSMethodsWe enrolled 47 consecutive patients with COVIDrelated ARDS 1st March31st May 2020 Lung and cardiac ultrasounds were performed on admission, at discharged and when clinically neededResultsMost patients were mechanically ventilated 75 and venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was needed in ten patients 212 The inICU mortality rate was 27 On admission, not survivors showed a higher LUS score pu2009u20090006 and a higher incidence of consolidations pu2009u20090003, lower values of LVEF pu2009u20090027 and a higher RVLV ratio 0008 At discharge, a significant reduction in the incidence of subpleural consolidations p,OBJECTIVE Many patients with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 need mechanical ventilation secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome Information on the respiratory system mechanical characteristics of this disease is limited The aim of this study is to describe the respiratory system mechanical properties of ventilated COVID19 patients DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS Patients consecutively admitted to the medical intensive care unit at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in Iowa City, USA, from April 19 to May 1, 2020, were prospectively studied final date of followup was May 1, 2020 MEASUREMENTS At the time of first patient contact, ventilator information was collected including mode, settings, peak airway pressure, plateau pressure, and total positive end expiratory pressure Indices of airflow resistance and respiratory system compliance were calculated and analyzed MAIN RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 58 years 6 out of 12 50 patients were female Of the 21 laboratoryconfirmed COVID19 patients on invasive mechanical ventilation, 9 patients who were actively breathing on the ventilator were excluded All the patients included were on volumecontrol mode Mean standard deviation ventilator indices were resistive pressure 19 4 cmH2O, airway resistance 20 4 cmH2OLs, and respiratory system static compliance 39 16 mlcmH2O These values are consistent with abnormally elevated resistance to airflow and reduced respiratory system compliance Analysis of flow waveform graphics revealed a pattern consistent with airflow obstruction in all patients CONCLUSIONS Severe respiratory failure due to COVID19 is regularly associated with airflow obstruction,,Cadmium Cd has been confirmed as an environmental contaminant, which potential threats health impacts to humans and animals Selenium Se as a beneficial element that alleviates the negative effects of Cd toxicity Se mainly exists in two forms in food nutrients including organic Se usually as Seenriched yeast SeY and inorganic Se sodium selenite SSe Nanoparticle of Se NanoSe, a new form Se, which is synthesized by the bioreduction of Se species, which attracted significant attention recently However, compared the superiority alleviation effects of NanoSe, SeY or SSe on Cdinduced toxicity and related mechanisms are still poorly understood The purpose of this study was to compare the superiority antagonism effects of NanoSe, SeY and SSe on Cdinduced inflammation response via NFkBIκB pathway in the heart The present study demonstrated that exposed to Cd obviously increased the accumulation of Cd, disruption of ion homeostasis and depressed the ratios of KNa and Mg2Ca2 via ion chromatography mass spectrometry ICPMS detecting the heart specimens In the results of histological and ultrastructure observation, typical inflammatory infiltrate characteristics and mitochondria and nuclear structure alterations in the hearts of Cd group were confirmed Cd treatment enhanced the inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS activities and NOS isoforms expression via NFkBIκB pathway to promote inflammation response However, the combined treatment of Cdexposed animals with NanoSe was more effective than SeY and SSe in reversing Cdinduced histopathological changes and iNOS activities increased, reducing Cd accumulation and antagonizing Cdtriggered inflammation response via NFkBIκB pathway in chicken hearts Overall, Se applications, especially NanoSe, can be most efficiently used for relieving cardiotoxicity by exposed to Cd compared to other Se compound,Fiftyone consecutive adult congenital heart disease ACHD patients attended a single site, daycase facility in the midst of the Covid pandemicfor cardiac assessment tailored to their individual needs All patients responded positively to our one to one invitation to attend, despite Covid restrictions, and to our anonymized questionnaire The latter showed an overwhelming support for personalized care and for more patient education, support and empowerment A subset of patients have since been enrolled in a pilot App with HUMA on an ACHD education, selfreporting and selfmanaging tool, with potential worldwide implications for ACHD care,SwyerJamesMacLeod Syndrome SJMS is an uncommon, emphysematous disease characterized by obliteration of the small bronchioles, hypoplasiaor absence of pulmonary artery and peripheral vascular bed It is most commonly diagnosed in childhood Patients are often asymptomatic or they could suffer from symptoms of recurrent pulmonary infections Spontaneous pneumothorax is a rare presentation of this syndrome We report a case of a 42year old female patient presented at our Emergency Department with complaints of dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain with a diagnosis of spontaneous pneumothorax in emphysematous disease The diagnosis of SJMS is usually based on imaging and clinical findings rather than on the results of pathologic examination indeed, asymptomatic adult patients with SJMS are often diagnosed after a chest radiograph obtained for another reason Highresolution computed tomography HRCT seems to be the most appropriate technique for the diagnosis SJMS can be associated with spontaneous pneumothorax which represent an emergency condition due to the underlying pathological disease The surgical treatment of the affected lung should be considered when conservative approach is ineffective,Melatonin is a key intracellular neuroimmuneendocrine regulator and coordinator of multiple complex and interrelated biological processes The main functions of melatonin include the regulation of neuroendocrine and antioxidant system activity, blood pressure, rhythms of the sleepwake cycle, the retardation of ageing processes, as well as reseting and optimizing mitochondria and thereby the cells of the immune system Melatonin and its agonists have therefore been mooted as a treatment option across a wide array of medical disorders This article reviews the role of melatonin in the regulation of respiratory system functions under normal and pathological conditions Melatonin can normalize the structural and functional organization of damaged lung tissues, by a number of mechanisms, including the regulation of signaling molecules, oxidant status, lipid raft function, optimized mitochondrial function and reseting of the immune response over the circadian rhythm Consequently, melatonin has potential clinical utility for bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, lung vascular diseases, as well as pulmonary and viral infections The integration of melatonins effects with the alpha 7 nicotinic receptor and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the regulation of mitochondrial function are proposed as a wider framework for understanding the role of melatonin across a wide array of diverse pulmonary disorders,Heterotaxy syndrome is a rare condition characterized by the abnormal arrangement of thoracoabdominal organs across the leftright axis of the body It is generally classified as right and left atrial isomerism or asplenia and polysplenia syndrome, even though there are overlaps and uncertainties The diagnosis of isomerism is typically made by echocardiography However, multidetector computed tomography and MRI can help in obtaining detailed data on the morphology of the heart, great vessels, the anatomy of the internal organs, and their mutual arrangement that make an accurate diagnosis of heterotaxy syndrome The authors present here the imaging findings of the heterotaxy polysplenia syndrome in a 21yearold female with a complete endocardia cushion defect and a duplicated right renal vein,This study aimed to report histopathological features and serological outputs of the lung, heart and liver in a patient suffered from Coronavirus disease2019 COVID19 A woman was admitted to the Razi Hospital, Rasht city, Iran with the symptoms of cough, dyspnea, fever and myalgia She had also Parkinsons disease PD she had ,Introduction Blunt chest trauma is usually associated with a rapid deceleration of the heart and aorta, leading to aortic injury and transection The patient may be asymptomatic or present with nonspecific clinical manifestations Case presentation A 16yearold male was brought to the emergency unite of our hospital by land ambulance intubated as a Level 1 trauma activation, after having fallen from the 4th floor of a housing block at midnight and landed on the ground His blood pressure was 8856 mmHg, HR 145 bmin, and RR 35 cyclemin The physical examination revealed Glasgow Coma Scale E1M3V4, equally in diameter and reactive pupils with negative bilateral corneal reflexes The thoracoabdominal CT images showed a type4 transection in the descending aorta and a pseudoaneurysm of 85mm in diameter adjacent to the postvertebral segment of the left subclavian artery The patient was successfully managed by the endovascular intervention Discussion The clinical symptoms of aortic transection are nonspecific Thus the literature review and our findings highlight that the diagnosis of blunt thoracic aortic injury should be considered in any serious polytrauma in children Conclusion Traumatic aorta aortic transection is extremely rare in children than in adults and a potentially lifethreatening condition with myriad clinical manifestations that may present as hemorrhagic shock Computed tomography is an excellent imaging tool to assess the extent of the aortic injury and is used as a standard diagnostic method in cases of multiple trauma for the diagnosis of aortic transection The endovascular repair can be used as a firstline treatment and open surgical therapy is best reserved for patients with a failed endovascular approach or complications of postendovascular therapy and patients without an endovascular option,OBJECTIVES The novel corona virus disease, which was initially reported in China in late 2019, has become a global pandemic affecting 330 million cases COVID19 affects predominantly the respiratory system, in addition to other organ systems, mainly the cardiovascular system One of the hypotheses is that virus entering the target cells by binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 affecting hypothalamic pituitary axis could lead to dysautonomia which is measured by heart rate variability HRV HRV is a noninvasive measure of autonomic function that facilitates identification of COVID19 patients at the risk of developing cardiovascular complications So, we aimed to assess HRV in COVID patients and compare between COVID patients and normal controls METHODS In a case control design, we compared 63 COVID19 infected patients with 43 healthy controls matched for age and gender Along with clinical characterization, heart rate variability was evaluated using ambulatory 5xa0min ECG in lead II and expressed in frequency and time domain measures Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 170 RESULTS Mean age of the study population was 491xa0xa0142xa0years and 71 669 were males Frequency domain measures high HF and low LF frequency powers were significantly decreased in COVID19 patients compared to controls HFLF and LFHF ratios were not different between groups Time domain measures rMSSD root mean square of successive RR interval differences and SDNN standard deviation of NN intervals were significantly increased among COVID19 subjects COVID19 infection was associated with increased parasympathetic activity as defined by rMSSD40 adjusted odds ratio 7609 95 CI 1613594 p001 and SDNN60 adjusted odds ratio 2620 95 CI 1070644 p0035 after adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities CONCLUSIONS Our study results showed increased parasympathetic tone in COVID patients Early diagnosis of autonomic imbalance in COVID patients is needed to plan management and limit progression of disease,Otorhinolaryngologic symptoms such as cough, rhinorrhea, anosmia, ageusia, and fever can precede development of COVID19 Otolaryngologists are vulnerable to potential COVID19 infection because early cases of COVID19 have been asymptomatic or show mild manifestations Otolaryngologists should wear adequate personal protective equipment PPE according as location or situation PPE includes medical masks, goggles, and fluidresistant gown and gloves Authors provide clinical recommendations based on PPE for otorhinolaryngologists during the COVID19 pandemic In addition, we reviewed the literature related to clinical guidelines of foreign otorhinolaryngology societies with regard to COVID19,Essential hypertension is the most common cardiovascular CV risk factor, being primarily involved in the pathogenesis of CV disease and mortality worldwide Given the high prevalence and growing incidence of this clinical condition in the general population in both high and lowincome countries, antihypertensive drug therapies are frequently prescribed in different hypertensionrelated CV diseases and comorbidities Among these conditions, evidence are available demonstrating the clinical benefits of lowering blood pressure BP levels, particularly in those hypertensive patients at high or very high CV risk profile Preliminary studies, performed during the SarsCOVID19 epidemic, raised some concerns on the potential implication of hypertension and antihypertensive medications in the susceptibility of having severe pneumonia, particularly with regard to the use of drugs inhibiting the reninangiotensin system RAS, including angiotensin converting enzyme ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers ARBs These hypotheses were not confirmed by subsequent studies, which independently and systematically demonstrated no clinical harm of these drugs also in patients with SarsCOVID19 infection The aim of this narrative review is to critically discuss the available evidence supporting the use of antihypertensive therapies based RAS blocking agents in hypertensive patients with different CV risk profile and with additional clinical conditions or comorbidities, including SarsCOVID19 infection, with a particular focus on singlepill combination therapies based on olmesartan medoxomil,The host inflammatory response is critical in the progression of lung injuries in patients with SARSCoV2 Corticosteroids CSxa0have been widely used as immunomodulating agents, but the right timing, dosage andxa0type of molecule are unknown In fact, the early use of CS could facilitate the viral replication but late administration may not prevent the alveolar damage Nevertheless, a short administration of high doses of CS in the early stage of the inflammatory phase resulted in favorable outcomes Noteworthy, some inhaled CS inhibited in vitro the viral replication of SARSCoV2 We aimed to define the place in therapy for CS in COVID19 infection describing the features of patients who may benefit from their administration,The pathogenesis of SARSCoV2 remains to be completely understood, and detailed SARSCoV2 cellular cytopathic effects requires definition We performed a comparative ultrastructural study of SARSCoV1 and SARSCoV2 infection in Vero E6 cells and in lungs from deceased COVID19 patients SARSCoV2 induces rapid death associated with profound ultrastructural changes in Vero cells Type II pneumocytes in lung tissue showed prominent altered features with numerous vacuoles and swollen mitochondria with presence of abundant lipid droplets The accumulation of lipids was the most striking finding we observed in SARSCoV2 infected cells, both in vitro and in the lungs of patients, suggesting that lipids can be involved in SARSCoV2 pathogenesis Considering that in most cases, COVID19 patients show alteration of blood cholesterol and lipoprotein homeostasis, our findings highlight a peculiar important topic that can suggest new approaches for pharmacological treatment to contrast the pathogenicity of SARSCoV2,PURPOSE OF REVIEW Preventive cardiology has an important role to play in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 pandemic The SARSCoV2 pandemic has been observed to have a greater mortality impact on subgroups of people in the population who are deemed to be at higher medical disease risk Individuals with cardiovascular disorders are one such COVID19associated highmortality risk group RECENT FINDINGS Evidence is accumulating that COVID19 infection may worsen an individuals future cardiovascular health, and, preinfectionpostinfection cardiovascular evaluation may be warranted to determine if progressive cardiovascular damage has occurred because of COVID19 infection In this study, we conducted a systematic review and metaanalysis, focusing on the association between COVID19 severity and cardiacspecific biomarkers, including Nterminal proBtype natriuretic peptide NTproBNP, troponin T TnTtroponin I TnI, lactate dehydrogenase LDH, creatine kinase, and creatine kinase isoenzyme CKMB TnT had the highest odds ratio or OR 1183 indicating the greatest association with COVID19 severity, followed by NTproBNP 757, TnI 632, LDH 479, Ddimer 410, creatine kinase 343, and CKMB 335 All of the biomarkers studied were significantly correlated with COVID19 severity including severe symptoms, ICU care, and mortality P,The SARSCoV2 virus has resulted in over 88 million cases worldwide of COVID19 as of January 2021 The heart is one of the most commonly affected organs in COVID19, but the nature and extent of the cardiac pathology has remained controversial It has been shown that patients infected with SARSCoV2 can sustain type 1 myocardial infarction in the absence of significant atherosclerotic coronary artery disease However, many patients present with small elevations of troponin enzymes of unclear etiology which correlate with overall COVID19 disease outcome Early autopsy reports indicated variable levels of typical lymphocytic myocarditis, while radiology reports have indicated that myocarditis can be a persistent problem after recovery from acute illness, raising concern about participation in college athletics In this communication, we review the literature to date regarding the gross and microscopic findings of COVID19 cardiac involvement, present the findings from over 40 cases from our academic medical center, and propose mechanisms by which patients develop small elevations in troponin u2009,Diabetes is a leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality Despite numerous treatments for cardiovascular disease CVD, for patients with diabetes, these therapies provide less benefit for protection from CVD These considerations spur the concept that diabetesspecific, diseasemodifying therapies are essential to identify especially as the diabetes epidemic continues to expand In this context, high levels of blood glucose stimulate the flux via aldose reductase AR pathway leading to metabolic and signaling changes in cells of the cardiovascular system In animal models flux via AR in hearts is increased by diabetes and ischemia and its inhibition protects diabetic and nondiabetic hearts from ischemiareperfusion injury In mouse models of diabetic atherosclerosis, human AR expression accelerates progression and impairs regression of atherosclerotic plaques Genetic studies have revealed that single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs of the ALD2 human AR gene is associated with diabetic complications, including cardiorenal complications This Review presents current knowledge regarding the roles for AR in the causes and consequences of diabetic cardiovascular disease and the status of AR inhibitors in clinical trials Studies from both human subjects and animal models are presented to highlight the breadth of evidence linking AR to the cardiovascular consequences of diabetes,ObjectivesTo determine the effect of

protocol,Although the main vital organ affected by SARS CoV2 is the lung, more than 20 of hospitalized patients show heart injury, however, the underlying mechanisms are still actively investigated Inflammation or myocardial ischemia are now wellestablished pathogenic factors Direct cardiac damage by the virus is likely and might account for some aspects of cardiac disease in COVID19 patients However, precise knowledge on mechanisms of virus entry and progression in host cells and notably in cardiac cells is necessary in order to define the broad spectrum of pathogenicity of SARSCov2 on myocardium and to identify specific therapeutic targets This review will focus on the intracellular trafficking machinery, the Achilles heel of host cells, which can be used by the virus to infect cells of the cardiovascular system,During the COVID19 pandemic, the need for noninvasive respiratory support devices has dramatically increased, sometimes exceeding hospital capacity The fullface Decathlon snorkeling mask, EasyBreath EB mask, has been adapted to deliver continuous positive airway pressure CPAP as an emergency respiratory interface We aimed to assess the performance of this modified EB mask and to test its use during different gas mixture supplies CPAP set at 5, 10, and 15 cmH2O was delivered to 10 healthy volunteers with a highflow system generator set at 40, 80, and 120 Lxa0min1 and with a turbinedriven ventilator during both spontaneous and loaded resistor breathing Inspiratory CO2 partial pressure PiCO2, pressure inside the mask, breathing pattern and electrical activity of the diaphragm EAdi were measured at all combinations of CPAPflows delivered, with and without the resistor Using the highflow generator set at 40xa0Lxa0min1, the PiCO2 significantly increased and the system was unable to maintain the target CPAP of 10 and 15 cmH2O and a stable pressure within the respiratory cycle conversely, the turbinedriven ventilator did EAdi significantly increased with flow rates of 40 and 80xa0Lxa0min1 but not at 120xa0Lxa0min1 and with the turbinedriven ventilator EB mask can be safely used to deliver CPAP only under strict constraints, using either a highflow generator at a flow rate greater than 80xa0Lxa0min1, or a highperformance turbinedriven ventilator,As the United States original epicenter of the COVID19 pandemic and one of the leading national paediatric heart failurecardiomyopathy programs, we describe our experience with the spectrum of COVID19 in the paediatric heart failure population,We report on two living donors of explanted hearts while receiving heart transplantation that tested positive for SARSCoV2 on the day of donation, although clinically asymptomatic They underwent heart transplantation for ischaemic and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, respectively After evaluation of donor hearts, we cryopreserved and stored two pulmonary valves for clinical application and one aortic valve for research Light microscopy of myocardium, mitral valve and aortic and pulmonary arterial wall and RTPCR SARSCoV2 test of myocardium, mitral and tricuspid valve and aortic wall for detection of SARSCoV2 were performed Presence of ACE2 in tissues was assessed with immunostaining Light microscopy revealed a mild eosinophilic myocarditis in the ischemic cardiomyopathy heart, whereas enlarged cardiomyocytes with irregular nucleus and some with cytoplasmic vacuoles in the hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy heart Aortic and pulmonary wall were histologically normal Immunostaining revealed diffuse presence of ACE2 in the myocardium of the heart with eosinophilic myocarditis, but only discrete presence in the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy heart The RTPCR SARSCoV2 test showed no presence of the virus in tested tissues Despite eosinophilic myocarditis in the ischemic cardiomyopathy heart, no viral traces were found in the myocardium and valve tissues However, ACE2 was present diffusely in the ischemic cardiomyopathy heart SARSCoV2 could not be detected in the cardiac tissues of these COVID19 asymptomatic heart donors In our opinion, clinical application of the valves from these donors presents negligible risk for coronavirus transmission Nonetheless, considering the uncertainty regarding the risk of virus transmission with the human tissue transplantation, we would not release in any case the pulmonary valve recovered from the eosinophilic myocarditis heart In contrast, we may consider the release of the pulmonary valve from the dilated cardiomyopathy heart only for a lifethreatening situation when no other similar allograft were available,Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2, continues to be a worldwide pandemic with overwhelming socioeconomic impact Since inflammation is one of the major causes of COVID19 complications, the associated molecular mechanisms have been the focus of many studies to better understand this disease and develop improved treatments for patients contracting SARSCoV2 Among these, strong emphasis has been placed on proinflammatory cytokines, associating severity of COVID19 with socalled cytokine storm More recently, peptide bradykinin, its dysregulated signaling or bradykinin storm, has emerged as a primary mechanism to explain COVID19related complications Unfortunately, this important development may not fully capture the main molecular players that underlie the disease severity To this end, in this focused review, several lines of evidence are provided to suggest that in addition to bradykinin, two closely related vasoactive peptides, substance P and neurotensin, are also likely to drive microvascular permeability and inflammation, and be responsible for development of COVID19 pathology Furthermore, based on published experimental observations, it is postulated that in addition to ACE and neprilysin, peptidase neurolysin Nln is also likely to contribute to accumulation of bradykinin, substance P and neurotensin, and progression of the disease In conclusion, it is proposed that vasoactive peptide storm may underlie severity of COVID19 and that simultaneous inhibition of all three peptidergic systems could be therapeutically more advantageous rather than modulation of any single mechanism alone,BACKGROUND Webinars have recently replaced inperson medical conferences, including paediatric cardiology conferences, given the COVID19 pandemic METHODS With increasing environmental concerns, we analysed the differences between the environmental footprint of a paediatric cardiology webinar with a hypothetical conference Travel data was collected, with assumptions made on the amount of computer use, internet use and accordingly the overall use of electricity for both forms of conference Life Cycle Assessment methodology was used OpenLCA and Ecovinvent v 37 RESULTS We showed that the theoretical environmental impact of a virtual conference is significantly less 4 tons CO2 equivalent than the traditional international facetoface conference 192 tons CO2 equivalent The life cycle assessment methodology showed that resource use for a facetoface conference lasting 25 days for 1374 attendees is equivalent to 400 times what an average person would use in one year, the climate change and photochemical ozone formation approximately 250 times and the eutrophication terrestrial equivalent to 225 times However, using carbon equivalent emissions to measure environmental harm from flying is an under estimate of the potential damage, when one considers the additional production of airplane contrails Notwithstanding this, there is a 98 reduction in climate change impact when meetings are held virtually CONCLUSIONS While the virtual conference may never completely replace the traditional inperson paediatric cardiology conference, due to networking benefits, the significant theoretical benefits to the environment highlighted in this study, warrants consideration for the virtual conference taking a more common place in sustainable academia,Diureticinduced hypokalaemia is a common and potentially lifethreatening adverse drug reaction in clinical practice Previous studies revealed a prevalence of 756 of hypokalaemia in patients taking thiazide diuretics The clinical manifestations of hypokalaemia due to diuretics are nonspecific, varying from asymptomatic to fatal arrhythmia Diagnosis of hypokalaemia is based on the level of serum potassium ECG is useful in identifying the more severe consequences A high dosage of diuretics and concomitant use of other drugs that increase the risk of potassium depletion or cardiac arrhythmias can increase the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality Thiazideinduced potassium depletion may cause dysglycaemia The risk of thiazideinduced hypokalaemia is higher in women and in black people Reducing diuretic dose and potassium supplementation are the most direct and effective therapies for hypokalaemia Combining with a potassiumsparing diuretic or blocker of the reninangiotensin system also reduces the risk of hypokalaemia Lowering salt intake and increasing intake of vegetables and fruits help to reduce blood pressure as well as prevent hypokalaemia,Recent studies on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD patients in the context of the coronavirus 19 COVID19 pandemic have reported two important problems, ie, high mortality and vulnerability among COPD patients vs nonCOPD patients The high number of deaths are caused by exacerbations, COVID19, and other comorbidities Therefore, the purpose of this article is to reduce the risk factors of COPD in the COVID19 context In this article, we propose approaches based on adaptation mechanisms for detecting COVID19 symptoms, to better provide appropriate care to COPD patients To achieve this goal, an ontological model called SuspectedCOPDcoviDOlogy has been created, which consists of five ontologies for detecting suspect cases These ontologies use vital sign parameters, symptom parameters, service management, and alerts SuspectedCOPDcoviDOlogy enhances the COPDology proposed by a previous research project in the COPD domain To validate the solution, an experimental study comparing the results of an existing test for the detection of COVID19 with the results of the proposed detection system is conducted Finally, with these results, we conclude that a rigorous combination of detection rules based on the vital sign and symptom parameters can greatly improve the dynamic detection rate of COPD patients suspected of having COVID19, and therefore enable rapid medical assistance,COVID19 has led to morbidity in millions of patients, ranging from mild flulike symptoms to severe respiratory failure, necessitating oxygen supplementation and mechanical ventilation, and ultimately death The SARSCoV2 virus reacts with angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2 molecules that are especially found in alveolar epithelial type 2 cells in the lungs and thereby causes a loss in lung surfactant, a proteinlipid mixture that is crucial for both native immunity and reduction of surface tension in the lung alveoli Lung surfactant insufficiency results in atelectasis and loss of functional lung tissue amid an inflammatory storm and may be countered by treating COVID19 pneumonia patients with exogenous lung surfactant, preferably by aerosol delivery of a novel dry powder synthetic lung surfactant More research on timing, dosing, and delivery of synthetic lung surfactant in patients with COVID19 pneumonia is of crucial importance to implement this approach in clinical practice,,Backgroundxa0COVID19 disease is a huge burden for society and healthcare specialists As more information is gathered about this new disease, it becomes clear that it affects not only respiratory, but also cardiovascular systemMaterials and Methodsxa0The aim of this review is to analyse the information about myocardial injury caused by COVID19 and overview treatment options for these patients in publications which were published in the last 5 years The data for this overview were collected in the PubMed database Fulltext articles were used for analysis when their title, summary, or keywords matched the purpose of the review Only publications published in English that appeared in the last 5 years were analysed For the analysis 14 publications were selected and analysedConclusionxa0COVID19 infection could mimic STelevation myocardial infarction and it is crucial to differentiate the main cause and choose the appropriate treatment Cardiovascular complications are related with poorer prognosis and higher mortality This should be thoroughly considered by the healthcare specialists in order to choose appropriate treatment strategy Patients with acute coronary syndrome ACS due to plaque rupture should receive dual antiplatelet therapy and fulldose anticoagulation if it is not contraindicated Therefore, priority should be given to the acute coronary syndrome given the low evidence of new antiviral treatment effectiveness Number of agents which are under investigation for COVID19 may have interactions with oral antiplatelet drugs Selected patients could receive immunosuppressive treatment as well as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as a bridge to recovery,The reninaldosteroneangiotensin system RAAS plays an important role in the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19, which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2 is the cellular receptor for SARSCoV2 and the hosts expression of this membranebound protein could affect susceptibility to infection The RAAS is an important regulator of cardiovascular physiology and ACE2 has an essential role People with hypertension and other traits have shown to have an imbalance in ACEACE2 levels and reduced levels of ACE2 could enhance the risk of adverse outcome in patients with COVID19 It has been hypothesised that the RAAS may mediate the interplay between cardiovascular disease and COVID19 severity Evidence shows that antihypertensive drugs that target the RAAS have no significant effect on the risk of infection and disease outcome Variations in RAAS genes have been associated with the risk of developing hypertension and cardiovascular disease and could partly explain the heterogenous response to SARSCoV2 infection This article explores the interplay between the RAAS and COVID19, with emphasis on the possible relationship between genetic variations and disease severity,With interest we read the article by Assini et al, about a 77 years old male who developed ptosis, diplopia, dysarthria, and chewing difficulty 2 months after a mild infection with SARS‐CoV‐2, manifesting with fever and bilateral pneumonia COVID‐19 without necessitating continuous positive airway pressure CPAP, bilevel positive airway pressure BIPAP, or mechanical ventilation 1 Work‐up revealed muscle‐specific tyrosine‐kinase MuSK positive myasthenia gravis MG MuSK‐MG, which did not respond to pyridostigmin but to azathioprine 1 We have the following comments and concerns,Silent hypoxemia is common in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 infection In this article, the possible pathophysiological mechanisms underlying respiratory symptoms have been reviewed, and the presence of hypoxemia without hypoxia is also discussed The experience we have gained since the start of the COVID19 pandemic has changed our point of view about which patients with respiratory involvement should be admitted to the intensive care unithighdependency unit for mechanical ventilation and monitoring In patients with clinically welltolerated mild to moderate hypoxemia silent hypoxemia, regardless of the extent of pulmonary opacities found in radiological studies, the administration of supplemental oxygen therapy may increase the risk of endothelial damage The risk of sudden respiratory arrest during emergency intubation, which could expose healthcare workers to infection, should be considered along with the risks of premature intubation Criteria for intubation need to be revisited based on updated evidence showing that many patients with severe hypoxemia do not show increased work of breathing This has implications in patient management and may explain in part reports of broad differences in outcomes among intubated patients,Acute lung injury ALI is an inflammatory lung disease, which manifests itself in patients as acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS Previous studies have implicated alveolarepithelial succinate in ALI protection Therefore, we hypothesized that targeting alveolar succinate dehydrogenase SDH A would result in elevated succinate levels and concomitant lung protection Wildtype WT mice or transgenic mice with targeted alveolarepithelial Sdha or hypoxiainducible transcription factor Hif1a deletion were exposed to ALI induced by mechanical ventilation Succinate metabolism was assessed in alveolarepithelial via mass spectrometry as well as redox measurements and evaluation of lung injury In WT mice, ALI induced by mechanical ventilation decreased SDHA activity and increased succinate in alveolarepithelial In vitro, cellpermeable succinate decreased epithelial inflammation during stretch injury Mice with inducible alveolarepithelial Sdha deletion Sdhaloxploxp SPCCreER mice revealed reduced lung inflammation, improved alveolar barrier function, and attenuated histologic injury Consistent with a functional role of succinate to stabilize HIF, Sdhaloxploxp SPCCreER experienced enhanced Hif1a levels during hypoxia or ALI Conversely, Hif1aloxploxp SPCCreER showed increased inflammation with ALI induced by mechanical ventilation Finally, wildtype mice treated with intratracheal dimethlysuccinate were protected during ALI These data suggest that targeting alveolarepithelial SDHA dampens ALI via succinatemediated stabilization of HIF1A Translational extensions of our studies implicate succinate treatment in attenuating alveolar inflammation in patients suffering from ARDS,Objective We examine how emergency department ED visits for serious cardiovascular conditions evolved in the coronavirus COVID19 pandemic over JanuaryOctober 2020, compared to 2019, in a large sample of US EDs Methods We compared 2020 ED visits before and during the COVID19 pandemic, relative to 2019 visits in 108 EDs in 18 states in 115,716 adult ED visits with diagnoses for five serious cardiovascular conditions STsegment elevation myocardial infarction STEMI, nonSTsegment elevation myocardial infarction NSTEMI, ischemic stroke IS, hemorrhagic stroke HS, and heart failure HF We calculated weekly ratios of ED visits in 2020 to visits in 2019 in the prepandemic Jan 1March 10, earlypandemic March 11April 21, and laterpandemic April 22October 31 periods Results ED visit ratios show that NSTEMI, IS, and HF visits dropped to lows of 56, 64, and 61 of 2019 levels, respectively, in the earlypandemic and gradually returned to 2019 levels over the next several months HS visits also dropped early pandemic period to 60 of 2019 levels, but quickly rebounded We find mixed evidence on whether STEMI visits fell, relative to prepandemic rates Total adult ED visits nadired at 57 of 2019 volume during the earlypandemic period and have only party recovered since, to approximately 84 of 2019 by the end of October 2020 Conclusion We confirm prior studies that ED visits for serious cardiovascular conditions declined early in the COVID19 pandemic for NSTEMI, IS, HS, and HF, but not for STEMI Delays or nonreceipt in ED care may have led to worse outcomes,Virtual clinics have played a huge role in the continuation of service provision during the COVID19 pandemic This article provides an overview of how one heart failure clinic transferred its services to virtual clinics and what is needed to sustain these changes going forward,,In this nested casecontrol study, we evaluated haematological and morphological parameters of hospitalised patients with realtime polymerase chain reaction verified COVID19 infection compared to patients with similar symptomatology but without COVID19 infection Seventyfour COVID19 positive and 228 COVID19 negative patients were evaluated with routine haematological parameters Severe disease was defined as death andor need of intensive care treatment Twentyseven COVID19 positive and 18 COVID19 negative patients were furthermore included for morphological evaluation using smear examination Significant differences were found for platelet indices and white blood cell parameters Thus, platelet count and plateletcrit was lower in COVID19 patients, whilst mean platelet volume, platelet distribution width, and platelet large cell ratio was significantly higher than in nonCOVID19 patients Leukocyte, neutrophil, immature granulocyte, lymphocyte, monocyte, eosinophil, and basophil count was lower in COVID19 patients No significant differences were found for red blood cell count, haemoglobin, haematocrit or mean corpuscular haemoglobin for COVID19 versus nonCOVID19 patients COVID19 patients with a severe disease course had higher levels of immature granulocytes, but lower lymphocyte and platelet counts compared to patients with nonsevere COVID19 In terms of morphology, 148 of COVID19 patients had a normal smear examination, compared to 833 of nonCOVID19 patients Hypogranulated neutrophils were more frequent in COVID19 patients pu2009u2009001, but nonCOVID19 patients had higher levels of reactive lymphocytes, compared to COVID19 patients In conclusion, several haematological morphological abnormalities are more frequent in patients with COVID19 disease, and several findings indicate that platelets play a fundamental role in the pathophysiology of the disease,In the present scientometric analysis, the research performance in the field of cardiovascular medicine was examined, taking the increasing subspecialization into account The analysis showed that research activity was highest in the field of coronary artery disease CAD with 6153 publications, whereas, for example, the field of peripheral artery occlusive disease PAOD showed lower activity with 2261 original articles Axa0further examination of the research performance was carried out separately for all federal states both in terms of the number of inhabitants and the gross domestic product, GDP, as well as the number of medical faculties in which thematic focusses could be noted The quality of cardiovascular research was determined using the Hirschxa0H index Here, the fields of CAD and arrhythmia showed the highest scores with an H index of 101 In addition, axa0genderspecific analysis of cardiovascular subspecialties was performed, which revealed axa0clear difference between the various subject areas The percentage of women was lowest in research in the field of arrhythmia 17 compared to the field of heart failure with the highest proportion of women 25 In all analyzed subspecialties, there has been axa0significant increase in female authors within the last 20xa0years The average H index was also lower for women but the difference was less pronounced here than in the absolute number of publications Furthermore, international collaborations were commonly observed, with the USA being Germanys most frequent cooperation partner in all subject areas, followed by numerous neighboring European countries,Statin therapy is associated with less ICU admissions in COVID19 patients A preliminary analysis of the current observations  Minerva Anestesiologica 2021 Mar 10  Minerva Medica  Journals,BackgroundPlatform trials improve the efficiency of the drug development process through flexible features such as adding and dropping arms as evidence emerges The benefits and practical challenges of implementing novel trial designs have been discussed widely in the literature, yet less consideration has been given to the statistical implications of adding armsMainWe explain different statistical considerations that arise from allowing new research interventions to be added in for ongoing studies We present recent methodology development on addressing these issues and illustrate design and analysis approaches that might be enhanced to provide robust inference from platform trials We also discuss the implication of changing the control arm, how patient eligibility for different arms may complicate the trial design and analysis, and how operational bias may arise when revealing some results of the trials Lastly, we comment on the appropriateness and the application of platform trials in phase II and phase III settings, as well as publicly versus industryfunded trialsConclusionPlatform trials provide great opportunities for improving the efficiency of evaluating interventions Although several statistical issues are present, there are a range of methods available that allow robust and efficient design and analysis of these trials,The article reviews 60 publications and addresses key aspects of concurrent COVID19 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD It presents data stating that COPD patients have higher expression of the receptor of angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 in the lungs and this may contribute to a greater susceptibility to COVID19 In COPD, signs of endothelial cell dysfunction and tendency to thrombus formation have been identified which can present the risk of unfavorable outcomes of COVID19 Cohort study data do not confirm that COPD patients are more susceptible to SARSCoV2 infection, but their clinical outcomes of COVID19 appear to be worse including the need for mechanical ventilation and lethality There is no clinical evidence about the role of inhaled glucocorticosteroids used to manage COPD in the development and course of COVID19,Intraoperative autologous blood donation is a blood conservation technique with limited evidence We evaluated the association between intraoperative autologous blood donation and decrease in perioperative transfusion in cardiovascular surgery based on evidence from a Japanese administrative database We extracted the data of patients who had undergone cardiovascular surgery from the Diagnosis Procedure Combination database in Japan 20162019 Based on the surgery type, we examined the association of intraoperative autologous blood donation with the transfusion rate and amount of blood used in cardiac and aortic surgeries using multilevel propensity score matching We enrolled 32,433 and 4,267 patients who underwent cardiac and aortic surgeries and received 50 and 67 intraoperative autologous blood donation with mean volumes of 55768 mL and 61696 mL, respectively The red blood cell transfusion rates of the control and intraoperative autologous blood donation groups were 606 and 384, respectively, in the cardiac surgery cohort p  001 and 914, and 838, respectively, in the aortic surgery cohort p  037 The transfusion amounts for the control and intraoperative autologous blood donation groups were 59 and 35 units of red blood cells, respectively, for cardiac surgery patients p  001 and 119 and 79 units, respectively, for aortic surgery patients p  001 Intraoperative autologous blood donation could reduce the transfusion rate or amount of red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma for patients undergoing index cardiovascular surgery and could be an effective blood transfusion strategy in cardiovascular surgery for Japanese patients,In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2, was reported in Wuhan, China An 82yearold woman presented to our hospital with high fever 39°C and chest computed tomography revealed groundglass opacities in the left lung apex She was positive for SARSCoV2 based on a polymerase chain reaction test, and diagnosed with COVID19 pneumonia6 months after treatment, chest CT showed a large bulla 47 mmu202f×u202f29 mm in the left lung apex, although pneumonia had partially resolved Radiologic followup is needed after COVID19 pneumonia, because patients may develop bullae after treatment,Corona Virus Disease of 2019 COVID19 pandemic has affected more than 679 million individuals worldwide and led to more than 155 million Deaths In the initial studies from China, 887 of the patient were noted to have fever, 67 of the patient had cough and 564 had ground glass changes on the chest imaging With time, the presentation of patients has been found to be highly variable and unpredictable COVID19 is reported to present with various complications, ranging from gastrointestinal GI manifestations, such as loss of sensation of taste, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, pancreatitis and hepatobiliary disease, to neurological manifestations of encephalitis and stroke, and cardiovascular manifestations like myocarditis, heart failure and arrythmia We report a rare case of COVID19 presenting with abdominal pain from aortitis,A regional multicentric survey on variability and accuracy in lung ultrasound interpretation during the COVID19 pandemic  Minerva Anestesiologica 2021 Mar 10  Minerva Medica  Journals,Air pollution has been associated with respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD and lung malignancies The aim of this narrative review is to analyze the current data on the possible association between air pollution and interstitial lung disease ILD There are multiple studies showing the association of ILD with air pollution but the mechanism remains unclear Although some of the environmental factors have been associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis IPF, hypersensitivity pneumonitis HP, and pneumoconiosis, data about other ILDs are scarce and not well known Air pollution as an etiology for ILD may act in multiple ways, leading to disease pathogenesis or exacerbation of underlying ILD Clinical implications of this association are manifold limiting the exposure to poorquality air could possibly reduce the fall in lung functions and the risk of acute exacerbations of the underlying ILD,IntroductionThe year 2020 will always stand in the shadow of the pandemic triggered by the coronavirus 2019 COVID19 The first three quarter years of 2020 were characterized by an unprecedented reduction of elective inpatient services and a prioritization of intensive care capacity for the treatment of COVID19 patients This also resulted in clear consequences for the services provided in cardiac surgery In addition, during the course of the year the personnel in hospitals were confronted with a plethora of amendments in the legal framework conditions Nevertheless, the modified German diagnosisrelated groups GDRG system 2021 was calculated by the Institute for the Remuneration System in Hospitals InEK This article describes and assesses the most important amendments of the modified G‑DRG system 2021 for cardiac, thoracic and vascular surgeryMethodsAnalysis of the relevant diagnoses, procedures and G‑DRG structures in the system versions for 2020 and 2021 based on the information published by the InEK and the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices BfArMResultsExpansions of the relevant classification systems for diagnoses ICD10GM 2021 and procedures OPS 2021 lead to an increase in specific coding of essential interventions and operations in cardiovascular surgery Within the framework of the adaptation of the G‑DRG structures, the condensation of the previous fixed rates for heart transplantation to G‑DRG A05Z and devaluation of coronary bypass operations and reconstructive vascular interventions are particularly importantConclusionFor cardiovascular surgery there are manifold amendments with sometimes substantial repercussions for the case proceeds Additionally, for many German hospitals the effects of the corona pandemic are not yet finally foreseeable A further increasingly more urgent influencing factor particularly affecting vascular medicine is the increasing pressure to promote outpatient treatment In this respect, the catalogue for outpatient operations in hospitals AOP, which is expected in 2022 and will presumably be much expanded, will once again clearly increase the enforcement of outpatient performance of services that were previously performed as inpatient treatment,Arterial hypertension remains the most significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease and associated disability worldwide In the field of arterial hypertension the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic also determined major parts of the scientific debate Arterial hypertension is associated with a severe course of COVID19, whereas risk of infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 does not appear to be increased in hypertensive individuals According to current data, treatment with angiotensinconverting enzyme ACE inhibitors and angiotensin typexa01 receptor blockers is not associated with an increased risk of SARSCoV‑2 infection or with axa0more severe course of COVID19 Axa0study on antihypertensive chronotherapy determined the scientific discourse on the medication treatment of hypertension The HYGIA study concluded that bedtime medication reduces the cardiovascular risk in patients with arterial hypertension Due to some study limitations, routine administration of bedtime antihypertensive medication cannot be recommended Some of the reasons are discussed herein Another scientific focus was on new renal denervation studies Here, one can summarize that according to novel evidence, catheterbased renal denervation is an effective and safe procedure for the treatment of arterial hypertension, which could become established as an alternative to pharmaceutical blood pressure reduction in the near future,Heart failure symptoms, in particular dyspnea, may be difficult to frame in a patient with cancer We report the case of an oncological patient whose dyspnea could have been attributable to various causes and whose management was challenging in the context of the coronavirus disease2019 pandemic Level of Difficulty Beginner,Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging MRI has been established as an important noninvasive diagnostic tool in cardiology and is continuously evolving This article exemplarily presents three interesting MRI studies published in recent months that cover the topics MRI and COVID19, fibrosis and aortic valve stenosis and MRI and artificial intelligence In addition, new MRI position statements regarding MRI indications, MRI protocols, MRI postprocessing and MRI reference values are described Furthermore, the role of cardiac MRI in the cardiology guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology and the American Heart Association  published in 2020 is presented Finally, an actual overview regarding the certification programme for CMR by the German Society for Cardiology is given,Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2 protects against organ damage in hypertension and cardiovascular diseases by counter regulating the reninangiotensin system RAS ACE2 is also the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 Based on the claim that RAS inhibitors RASIs cause ACE2 overexpression in some animal experiments, concerns have arisen that RASIs may aggravate SARSCoV2 infection and coronavirus disease2019 severity in RASItreated patients To achieve a comprehensive review, a systematic search of MEDLINEPubMed was conducted regarding the effects of RASIs on tissue ACE2 mRNAprotein expression in healthy animals and animal models of human diseases We identified 88 eligible articles involving 168 experiments in the heart, kidneys, lungs, and other organs Three of 38 experiments involving healthy animals showed ACE2 expression greater than twice that of the control overexpression Among 102 disease models 130 experiments, baseline ACE2 was overexpressed in 16 models 18 experiments and less than half the control level repression in 28 models 40 experiments In 72 experiments, RASIs did not change ACE2 levels from the baseline levels of disease models RASIs caused ACE2 overexpression compared to control levels in seven experiments, some of which were unsupported by other experiments under similar conditions In 36 experiments, RASIs reversed or prevented diseaseinduced ACE2 repression, yielding no or marginal changes Therefore, ACE2 overexpression appears to be a rare rather than common consequence of RASI treatment in healthy animals and disease models Future studies should clarify the pathophysiological significance of RASIinduced reversal or prevention of ACE2 repression in disease models,Objective  to evaluate the role and place of MRI lung screening in the detection of pneumonia and patient routing   Material and methods  500 MRI tests were performed in the period from November 1, 2020 to December 15, 2020 on the basis of more than 20 diagnostic centers of the federal MRIExpert network Two groups were identified In Group 1 control, n  50 MRI studies were compared with CT studies in a single time interval of 02 days 25 patients had a positive PCR test for SARSCoV2 and 25 patients were conditionally healthy In Group 2 effective, n  450 mediastinal MRI was performed with lung screening on Philips 15 T and Siemens 15 T devices The statistical analysis of the medical data base was performed   Results  During the study, mandatory and additional MRI scanning programs were identified for Philips 15 T tomograph, the mandatory programs are sSShfb tra and cor THRIVE tra inhaleexhale for Siemens 15 T  T2BLADE cor, tra, sag When comparing the visual data of the control group n  25 with a positive PCR test in a single time interval of 02 days, the fact of detecting MR changes coincided with CT changes in 76 of cases n  19 The group of patients were examined by only one method  MRIscreening of the lungs n  475, pathological changes in the lungs were detected in 44 n  209 Localizations ofxa0the pathological changes were as follows bilateral changes  703 n  147, rightside changes  196 n  41, leftside changes  10 n  21 lower parts 268 n  26, average departments  10 n  21, the upper divisions  148 n  31, midlower 296 n  62, total  186 n  39 The ranges of the area of lesion of the pulmonary parenchyma on MRI were graded according to MRI criteria into 4 groups  25, 25  50, 50  75,  75 The collective radiation dose decrease was calculated for a group of patients n  450, which averaged 2025 manSv for 15 months, of which 0077 manSv were control studies   Conclusion  Based on the results obtained, the analyses of the possibilities of the MRI method in displaying pulmonary changes was performed The method of MRI screening of the lungs is recognized as a possible alternative to computed tomography for dynamic monitoring in conditions of a shortage of CT records or the inability to perform it, and as a tool to reduce the collective effective dose of radiation to the population,In the field of ischemic heart disease 2020 was an exciting year The coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic had axa0major impact on the diagnostics and treatment of coronary heart disease in many ways In addition, the results of the ISCHEMIA study have at least in part questioned the previous practice of the treatment of stable chronic coronary syndrome CCS In this study, myocardial revascularization was not associated with improvement in the prognosis of patients with stable ischemia but resulted in an improvement in the quality of life and angina pectoris symptoms compared to optimal medical therapy In the field of acute coronary syndromes ACS, publications from 2020 enhanced the concepts of the new European guidelines on nonSTsegment elevation ACS NSTEACS For the first time, the benefit of early invasive treatment in NSTEACS could be demonstrated for patients u202f80xa0years of age Recent analyses also confirmed the concept of complete revascularization for multivessel disease in STsegment elevation myocardial infarction without shock This concept is now being applied to NSTEACS In antiplatelet therapy, recent studies challenged antiplatelet pretreatment as part of the early invasive strategy with unknown coronary artery status Several studies showed the potential benefit of deescalation of antiplatelet therapy after NSTEACS, especially in older patients, Antifibrotic agents are known to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis The two antifibrotic agents approved and in usage are Pirfenidone and Nintedanib granted by the USFDA in 2014 They are both known to decrease inflammation in the lungs The fact that COVID19 has shown to cause inflammation and fibrosis in the lungs frames the theory of their usage in the treatment of the disease by reducing lung scaring and allowing faster discharge of patients with postCOVID complications The need for them to change their status from orphans to blockbusters has not happened yet due to fewer data and less research available on them as well as various other economic and patientrelated factors Since COVID19 is widespread and causes many complications of the lungs that are similar to what these two drugs treat We believe that the status of these drugs could be changed due to an increase in demand for them,The most severe clinical manifestations of the Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2, are due to an unbalanced immune response and a prothrombotic hemostatic disturbance, with arterial hypertension or diabetes as acknowledged risk factors While waiting for a specific treatment, the clinical management of hospitalized patients is still a matter of debate, and the effectiveness of treatments to manage clinical manifestations and comorbidities has been questioned In this study, we aim to assess the impact of the clinical management of arterial hypertension, inflammation and thrombosis on the survival of COVID19 patients The Spanish cohorts included in this observational retrospective study are from HM Hospitales 2035 patients and from Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias 72 patients Kaplan Meier survival curves, Cox regression and propensity score matching analyses were employed, considering demographic variables, comorbidities and treatment arms when opportune as covariates The management of arterial hypertension with angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2 inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers is not detrimental, as was initially reported, and neither was the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs NSAIDs On the contrary, our analysis shows that the use on itself of corticosteroids is not beneficial Importantly, the management of COVID19 patients with low molecular weight heparin LMWH as an anticoagulant significantly improves the survival of hospitalized patients These results delineate the current treatment options under debate, supporting the effectiveness of thrombosis prophylaxis on COVID19 patients as a firstline treatment without the need for compromising the treatment of comorbidities, while suggesting cautiousness when administering corticosteroids,INTRODUCTION One important concern during the management of COVID19 pneumonia patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is early anticipation of the need for intubation ROX is an index that can help in identification of patients with low and those with high risk of intubation So, this study was planned to validate the diagnostic accuracy of the ROX index for prediction of COVID19 pneumonia outcome the need for intubation and, in addition, to underline the significant association of the ROX index with clinical, radiological, demographic data MATERIAL AND METHODS Sixtynine RTPCR positive COVID19 patients were enrolled The following data were collected medical history, clinical classification of COVID19 infection, the ROX index measured daily and the outcome assessment RESULTS All patients with severe COVID19 infection 100 were intubated 50 of them on the 3rd day of admission, but only 38 of patients with moderate COVID19 infection required intubation all of them on the 3rd day of admission The ROX index on the 1st day of admission was significantly associated with the presence of comorbidities, COVID19 clinical classification, CT findings and intubation p  0001 for each of them Regression analysis showed that sex and ROX1 are the only significant independent predictors of intubation AOR 95 CI 169 24 117, 077 069086, respectively Cutoff point of the ROX index on the 1st day of admission was  2526 902 of sensitivity and 75 of specificity CONCLUSIONS ROX is a simple noninvasive promising tool for predicting discontinuation of highflow oxygen therapy and could be used in the assessment of progress and the risk of intubation in COVID19 patients with pneumonia,Background Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is a systemic infection with cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, neurological, and hematological manifestations Abnormal hematological findings are thought to have a role in early risk stratification and prognostication of COVID19 patients However, the data on hematological abnormalities associated with the disease among Ethiopian COVID19 patients are limited Objective To determine the magnitude of hematological abnormalities among COVID19 patients admitted at Millennium COVID19 referral treatment center, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia Methods A prospective crosssectional study was conducted among COVID19 patients admitted to Millennium COVID19 referral treatment center from May to July, 2020 A total of 334 COVID19 patients were included using convenience sampling Sociodemographic data and disease severity status of admitted patients were recorded Three milliliters of venous blood was collected and analyzed by Beckman Coulter DXH600 automated analyzer to determine complete blood count CBC The data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 23 software Association of age, sex, and disease severity with hematological abnormalities was analyzed using binary logistic regression An odds ratio and 95 confidence interval were used to measure the strength of association Pvalue 005 was considered as statistically significant Results Of 334 admitted COVID19 patients, the majority were males 623 and 698 had moderate disease conditions The overall magnitude of any cytopenia and pancytopenia was 41 and 18, respectively The magnitude of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia was 249, 216, and 54, respectively Lymphopenia 722 was the most common hematological abnormality COVID19 patients with severe and critical disease were more likely to develop anemia, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and combined neutrophilialymphopenia than those with moderate disease condition, with a significant association Conclusion Lymphopenia was the most common hematological abnormality observed among COVID19 patients Hematological abnormalities such as anemia, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and combined neutrophilialymphopenia were significantly associated with disease severity Monitoring and evaluation of hematological parameters could provide prognostic insight into the management and risk stratification of COVID19 patients However, further studies are required to fully understand the utility of hematological parameters for the prognosis of COVID19 disease,,,,Arterial and venous atherothrombotic events are finely regulated processes involving a complex interplay between vulnerable blood, vulnerable vessel, and blood stasis Vulnerable blood thrombogenicity comprises complex interactions between cellular components and plasma factors inflammatory, procoagulant, anticoagulant, and fibrinolytic factors The extent of thrombogenicity may determine the progression of atheroma and the clinical manifestation of atherothrombotic events, with the highest thrombogenicity in African Americans and lowest in East Asians Inherent thrombogenicity may influence clinical efficacy and safety of specific antithrombotic treatments in highrisk patients, which may in part explain the observation that East Asian patients have reduced antiischemic benefits and elevated bleeding risk with antithrombotic therapy compared to Caucasian patients In this review, we discuss available evidence regarding the racial differences in thrombogenicity and its impact on clinical outcomes among patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease,,Highsensitivity cardiac troponin hscTn assays have the ability to detect minute troponin concentrations and resolve minor changes in biomarker concentrations Clinically, this allows for the ability to rapidly identify or exclude acute myocardial injury in the setting of acute chest discomfortthus providing more rapid evaluation for acute myocardial infarctionbut the improvements in troponin assays also create avenues for other applications where troponin release from the cardiomyocyte might confer prognostic information These situations include cardiovascular risk assessment across a wide range of clinical circumstances, including apparentlywell individuals, those at risk for heart disease, and those with prevalent cardiovascular disorders The optimal hscTn threshold for each circumstance varies by the assay used and by the population assessed This review will provide context for how hscTn assays might be interpreted depending on the application sought, reviewing results from studies leveraging hscTn for applications beyond acute myocardial infarction diagnostic evaluation,,Introduction While coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 has been associated with acute ischemic stroke AIS, the causal relationship has yet to be elucidated Factors that likely confer increased stroke risk are COVID19associated coagulopathy and hyperinflammatory response Studying clinical features of patients with otherwise undetermined cause of AIS could help better define COVID19associated stroke   Methods We performed a multicenter crosssectional study of consecutive patients presenting with AIS and COVID19 to one of two large healthcare systems in New York City during the local COVID19 surge from March 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020 Inhospital stroke cases were excluded We compared demographic and clinical features of patients with COVID19 and a cryptogenic AIS subtype to patients with COVID19 and a determined subtype Baseline characteristics and clinical variables were compared using chisquared and Fisher exact tests   Results A total of 62 patients with AIS and COVID19 at the time of hospital arrival were identified Of these, 30 were classified as having a cryptogenic subtype 80 after complete diagnotics evaluation, and 32 had an identifiable stroke mechanism Patients with cryptogenic AIS were significantly younger p0011 and less likely to have comorbid hypertension p0019, coronary artery disease p0024, heart failure p0039, atrial fibrillation 00001, and prior stroke or TIA p0033 compared to those with defined mechanisms Further, ddimer, but not Creactive protein, was significantly higher in patients with cryptogenic stroke compared to those with defined causes p0009   Conclusion Patients with AIS in the setting of COVID19 and no other determined stroke mechanism were younger, less likely to have classic risk factors, and had higher ddimer levels when compared to those with a determined mechanism Further study of COVID19associated hypercoagulability as a mechanism of stroke is warranted,,,Background Intraluminal carotid thrombi ILT are uncommon and present in only 04 to 15  of patients with stroke The endothelial inflammation and hypercoagulable state associated with COVID19 caused by SARSCoV2 poses a risk of arterial and venous thromboembolism Herein, we present a series of stroke patients with ILT in the setting of a recent SARSCoV2 infection   Methods and Results From July 9 th , 2020 to August 17 th , 2020, four patients were identified with acute ischemic stroke with varying thrombus burden but similar morphological patterns of ILT All patients had evidence of recent SARSCoV2 infection as confirmed by PCR n3 or IgG antibody n1 in addition to clinical and radiological manifestations consistent with COVID19 General characteristics and imaging of the patients are shown in table 1 Mean age was 553 77 years Most patients 3 had at least two vascular risk factors and none had a central embolic source other than ILT DDimer was profoundly elevated in 3 patients ILT involved the cervical 3 and intracranial 1 internal carotid artery COVID19 symptoms ranged from mild transient respiratory symptoms to severe pneumonia requiring critical care support None of the patients received acute reperfusion therapy either due to presentation beyond the therapeutic window or due to the absence of large vessel occlusion andor unfavorable imaging profile   Conclusion In this small case series of relatively young patients with acute ischemic stroke we found an association between COVID19 infection and ILT This suggests a distinctive pathophysiological pattern of stroke in COVID19 patients Further studies are necessary to elucidate the underlying pathophysiology and target specific treatment modalities,,,Background COVID19 infection has been known to predispose patients to both arterial and venous thromboembolic events such as deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and stroke A few reports from the literature suggest that Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis CVSTs may be a direct complication of COVID19 Objective To review the clinical and radiological presentation of COVID19 positive patients diagnosed with CVST Methods This was a multicenter, crosssectional, retrospective study of patients diagnosed with CVST and COVID19 reviewed from March 1, 2020 to November 8, 2020 We evaluated their clinical presentations, risk factors, clinical management, and outcome We reviewed all published cases of CVST in patients with COVID19 infection from January 1, 2020 to November 13, 2020 Results There were 8 patients diagnosed with CVST and COVID19 during the study period at 7 out of 31 participating centers Patients in our case series were mostly female 78, 875 Most patients presented with nonspecific symptoms such as headache 50, fever 50, and gastrointestinal symptoms 75 Several patients presented with focal neurologic deficits 28, 25 or decreased consciousness 28, 25 Ddimer and inflammatory biomarkers were significantly elevated relative to reference ranges in patients with available laboratory data The superior sagittal and transverse sinuses were the most common sites for acute CVST formation 68, 75 Median time to onset of focal neurologic deficit from initial COVID19 diagnosis was 3 days interquartile range 0753 days Median time from onset of COVID19 symptoms to CVST radiologic diagnosis was 11 days interquartile range 61675 days Mortality was low in this cohort 18 or 125 Conclusions Clinicians should consider the risk of acute CVST in patients positive for COVID19, especially if neurological symptoms develop,Introduction COVID19 has been associated with venous and arterial thrombotic complications The objective of our study was to determine whether markers of coagulation and hemostatic activation MOCHA on admission could identify COVID19 patients at risk for thrombotic events   Methods COVID19 patients admitted to a tertiary academic healthcare system from April 3, 2020 to July 31, 2020 underwent admission testing of MOCHA profile parameters plasma ddimer, prothrombin fragment 12, thrombinantithrombin complex, and fibrin monomer For this analysis we excluded patients on outpatient anticoagulation therapy preceding admission Prespecified endpoints monitored during hospitalization included deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and access line thrombosis   Results During the study period, 276 patients were included in the analysis cohort mean age 59  63 years, 47 female, 83 nonwhite race Arterial and venous thrombotic events occurred in 43 16 patients see Table Each coagulation marker was independently associated with the composite endpoint p005 Admission MOCHA with  2 abnormalities was associated with the composite endpoint OR 31, 95 CI 1283, ICU admission OR 32, 95 CI 1855 and intubation OR 28, 95 CI 1555 Admission MOCHA with  2 abnormalities 26 of the cohort had sensitivity of 88 and a negative predictive value of 93 for an inhospital endpoint   Conclusion Admission MOCHA with  2 abnormalities identified COVID19 patients at risk for a thrombotic event, ICU admission and intubation while  2 abnormalities identified a subgroup of patients who were at low risk for thrombotic events Our results suggest that an admission MOCHA profile can be useful to risk stratify COVID19 patients Further studies are needed to determine whether an admission MOCHA profile can guide anticoagulation therapy and improve overall clinical outcomes,,No abstract available Article truncated after 150 words A 31yearold male fire fighter with a history of recurrent atypical pneumonia, environmental and drug allergies, nasal polyps, asthma, and Crohns disease not on immunosuppressants was transferred from an outside hospital for management of acute hypoxic respiratory failure with peripheral eosinophilia Prior to admission he reported a 2week history of worsening dyspnea, productive cough and wheezing, prompting an urgent care visit where he was prescribed amoxicillinclavulanate for suspected community acquired pneumonia Despite multiple days on this medication, his symptoms significantly worsened until he was unable to lie flat without coughing or wheezing He was ultimately admitted to an outside hospital where his labs were notable for a leukocytosis to 22,000 and peripheral eosinophilia with an absolute eosinophil count of 9700 cellsmicroL His blood cultures and urine cultures were negative, and a radiograph of the chest demonstrated bilateral nodular infiltrates With these imaging findings combined with the peripheral eosinophilia there was …,Technological innovations reach deeply into our daily lives and an emerging trend supports the use of commercial smart wearable devices to manage health In the era of remote, decentralized and increasingly personalized patient care, catalysed by the COVID19 pandemic, the cardiovascular community must familiarize itself with the wearable technologies on the market and their wide range of clinical applications In this Review, we highlight the basic engineering principles of common wearable sensors and where they can be errorprone We also examine the role of these devices in the remote screening and diagnosis of common cardiovascular diseases, such as arrhythmias, and in the management of patients with established cardiovascular conditions, for example, heart failure To date, challenges such as device accuracy, clinical validity, a lack of standardized regulatory policies and concerns for patient privacy are still hindering the widespread adoption of smart wearable technologies in clinical practice We present several recommendations to navigate these challenges and propose a simple and practical ABCD guide for clinicians, personalized to their specific practice needs, to accelerate the integration of these devices into the clinical workflow for optimal patient care,Cystic Fibrosis CF lung disease results from mutations in the CFTR anion channel that reduce anion and fluid secretion by airway epithelia Impaired secretion compromises airway innate defence mechanisms and leads to bacterial colonization, excessive inflammation and tissue damage thus, restoration of CFTR function is the goal of many CF therapies CFTR channels are activated by cyclic nucleotidedependent protein kinases The second messengers 35cAMP and 35cGMP are hydrolysed by a large family of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases that provide subcellular spatial and temporal control of cyclic nucleotidedependent signalling Selective inhibition of these enzymes elevates cyclic nucleotide levels, leading to activation of CFTR and other downstream effectors Here we examine members of the PDE family that are likely to regulate CFTRdependent ion and fluid secretion in the airways and discuss other actions of PDE inhibitors that can influence cyclic nucleotideregulated mucociliary transport, inflammation and bronchodilation Finally, we review PDE inhibitors and the potential benefits they could provide as CF therapeutics, Currently, there is a number of clinical data on the basics of lung ultrasound US examination in patients with COVID19 This article is focused on the principles of pneumonia diagnosis It is established that the use of ultrasound can be informative at the prehospital stage and triage of patients and also detection of mild forms of the course of the disease,The Corona Virus Disease 2019 COVID19, caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2, progressed rapidly since its first outbreak, and quickly developed into a pandemic Although COVID19 mostly presents with respiratory symptoms, researchers have started reporting neurologic manifestations such as cerebrovascular diseases in patients, with COVID19 as the pandemic has progressed Herein, we report a case of 38yearold female patient identified with a left common carotid artery dissection, with COVID19 Clinicians must keep in mind that COVID19 can cause vascular complications such as carotid artery dissections in the ensuing period, even after the acute phase, although there is currently a lack of sufficient evidence to identify any causal association between COVID19 and arterial dissections,Purpose The SARSCoV2 pandemic is changing healthcare delivery around the world with hospital systems experiencing a dramatic decline in patient volumes Surveying our centers heart failure HF clinic population, we aimed to understand our patients perception of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 and care delivery preferences Methods Patients with chronic HF presenting either inperson or virtually were approached to complete a ten question, anonymous, voluntary survey Acutely decompensated patients and heart transplant recipients were excluded Results 109 patients completed the survey Average age was 62  14 years, 67 were male, and 59 had HF with reduced ejection fraction HFrEF Overall, patients were worried about contracting COVID19 and believed they were prone to more severe infection given their underlying HF However, they were not hesitant to initiate healthcare contact for symptoms and preferred inperson appointments over virtual visits Although the difference did not reach statistical significance, female patients and those with HF with preserved ejection fraction HFpEF were more concerned Conclusions Patients with HF are concerned about their increased risk of contracting COVID19 However, they are actively seeking healthcare contact and prefer inperson over virtual visits,Sudden, involuntary spasm of the diaphragm associated with closure of the glottis will lead to a hiccup sound Brief episodes of hiccups are often selflimiting and may be physiologically encountered in everyday life However, prolonged attacks of hiccups are associated with significant morbidity Herein, we present a rare and interesting case of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 induced persistent hiccups in a 61yearold gentleman with no signs or symptoms of gastric pathology As the patient required less oxygen supplementation, with inflammatory markers downtrending, his hiccups improved The timeline of the symptom presentation and his response to treatment highly suggested that his hiccups were associated with COVID19 infection To the best of our knowledge, there are only two cases of persistent hiccups secondary to COVID19 that have been reported thus far Our case will add to the existing literature and highlight the potential association of COVID19 with hiccups,Aims The objective of this research is to predict the covid19 cases in India based on the machine learning approaches   Background Covid19, a respiratory disease caused by one of the coronavirus family members, has led to a pandemic situation worldwide in 2020 This virus was detected firstly in Wuhan city of China in December 2019 This viral disease has taken less than three months to spread across the globe   Objective In this paper, we proposed a regression model based on the Support Vector Machine SVM to forecast the number of deaths, the number of recovered cases, and total confirmed cases for the next 30 days   Method For prediction, the data was collected from Github and the ministry of Indias health and family welfare from March 14, 2020, to December 3, 2020 The model has been designed in Python 36 in Anaconda to forecast the forecasting value of corona trends until September 21, 2020 The proposed methodology is based on the prediction of values using SVM based regression model with polynomial, linear, rbf kernel The dataset has been divided into train and test datasets with 40 and 60 test size and verified with real data The model performance parameters were evaluated as a mean square error, mean absolute error, and percentage accuracy   Results and Conclusion The results show that the polynomial model has obtained 95 above accuracy score, linear scored above 90, and rbf scored above 85 in predicting cumulative death, conformed cases, and recovered cases,Abstract Coronavirus outbreak occurred in late 2019 and called COVID19, caused by SARSCoV2 which firstly emerged in Wuhan cityChina This virus mostly attacks the respiratory system and therefore is more likely to destroy lung tissue and cause pneumonia although lung is the target tissue but many organs of COVID 19 patients affect by virus invasion and showed numerous Physiological consequences Angiotensin converting enzyme2 ACE2 receptors for the virus attachment are distributed in humans tissues including lungs, heart, kidneys, intestines, brain and testes that are recognized as a possible targets of COVID19The vital functions of these organs may impaired with different levels as a result of viral infection and replication Patient with type A especially those formerly have been identified with cardiovascular diseases in particular increased blood pressure, are more expected to develop acute COVID19 symptoms Clot producing disorders with SARS CoV2 infected patients were observed firstly by researchers in China Thus untreated patients revealed large arterial pulmonary clots can put permanent pressure on the heart, leading to cardiac attack Anxiety about the coronavirus outbreak is extremely common Therefore, some individual may showed a huge concern that can disturb their regular life Stress and fear from infection can be devastating and cause powerful excitements in children and adults Therefore this study aims to shed light on pathophysiological consequences and stressful conditions of COVID19 in patients including many of boby organs and ABO system,BACKGROUND Given the high prevalence and risk for outcomes associated with pediatric obstructive sleep apnea OSA, there is a need for simplified diagnostic approaches A

pediatric OSA,BACKGROUND Echocardiography is fundamental in the understanding of cardiology however, echocardiography is not routinely taught in medical schools The aim of this study is to assess whether teaching echocardiography to preclinical medical students using an elearning software ELS is practical and appropriate METHODS From 2017 to 2019, 1084xa0secondyear medical students at Indiana University School of Medicine were introduced to echocardiography by using the ELS In 2017 and 2018 students had a postcourse survey to assess echocardiography appropriateness and cardiology learning Students in 2018 and 2019 were assessed for any association between the use of the ELS and learning cardiology by comparing examination scores RESULTS In 20172018, 127 students responded to the survey 18 response rate In 2017, 79 of responders and in 2018, 89 reported that introducing echocardiography to medical students is appropriate In 2017, 78 and in 2018, 87 reported that it improved the understanding of cardiology Student ELS usage was high for 20172018 93 and 70 but dropped in 2019 30 In 2018 and 2019, students who used ELS did statistically significantly better on the examination total scores 84 vs 82 Pxa0xa0008 in 2018 84 vs 81 Pxa0xa0002 in 2019 CONCLUSIONS Many 2nd year medical students felt learning echocardiography with ELS was appropriate and enhanced their learning cardiology Using echocardiography to help learn cardiology appears to be supported with an association of ELS usage and improved examination scores Our study suggests that echocardiography learning can and probably should begin in medical school,Mesenchymal stem cells MSCs have a great regenerative and immunomodulatory potential that was successfully tested in numerous preclinical and clinical studies of various degenerative, hematological and inflammatory disorders Over the last few decades, substantial immunoregulatory effects of MSC treatment were widely observed in different experimental models of asthma Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that stem cellbased treatment could become an attractive means to better suppress asthmatic airway inflammation, especially in subjects resistant to currently available antiinflammatory therapies In this review, we discuss mechanisms accounting for potent immunosuppressive properties of MSCs and the rationale for their use in asthma We describe in detail an intriguing interplay between MSCs and other crucial players in the immune system as well as lung microenvironment Finally, we reveal the potential of MSCs in maintaining airway epithelial integrity and alleviating lung remodelingGraphical abstract,Background SARSCoV2 is a new disease with some manifestations not yet wellknown Sharing experiences in this topic is crucial for the optimal management of the patients Case Presentation Left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis UEDVT due to a mediastinal mass strongly suspected of lymphoproliferative disease in a patient affected by SARSCoV2, disappearing at the resolution of the viral infection Conclusion Before proceeding to surgical biopsy, mediastinal mass in SARSCoV2 patients must be revaluated after the resolution of the infection,,Abstract  Background  Herbal medicinal products have a longstanding history of use in the therapy of common respiratory infections In the COVID19 pandemic, they may have the potential for symptom relief in nonsevere or moderate disease cases Here we describe the results derived by in vitro screening of five herbal medicinal products with regard to their potential to i interfere with the binding of the human Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2 receptor with the SARSCoV2 Spike S1 protein, ii modulate the release of the human defensin HBD1 and cathelicidin LL37 from human A549 lung cells upon Spike S1 protein stimulation and iii modulate the release of IFNγ from activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC The investigated extracts were Sinupret extract SINx, Bronchipret thymeivy BRO TE, Bronchipret thymeprimrose BRO TP, Imupret IMU, and Tonsipret TOP    Methods The inhibitory effect of the herbal medicinal products on the binding interaction of Spike S1 protein and the human ACE2 receptor was measured by ELISA The effects on intracellular IFNγ expression in stimulated human PBMCs were measured by flow cytometry Regulation on HBD1 and LL37 expression and secretion was assessed in 25d longterm cultured human lung A549 epithelial cells by RTPCR and ELISA   Results IMU and BRO TE concentrationdependently inhibited the interaction between spike protein and the ACE2 Receptor However, this effect was only observed in the cellfree assay at a concentration range which was later on determined as cytotoxic to human PBMC SINx, TOP and BRO TP significantly upregulated the intracellular expression of antiviral IFNγ from stimulated PBMC Cotreatment of A549 cells with IMU or BRO TP together with SARSCoV2 spike protein significantly upregulated mRNA expression IMU and release IMU and BRO TP of HBD1 and LL37 BRO TP   Conclusions  The in vitro screening results provide first evidence for an immune activating potential of some of the tested herbal medicinal extracts in the context of SARSCoV2 Whether these could be helpful in prevention of SARSCoV2 invasion or supportive in recovery from SARSCoV2 infection needs deeper understanding of the observations,,ABSTRACT A 55yearold male presented to the emergency department with the complaints of chest pain that started 4xa0h before presentation Pain was located over the anterior chest, 5 out of 10 intensity, with radiation to the left arm Chest xray on admission showed severe diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates concerning for COVID19 pneumonia Electrocardiogram showed inferior and lateral STsegment elevation compatible with acute inferolateral myocardial infarction Successful percutaneous coronary intervention PCI of the proximal and midright coronary artery using the balloon angioplasty and drugeluting stent was performed PostPCI stenosis was 0 with a thrombolysis in myocardial infarction TIMI flow of 3 Fiveday course of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine was completed with no improvement overall Patient received two doses of 400xa0mg of tocilizumab intravenously on hospital days 5 HD5 and 6 The patient was proned, on FiO2 100, PEEP 15xa0cm H2O, on epoprostenol sodium and paralytics and eventually received venovenous ECMO, which improved outcome,The diverse manifestations of heart failure led to complex treatment guidelines and care scenarios and therefore always require an integrated, multidisciplinary care approach Patients with chronic heart failure suffer from a large number of cardiac and noncardiac comorbidities For example, iron deficiency leads to decreased performance and exertional dyspnea and should be diagnosed Psychological screening questionnaires should be used for the early detection of psychological comorbiditiesARNI and SGLTinhibitors expand the pharmacotherapeutic possibilities and gain in importance The constant development of diagnostic possibilities and therapeutic options must be implemented consistently into the care continuum in order to have a lasting effect The challenge of interdisciplinary coordination can be significantly reduced through jointly agreed process logs eu200ag within the framework of integrated supply contracts or a Heart Failure Unit Network,Immune response dynamics in COVID19 and its severe manifestations have largely been studied in circulation Here, we examined the relationship between immune processes in the respiratory tract and circulation through longitudinal phenotypic, transcriptomic and cytokine profiling of paired airway and blood samples from patients with severe COVID19 relative to heathy controls In COVID19 airways, T cells exhibited activated, tissueresident, and protective profiles higher T cell frequencies correlated with survival and younger age Myeloid cells in COVID19 airways featured hyperinflammatory signatures and higher frequencies of these cells correlated with mortality and older age In COVID19 blood, aberrant CD163 monocytes predominated over conventional monocytes, and were found in corresponding airway samples and in damaged alveoli High levels of myeloid chemoattractants in airways suggest recruitment of these cells through a CCL2CCR2 chemokine axis Our findings provide insights into immune processes driving COVID19 lung pathology with therapeutic implications for targeting inflammation in the respiratory tract,,COVID19 is a disease with many clinical, biochemical, and radiological signs that has a predilection for the lungs, probably because of the high number of ACE2 receptors in this organ The infection of cells activates proinflammatory substances, causing diffuse alveolar damage, which is the histopathological basis of ARDS The exudative phase would manifest as groundglass opacities and consolidation, and the proliferative phase would manifest as a tendency toward a more linear morphology Both CT and PETCT findings support the inflammatory character of the lung lesions in the initial phase of the disease and in patients with mildmoderate disease Severe cases have pulmonary hypoperfusion that is likely due to abnormal alveolar ventilation and perfusion On the other hand, a prothrombotic state increases the risk of thromboembolic disease through the activation of coagulation and platelet pathways with the production of fibrin degradation products Ddimer and consumption of platelets,,,Introduction Red blood cell RBC rich vs fibrin rich clots have different mechanical properties and greater knowledge about clot composition in the context of clinical, imaging, and procedural factors in mechanical thrombectomy MT may help with procedural optimization The EXCELLENT Registry NCT03685578 is a prospective, global, multicenter, observational registry of EmboTrap as the first line MT device for large vessel occlusion LVO We present an interim analysis of clot collected per pass in the registry   Methods Five hundred thirtythree clot specimens from 376 subjects were collected by 20 sites and sent for analysis by independent Central Labs under standardized protocol Analysis was interrupted by COVID19, but the labs were fully operational as of June 2020 and on track to deliver results for 300 subjects in Q4 At the time of abstract submission, composition data for 234 clots from 163 subjects was available All available data will be presented at the time of the conference   Results Cardioembolic etiology n100 was associated with lower RBC 402 vs 472 and higher fibrin content 317 vs 267 compared to large artery disease n12 Hyperdensevessel susceptibility sign 78, 24, per independent imaging core lab corresponded to higher mean RBC content 444 vs 349 Treatment with IV tPA 60, 91 had no clear impact on clot composition 423 vs 406 RBC 304 vs 300 fibrin Notably, clots retrieved with the first 2 passes of were more RBC rich 421 vs 280 and clots retrieved in higher passes had a higher average fibrin content 355 vs 296 suggesting that higher fibrin content leads to greater refractoriness   Conclusions Clot densitysusceptibility on baseline imaging, stroke etiology and number of thrombectomy passes were associated with differential clot composition These findings may have potential implications for the development of better MT strategies,A young woman presented with an acute STsegment elevation myocardial infarction Her clinical course was complicated by cardiogenic shock and acute renal failure Workup revealed thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia A diagnosis of atypical hemolyticuremic syndrome was made on the basis of clinical and pathological findings Level of Difficulty Intermediate,Background Nonadherence to treatment recommendation, common in patients with COPD and Asthma, leads to poor disease control, frequent exacerbations and emergency room visits We studied the effect of a single home visit HV on adherence and health care utilization in a cohort of noncompliant Asthma and COPD patients Methods Patients with severe Asthma and COPD with frequent exacerbations deemed noncompliant were subjected to a single home visit by a multidisciplinary team Adherence to inhalers and office visits, and healthcare utilization were assessed a year prior to and after the home visit Results A total of 60 patients had an attempted home visit Contact was made with 36 patients during the home visits and these were subject to analyses Mean age was 60, and 61 were women Average FEV1 was 156 L 55 predicted There was a significant increase in compliance with office visits in the year following the HV as compared to the year before HV 87 vs 145 visits postHV Similarly, there was a significant reduction in the ER visits 76 visits vs 34 visits postHV, and hospital admission 39 visits vs 24 post HV and this was associated with a significant improvement in patient adherence to maintenance inhaler use  17 6 of 36 vs 53 19 of 36 Conclusion In patients with frequent exacerbations of Asthma and COPD with confirmed noncompliance, a single home visit by a multidisciplinary team improved patient adherence to inhalers and office visits and reduced healthcare utilization,Randomized clinical trials are the foundation of evidencebased medicine and central to practice guidelines and patient care decisions Nonetheless, randomized trials in heart failure HF populations have become increasingly difficult to conduct and are frequently associated with slow patient enrollment, highly selected populations, extensive data collection, and high costs The traditional model for HF trials has become particularly difficult to execute in the United States, where challenges to sitebased research have frequently led to modest US representation in global trials In this context, the TRANSFORMHF Torsemide Comparison with Furosemide for Management of Heartxa0Failure trial aims to overcome traditional trial challenges and compare the effects of torsemide versus furosemide among patients with HF in the United States Loop diuretic agents are regularly used by most patients with HF and practice guidelines recommend optimal use of diuretic agents as key to a successful treatment strategy Longtime clinical experience has contributed to dominant use of furosemide for loop diuretic therapy, although preclinical and small clinical studies suggest potential advantages of torsemide However, due to the lack of appropriately powered clinical outcome studies, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that torsemide should be routinely recommended over furosemide Given this gap in knowledge and the fundamental role of loop diuretic agents in HF care, the TRANSFORMHF trial was designed as a prospective, randomized, eventdriven, pragmatic, comparativeeffectiveness study to definitively compare the effect of a treatment strategy of torsemide versus furosemide on longterm mortality, hospitalization, and patientreported outcomes among patients with HF TRANSFORMHF ToRsemide compArisoN With furoSemide FORManagement of Heart Failure TRANSFORMHF NCT03296813,,Background Previous studies from the Low Risk TAVR LRT trial demonstrated that transcatheter aortic valve replacement TAVR is safe and feasible in lowrisk patients, with excellent 30day and 1year outcomes The objective of this study was to report clinical outcomes and the impact of 30day hypoattenuated leaflet thickening HALT on structural valve deterioration SVD 2 years after TAVR Methods The LRT trial was the first Food and Drug Administrationapproved Investigational Device Exemption trial in the United States to evaluate the safety and feasibility of TAVR in lowrisk patients with symptomatic severe tricuspid aortic stenosis AS Valve hemodynamics and SVD by echo were recorded 30 days, 1 year, and 2 years postTAVR Results The LRT trial enrolled 200 lowrisk patients to receive TAVR Their mean age was 736 years and 615 were men At 2year followup, the mortality rate was 42 the cardiovascular death rate was 16 The disabling stroke rate was 11, permanent pacemaker implantation rate was 86, and 4 patients 22 presented with endocarditis 2 between year 1 and 2 Of the 14 of TAVR subjects who had evidence of HALT at 30 days, there was no impact on valve hemodynamics, endocarditis or stroke at 2 years Conclusions TAVR for lowrisk patients with symptomatic severe tricuspid AS is safe at 2 years The presence of HALT at 30 days did not impact the early hemodynamic improvements nor the durability of the valve structure,,,Sepsis is the leading cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS in adults and carries a high mortality Utilizing a previously validated porcine model of sepsisinduced ARDS, we sought to refine our novel therapeutic technique of in vivo lung perfusion IVLP We hypothesized that 2 hours of IVLP would provide noninferior lung rehabilitation compared to 4 hours of treatment Adult swine n8 received lipopolysaccharide to develop ARDS and were placed on central venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation Animals were randomized to 2 vs 4 hours of IVLP The left pulmonary vessels were cannulated to IVLP using antegrade Steen solution After IVLP treatment, the left lung was decannulated and reperfused for 4 hours Total lung compliance and pulmonary venous gases from the right lung control and left lung treatment were sampled hourly Biochemical analysis of tissue and bronchioalveolar lavage was performed along with tissue histologic assessment Throughout IVLP and reperfusion, treated left lung PaO2FiO2 ratio was significantly higher than the right lung control in the 2hour group 3322589 vs 2644465, p001 In the 4hour group, there was no difference between treatment and control lung PaO2FiO2 ratio 2585724 vs 2532903, p058 Wettodry weight ratios demonstrated reduced edema in the treated left lungs of the 2hour group 623073 vs 728061, p003 Total lung compliance was also significantly improved in the 2hour group Two hours of IVLP demonstrated superior lung function in this preclinical model of sepsisinduced ARDS Clinical translation of IVLP may shorten duration of mechanical support and improve outcomes,,PEComas are a family of mesenchymal tumors with perivascular epithelioid cell PEC differentiation that show immunoreactivity for both melanocytic and smooth muscle markers The most common site for PEComas is the abdominopelvic cavity, specifically retroperitoneal and uterine Cardiac localization for PEComas is extremely rare and PEComas are rarely of malignant potential We present the case of a metastatic PEComa of cardiac origin in a patient initially admitted with a hemorrhagic pleural effusion The patient had metastatic pleural involvement, multiple pulmonary nodules as well as a splenic and right gluteal metastatic lesion A biopsy of the right gluteal lesion was consistent with PEComa Further analysis revealed a TFE3 gene rearrangement The patient was treated with Sirolimus and is tolerating treatment well, two months later The optimal management of cardiac PEComas is unclear in light of the rarity of this disease Complete resection appears to be the only curative approach However, if this is not feasible, systemic therapy is associated with a poor response and there is no prospective data to guide treatment We therefore proceed to review the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of this rare entity, looking at prior cases of cardiac PEComas in the English literature,Background Direct to consumer devices allow patients to record ECG and detect atrial fibrillation AF Clinical adoption of these devices has been limited due to the lack of efficient workflow Objective To assess a new care model for following patients after AF ablation that uses a smartphone ECG coupled with a novel cloudbased platform Methods This was a pilot study to describe AF detection, healthcare utilization, use of additional ECGs and cardiac monitors, and changes in anxiety after AF ablation Patients presenting 34 months after early successful AF ablation were randomized into a control group with standard clinical followup or a selfmonitoring group using smartphone ECG Kardia Mobile, KM coupled with a cloudbased platform KardiaPro, KP that alerted the physician when AF was detected and followed for 6 months Results A total of 100 patients were randomized 51 to the KMKP group and 48 to the control group 1 withdrew AF was detected in 18 patients 182, eleven 216 in the KMKP group and seven 146 in the control group p042 AF detection occurred at a median of 68 and 91 days in the KMKP and control groups respectively p093 These differences were not statistically significant Healthcare utilization and changes in anxiety were similar between the groups More patients required additional ECGs or cardiac monitors in the control group 271 compared to the KMKP group 59 p0004 Conclusions Smartphone ECG with a cloudbased platform can be incorporated into the care of post AF ablation patients without increasing anxiety and with less need for additional traditional monitors ClinicalTrialsgov number, NCT03557034,Hypertension is a major modifiable cardiovascular disease risk factor and its presence in childhood is associated with the presence and burden of atherosclerosis Moreover, hypertension tracks from childhood to adulthood and is associated with adverse cardiac changes and vascular damage that in turn are associated with premature cardiovascular disease in adulthood Therefore, the early identification and effective treatment of hypertension in children and adolescents is key in the primordial and primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, particularly for atrisk individuals, such as those with obesity, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease, among others Unfortunately, hypertension can be difficult to diagnose in children and adolescents and is as such frequently underrecognised In this Review, we provide an overview of hypertension in adolescents, with a focus on its prevalence and diagnosis, the rationale for early identification and treatment, and current knowledge gaps,Heart failure HF remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide One of the risk factors for HF is cardiac hypertrophy CH, which is frequently accompanied by cardiac fibrosis CF CH and CF are controlled by master regulators mTORC1 and TGF‐β, respectively Type‐2‐phosphatidylinositol‐5‐phosphate‐4‐kinase‐gamma Pip4k2c is a known mTORC1 regulator It is shown that Pip4k2c is significantly downregulated in the hearts of CH and HF patients as compared to non‐injured hearts The role of Pip4k2c in the heart during development and disease is unknown It is shown that deleting Pip4k2c does not affect normal embryonic cardiac development however, three weeks after TAC, adult Pip4k2c mice has higher rates of CH, CF, and sudden death than wild‐type mice In a gain‐of‐function study using a TAC mouse model, Pip4k2c is transiently upregulated using a modified mRNA modRNA gene delivery platform, which significantly improve heart function, reverse CH and CF, and lead to increased survival Mechanistically, it is shown that Pip4k2c inhibits TGFβ1 via its N‐terminal motif, Pip5k1α, phospho‐AKT 123, and phospho‐Smad3 In sum, loss‐and‐gain‐of‐function studies in a TAC mouse model are used to identify Pip4k2c as a potential therapeutic target for CF, CH, and HF, for which modRNA is a highly translatable gene therapy approach Heart failure remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide One of the risk factors for HF is cardiac hypertrophy CH, which is frequently accompanied by cardiac fibrosis CF Here, gain‐ and loss‐of‐function studies are used to identify the therapeutic role of Pip4k2c in preventing CH and CF via inhibition of mTOR and TGFβ1 pathways, respectively,With recent innovative aspiration catheters, even a large thrombus in the internal carotid artery can be removed at a high rate Though, we still sometimes have difficulty absorbing hard and large thrombus Here, we report a case in which we eliminated a massive thrombus stuck in the common carotid artery in multisteps Tremendously large thrombus trapped in the common carotid artery is extremely rare The thrombus was first loosened and deformed with balloon compression and removed with several attempts with an aspiration catheter and a stent retriever to finish it off The thrombus was much larger than the thickest balloonguide catheter and we had to pull it out and introduce it again for each time It required a lot of work but was lessinvasive and effective,,,,,,,,,Background The COVID19 pandemic has put several healthcare systems under severe pressure The present analysis investigates how the first wave of the COVID19 pandemic affected the myocardial infarction MI network of EmiliaRomagna Italy Methods Based on EmiliaRomagna mortality registry and administrative data from all the hospitals from January 2017 to June 2020, we analysed i temporal trend in MI hospital admissions ii characteristics, management, and 30day mortality of MI patients iii outofhospital mortality for cardiac cause Findings Admissions for MI declined on February 22, 2020 IRR 195, 95CI from 84 to 293, pxa0xa00001, and further on March 5, 2020 IRR 216, 95CI from 90 to 325, pxa0xa00001 The return to preCOVID19 MIrelated admission levels was observed from May 13, 2020 IRR 343, 95CI 200502, p0001 As compared to those before the pandemic, MI patients admitted during and after the first wave were younger and with fewer risk factors The 30day mortality remained in line with that expected based on previous years ratio observedexpected was 096, 95CI 084108 MI patients positive for SARSCoV2 were few 15 but showed poor prognosis around 5fold increase in 30day mortality In 2020, the number of outofhospital cardiac deaths was significantly higher ratio observedexpected 117, 95CI 108127 The peak was reached in April Interpretation In EmiliaRomagna, MI hospitalizations significantly decreased during the first wave of the COVID19 pandemic Management and outcomes of hospitalized MI patients remained unchanged, except for those with SARSCoV2 infection A concomitant increase in the outofhospital cardiac mortality was observed Funding None,This is the second annual review in the Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia to cover highlights in coagulation for cardiac surgery The goal of this article is to provide readers with a focused of the prior years most important coagulation topics from the literature In 2020, this includes a discussion covering allogeneic transfusion, antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy, factor concentrates, coagulation testing, mechanical circulatory support, and the impact of COVID19,,Background The COVID19 pandemic has promoted adaptations in diagnostic algorithms We explored the feasibility and accuracy of delayed phase DP chest computed tomography CT performed immediately after brain CT perfusion CTP for the identification of thrombotic complications and myocardial fibrosis among patients admitted with acute ischemic stroke AIS   Methods Since July, we have incorporated the use of low dose chest CT scans using a spectral CT scanner in all patients admitted with AIS, encouraging acquisitions, five min after brain CTP All scans were non gated and comprised low dose chest CT scans, without additional contrast Using virtual monochromatic imaging and iodine maps, we evaluated the presence of thrombotic complications, myocardial late enhancement, and myocardial extracellular volume ECV, as a surrogate of edema and interstitial fibrosis   Results We included 22 patients The mean age was 662196 years In 5 patients, a cardioembolic CE source was later identified by transesophageal echocardiogram TEE, left atrial appendage LAA thrombus, n1, transthoracic echocardiogram with agitated saline injection patent foramen ovale n2, or by EKG atrial fibrillation Seven patients further underwent either TEE or cardiac CT to identify CE sources DP non gated chest CT had a sensitivity and specificity of 100 to identify CE sources, 1 LAA thrombus correctly detected Chest CT identified pulmonary thromboembolism PE, later confirmed with CT angiography Chest CT identified myocardial late enhancement in 16 patients 80 in CE vs 71 in non CE, p068, myocardial fat in 1, and coronary calcification in 77 with 2622 vs 3836 coronary calcified segments in CE vs non CE strokes, p036 The mean ECV was 354 in CE vs 326 in non CE strokes p017 The 2 patients with a positive PCR test for COVID19 showed evidence of myocardial late iodine enhancement, and incremented ECV of the septal wall 38 and 40, respectively   Conclusions In this pilot study, DP, non ECG gated, low dose chest CT scan performed 5 min after brain CTP with a spectral scanner enabled straightforward identification of CE sources among patients with AIS This approach allowed detection of PE and myocardial injury,Cardiac arrest is an important public health concern, affecting an estimated 356,500 people in the outofhospital setting and 209,000 people in the inhospital setting each year The causes of cardiac arrest include acute coronary syndromes, pulmonary embolism, dyskalemia, respiratory failure, hypovolemia, sepsis, and poisoning among many others In order to tackle the enormous issue of high mortality among sufferers of cardiac arrest, ongoing research has been seeking improved treatment protocols and novel therapies One of the mechanical devices that has been increasingly utilized for cardiac arrest is venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation VAECMO Presently there is only one published randomized controlled trial examining the use of VAECMO as part of cardiopulmonary resuscitation CPR, a process referred to as extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation ECPR Recently there has been significant progress in providing ECPR for refractory cardiac arrest patients This narrative review seeks to outline the use of ECPR for both inhospital and outofhospital cardiac arrest, as well as provide information on the expected outcomes associated with its use,,The diagnostic evaluation of embolic stroke of undetermined source ESUS requires investigation of paradoxical embolism via shunts ESUS evaluation involves a transthoracic echocardiogram TTE with saline contrast study, then a transesophageal echocardiogram TEE for further evaluation of a patent foramen ovale PFO, as TTE lacks sensitivity PFO closure is offered for significant shunts TEE is the gold standard but transcranial doppler TCD may help in the ESUS algorithm for shunts TCD reduces procedural and anesthetic risk to patients, may be costeffective, and mitigates risk to providers during the COVID19 pandemic 12 Studies have shown the accuracy of TCD with microbubble for the diagnosis of shunts compared to TEE a recent metaanalysis found weighted average sensitivity and specificity of 97 and 93, respectively 3 We propose introducing TCD into the algorithm to evaluate ESUS as a screening tool with similar fidelity to TEE According to our algorithm, patients under the age of 60 years with ESUS will undergo TTE with microbubble, then those at low risk of valvular disease or cardiac structural pathology will undergo TCDemboli protocol Patients with grade 02 shunts will receive medical therapy, while shunt grades 35 will be referred for intraoperative TEE and closure We reviewed records of a TCDemboli protocol followed by TEE from 20142020 to ensure similar validity to published data The sensitivity and specificity of shunt detection amongst 34 patients with ESUS was 947 CI 739  999 and 933 681998, respectively Costbenefit analysis of patients who received TCD prior to TEE was calculated as the average cost difference We calculated a conservative estimate of 27413649 in cost reduction per patient, excluding the cost of TEE anesthesia In conclusion, TCDemboli protocol is a costeffective and safe screening tool with high accuracy in comparison to TEE in the diagnostic evaluation of ESUS,,Background and Purpose Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the importance of time to endovascular therapy EVT on clinical outcomes in large vessel occlusion LVO acute ischemic stroke Delays to treatment are particularly prevalent when patients require a transfer from hospitals without EVT capability onsite A novel computer aided triage system, Viz LVO, has the potential to streamline workflows This platform includes an image viewer, communication system, and an artificial intelligence AI algorithm that automatically identifies suspected LVO strokes on CTA imaging and rapidly triggers alerts We hypothesize that the Viz application will decrease timetotreatment   Methods A prospective database was assessed for patients who presented to a stroke center utilizing Viz LVO in the Mount Sinai Health System in New York and underwent EVT following transfer for LVO stroke between July 2018 and March 2020 This time period was chosen due to the COVID19 pandemic affecting stroke workflow after March 2020 Time intervals were compared for 55 patients divided into Pre and PostViz cohorts   Results The median initial doortoneuroendovascular team NT notification time interval was significantly faster 250 minutes IQR120 vs 400 minutes IQR610 p001 with significantly less variation p005 The median initial doortoskin puncture time interval was 25 minutes shorter in the PostViz cohort, although not statistically significant p015 Post Viz LVO implementation, the Viz notification was the first NT notification 38 1026 of the time   Conclusions Our preliminary results have shown that Viz LVO implementation is associated with earlier, more consistent NT notification times and potentially treatment times This platform presents a novel application of AI that can serve as an early warning system and a failsafe to ensure that no LVO is left behind Further studies are warranted,,,Abstract COVID19 has spread throughout the world causing a significant number of cases of pneumonia and SARS Patients with COVID19 may also have other cardiovascular, respiratory, and neuromuscular disorders These multisystemic complications present the need for comprehensive interventions focused on improving symptoms, functional capacity, and quality of life Pulmonary rehabilitation has the potential to offer some of these benefits However, the evidence related to specific aspects of pulmonary rehabilitation evaluation and intervention in COVID19 is limited We have learned from experiences with other types of chronic lung diseases that have used pulmonary rehabilitation successfully While the evidence of rehabilitation emerges in COVID19, it is necessary to establish some initial recommendations, prepared according to the sequelae found until now,BACKGROUND The clinical benefits of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation are extensive, including improvements in healthrelated qualityoflife, emotional condition, physical function, and overall mortality The coronavirus 2019 pandemic continues to negatively impact centerbased cardiopulmonary rehabilitation There is justifiable concern that the exerciserelated increase in pulmonary ventilation within the rehabilitation classes may lead to the generation of infectious respiratory particles RESEARCH QUESTION Is cardiopulmonary rehabilitation while wearing a procedural mask a particle generating procedure STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Data were collected prospectively at a cardiopulmonary rehabilitation facility with all patients wearing a procedural mask Small 0349μm and large 510μm particle generation was quantified using a light scattering particle counter Data was analyzed by time, exertion level, and number of participants RESULTS A total of 24 distinct patients attended 2 of the cardiopulmonary rehabilitation classes tested The majority of the patients were male n16 67 and were in rehabilitation because of cardiac disease During the cardiopulmonary rehabilitation class, small and large micronsized particles increased with increasing class size In classes with 4 patients, there was a significant increase from ambient levels in both small 4 patients p001 and 5 patients p001 and large 4 patients p001 and 5 patients p001 particle count that peaked at about 3540 minutes during each class INTERPRETATION Using an airborne particle counter, we found significant exercise related increases in both small and large micronsized particle generation during cardiopulmonary rehabilitation classes, with larger class sizes ie more patients, despite wearing a procedural mask,Background Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ACE2 is the main cellular receptor for entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 and acts as a proinflammatory mediator of Coronavirus disease COVID19 The clinical outcome of SARSCoV2 infection is influenced by proinflammatory mediators The specific microRNAs miRNAs influence the ACE2 expression and are accountable for the increased circulatory proinflammatory mediator levels Thus host factors play a crucial role in COVID19 pathophysiology The pathogenesis of COVID19 disease is not well understood Hence we comprehended the role of miRNAs, proinflammatory cytokines and ACE2 in COVID19 pathophysiology   Methods We utilized multiple databases, specifically, EMBASE, PubMed Medline and Google Scholar for our search   Discussion SARSCoV2 genes could be target of host miRNAs The miRNAs regulate the expression of ACE2 in various organs including kidney, heart, blood vessels, and lung ACE2 acts as a proinflammatory mediator of SARSCoV2 associated disease Proinflammatory cytokines IL6, IL1β and TNF have been associated with severe COVID19 disease Hence variation in expression of miRNAs would influence the regulation of COVID19 pathophysiology The clinical outcomes of COVID 19 are variable which could be linked with the difference in binding of host miRNA to target genes   Conclusion Correlation of these genes with severe or critical stages of patients will provide biomarkers for severity of lung inflammation which would be useful in rapid identification of patients in need of hospital admission Analysis of relationship between the miRNAs and ACE2 will be helpful in designing antimiR therapy for ACE2related SARSCoV2 infection,Patients who have recovered from COVID19 show persistent symptoms and lung function alterations with a restrictive ventilatory pattern Few data are available evaluating an extended period of COVID19 clinical progression The RESPICOVID study has been designed to evaluate patients pulmonary damage previously hospitalised for interstitial pneumonia due to COVID19 We focused on the arterial blood gas ABG analysis variables due to the initial observation that some patients had hypocapnia arterial partial carbon dioxide pressurePaCO2  35 mmHg Therefore, we aimed to characterise patients with hypocapnia compared to patients with normocapnia PaCO2  35 mmHg Data concerning demographic and anthropometric variables, clinical symptoms, hospitalisation, lung function and gasanalysis were collected Our study comprised 81 patients, of whom 19 24 had hypocapnia as compared to the remaining n  62, 76, and defined by lower levels of PaCO2, serum bicarbonate HCO3, carbon monoxide diffusion capacity DLCO, and carbon monoxide transfer coefficient KCO with an increased level of pH and arterial partial oxygen pressure PaO2 KCO was directly correlated with PaCO2 and inversely with pH In our preliminary report, hypocapnia is associated with a residual lung function impairment in diffusing capacity We focus on ABG analysiss informativeness in the followup of postCOVID patients,A 26 year old female presented with complaints of high grade fever and cough for 10 days Nasopharyngeal swab tested for COVID19 RTPCR at admission was negative Clinical examination suggested a patch of bronchial breathing in left infrascapular region and bilateral diffuse rhonchi Chest Xray was suggestive of left lower zone consolidation HRCT showed a large patch of consolidation with GGO along with a cavitary lesion involving left lower lobe Sputum for RTPCR COVID 19 was positive Patient was managed as per covid19 protocol, subsequently showing clinical and radiological improvement,Tobacco smoking has emerged as a risk factor for increasing the susceptibility to infection from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 via increased expression of angiotensinconverting enzyme2 ACE2 in the lung, linked to coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 development Given the modifiable nature of electronic cigarettes and the delivery of high concentrations of nicotine, we investigate whether electronic cigarette vaping has the potential to increase susceptibility to SARSCoV2 infection We exposed BEAS2B cells bronchial epithelium transformed with Ad12SV40 2B and primary small airway epithelial cells SAECs to electronic cigarette aerosol condensates produced from propylene glycolvegetable glycerin or commercially bought eliquid added nicotine and cigarette smoke extract to investigate if electronic cigarette exposure, like cigarette smoke, increases the expression of ACE2 in lung epithelial cells In BEAS2B cells, cytotoxicity CCK8, membrane integrity LDH, and ACE2 protein expression immunofluorescence were measured for both 4 and 24 h treatments in BEAS2B cells and 4 h in SAECs ACE2 gene expression was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction qPCR for 4 h treatment in BEAS2B cells Nicotinefree condensates and higher concentrations of nicotinecontaining condensates were cytotoxic to BEAS2B cells Higher LDH release and reduced membrane integrity were seen in BEAS2B cells treated for 24 h with higher concentrations of nicotinecontaining condensates ACE2 protein expression was observably increased in all treatments compared to cell controls, particularly for 24 h exposures ACE2 gene expression was significantly increased in cells exposed to the locally bought eliquid condensate with high nicotine concentration and cigarette smoke extract compared with cell controls Our study suggests that vaping alone and smoking alone can result in an increase in lung ACE2 expression Vaping and smoking are avoidable risk factors for COVID19, which, if avoided, could help reduce the number of COVID19 cases and the severity of the disease This is the first study to utilize electronic cigarette aerosol condensates, novel and developed in our laboratory, for investigating ACE2 expression in human airway epithelial cells,Inflammation can cause a series of inflammatory lung disease, which seriously endangers human health Pulmonary fibrosis is a kind of inflammatory disease with endstage lung pathological changes It has complicated and unknown pathogenesis and is still lack of effective therapeutic drugs LPSinduced inflammation is a common feature of many infectious inflammations such as pneumonia, bacteremia, glomerulonephritis, etc Evodiamine, one of the main components of Evodia rutaecarpa, is an alkaloid with excellent antiinflammatory effects In this study, we evaluated the protective capacities of evodiamine on LPSinduced inflammatory damages in vitro and in vivo MTT method, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and other methods were used for in vitro study to determine the protective capacities of evodiamine The results suggest that evodiamine can protect murine macrophages from the LPSnigericininduced damages by a inhibiting cellular apoptosis, b inhibiting inflammatory cytokines releasing, and c activating the apelin pathway We also used the exogenous apelin13 peptide cocultured with LPSnigericin in RAW2647 cells and found that apelin13 contributes to protecting the effects of evodiamine In vivo, the ELISA method and immunohistochemistry were used to examine inflammatory cytokines, apelin, and histological changes BALBc mice were exposed to LPS and subsequent administration of evodiamine pofor some time, the results of the alveolar lavage fluid and the tissue slices showed that evodiamine treatment alleviated the pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, stimulated apelin expression and inhibited the inflammatory cytokines These results provide a basis for the protective effect and mechanism of evodiamine in LPSinduced inflammation and suggest that it might be potential therapeutics in human pulmonary infections,BACKGROUND Adults in rural counties in the United States US experience higher rates broadly of cardiovascular disease CVD compared with adults in urban counties Mortality rates specifically due to heart failure HF have increased since 2011, but estimates of heterogeneity at the countylevel in HFrelated mortality have not been produced The objectives of this study were 1 to quantify nationwide trends by ruralurban designation and 2 examine countylevel factors associated with ruralurban differences in HFrelated mortality rates METHODS AND FINDINGS We queried CDC WONDER to identify HF deaths between 20112018 defined as CVD I0078 as the underlying cause of death and HF I50 as a contributing cause of death First, we calculated national ageadjusted mortality rates AAMR and examined trends stratified by ruralurban status defined using 2013 NCHS UrbanRural Classification Scheme, age 3564 and 6584 years, and racesex subgroups per year Second, we combined all deaths from 20112018 and estimated incidence rate ratios IRR in HFrelated mortality for rural versus urban counties using multivariable negative binomial regression models with adjustment for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, risk factor prevalence, and physician density Between 20112018, 162,314 and 580,305 HFrelated deaths occurred in rural and urban counties, respectively AAMRs were consistently higher for residents in rural compared with urban counties 732 95 CI 722742 vs 572 568576 in 2018, respectively The highest AAMR was observed in rural Black men 1311 12331389 in 2018 with greatest increases in HFrelated mortality in those 3564 years 61year The ruralurban IRR persisted among both younger 110 104116 and older adults 104 102107 after adjustment for countylevel factors Main limitations included lack of individuallevel data and county dropout due to low event rates 20 CONCLUSIONS Differences in countylevel factors may account for a significant amount of the observed variation in HFrelated mortality between rural and urban counties Efforts to reduce the ruralurban disparity in HFrelated mortality rates will likely require diverse public health and clinical interventions targeting the underlying causes of this disparity,Abstract  Purpose Lowdose whole lung radiotherapy LDLR has been proposed as a treatment for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with SARSCoV2 infection and clinical trials are underway There is an urgent need for preclinical evidence to justify this approach and inform dose, scheduling and mechanisms of action   Materials and methods Female C57BL6 mice were treated with intranasal bleomycin sulphate 75 or 1125 unitskg, day 0, then exposed to whole lung radiation therapy 05, 10, 15 Gy or sham, day 3 Bodyweight was measured daily and lung tissue harvested for histology and flow cytometry on day 10 Computed tomography CT lung imaging was performed preradiation day 3 and preendpoint day 10   Results Bleomycin caused pneumonitis of variable severity which correlated with weight loss LDLR at 10 Gy was associated with a significant increase in the proportion of mice recovering to 98 of initial bodyweight and a proportion of these mice exhibited less severe histopathological lung changes Mice experiencing moderate initial weight loss were more likely to respond to LDLR than those experiencing severe initial weight loss Additionally, LDLR 10 Gy significantly reduced bleomycininduced increases in interstitial macrophages, CD103 dendritic cells and neutrophilDC hybrids Overall,bleomycintreated mice exhibited significantly higher percentages of nonaerated lung in left than right lungs and LDLR 10 Gy prevented further reductions in aerated lung volume in right but not left lungs LDLR at 05 and 15 Gy did not modulate bodyweight or flow cytometric readouts of bleomycininduced pneumonitis   Conclusions Our data support the concept that LDLR can ameliorate acute inflammatory lung injury, identify 10 Gy as the most effective dose and provide preliminary evidence that it is more effective in the context of moderate than severe pneumonitis Mechanistically, LDLR at 10 Gy significantly suppressed bleomycininduced accumulation of pulmonary interstitial macrophages, CD103 dendritic cells and neutrophilDC hybrids,One patient presented with an acute right upper extremity ischemia axillary artery thrombosis and the other with a symptomatic popliteal artery aneurysm 75x72cm Both patients tested positive for Covid19 but had no systemic symptoms The patients were successfully managed using percutaneous techniques and subsequently discharged on oral anticoagulation A review of the pathogenesis of SARSCoV2 related arterial thrombosis and aneurysmal disease are discussed,Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 While the majority of symptoms and morbidity relate to the lung, cardiac complications have been well reported and confer increased mortality Many countries in Europe have passed the peak of the pandemic and adaptations are being made as we progress towards a new normal As part of this, governments have been planning strategies for the return of elite sports This article summarises the potential implications of COVID19 for athletes returning to sport, including common cardiac complications of the disease consensus recommendations for the return to sport after having COVID19 and international recommendations for the management of cardiac pathology that may occur as a result of COVID19 The authors also examine the potential overlap of pathology with physiological change seen in athletes hearts,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome due to Coronavirus19 SARSCoV2 is caused by combined alveolarcapillary lung damage, with bilateral pneumonia and thrombosis, which often causes respiratory failure Proper COVID19 management requires high skills in airway control and the need to perform aerosolgenerating procedures such as bronchoscopy, which can increase the possibility of virus spreading among healthcare professionals In an epidemiologically delicate moment, the multidisciplinary decision on WHEN, HOW and WHY to perform bronchoscopies minimizing the risk of COVID19 transmission, represented a great challenge for all specialists engaged in bronchoscopic procedures In this work authors want to share all technical aspects of 87 videobronchoscopies performed in confirmed or suspected COVID19 patients, from 3rd to 6th January 2020, describing the reason, the organizational and operational model and patients characteristics Was also evaluated the impact of highrisk procedures such as bronchoscopy on the personnel involved The disclosure of all technical details, represents, in the opinion of the authors, an important contribution, capable of providing support to all physicians engaged in bronchoscopy procedures in confirmed or suspected COVID19 patients,OBJECTIVE The evidence pertaining to the effects of asthma on Coronavirus disease 2019 outcomes has been unclear To improve our understanding of the clinically important association of asthma and Coronavirus disease 2019 METHODS A matched cohort study was performed using data from the Mass General Brigham Health Care System Boston, MA Adult age 18u2009years patients with confirmed Coronavirus disease 2019 and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, or interstitial lung disease between March 4, 2020 and July 2, 2020 were analyzed Up to five nonasthma comparators were matched to each asthma patient based on age within 5u2009years, sex, and date of positive test within 7u2009days The primary outcomes were hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and death, using multivariable Coxproportional hazards models accounting for competing risk of death, when appropriate Patients were followed for these outcomes from diagnosis of Coronavirus disease 2019 until July 2, 2020 RESULTS Among 562 asthma patients, 199 21 were hospitalized, 15 3 received mechanical ventilation, and 7 1 died Among the 2686 matched comparators, 487 18 were hospitalized, 107 4 received mechanical ventilation, and 69 3 died The adjusted Hazard Ratios among asthma patients were 099 95 Confidence Internal 080, 122 for hospitalization, 069 95 Confidence Internal 036, 129 for mechanical ventilation, and 030 95 Confidence Internal 011, 080 for death CONCLUSIONS In this matched cohort study from a large Bostonbased healthcare system, asthma was associated with comparable risk of hospitalization and mechanical ventilation but a lower risk of mortality,INTRODUCTION COVID19 has caused a great deal of fear indifferent communities In this study, we reported the recovery of a diabetic elderly woman with a history of asthmafromCOVID19 infection CASE PRESENTATION A 61yearold woman was hospitalized due to dyspnea and low blood O2 saturation and later diagnosed with COVID19, as confirmed by PCR The patient had a history of asthma and diabetes and used salbutamol and Atrovent spray She also had a history of hospitalization at one month prior to the current admission Despite all these, COVID19was successfully managed, and she was discharged with a good clinical condition after the improvement of respiratory complications CONCLUSION Despite having an advanced age and underlying diseases diabetes and asthma, the recovery of this elderly woman shows that even such patientscandefeatCOVID19 as long as the disease is not progressed to advanced phases and appropriate therapeutic measures are taken By reporting such cases, it is possible to give people hope and motivation and reduce their fear of the disease,BackgroundComputed tomography angiography CTA of the head and neck during acute ischemic stroke AIS usually includes visualization of lung apices The possibility to evaluate for pulmonary changes, eg peripheral groundglass and consolidative opacities suggestive of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19related pneumonia, depends on the area of the lung covered by CTAMethodsWe performed an analysis of a realworld scenario assessing the variability of lung coverage on CTA in patients presenting with AIS to a comprehensive stroke center CSC or to one of eight primary stroke centers PSC within a teleradiological network covered by the comprehensive stroke center in 2019ResultsOur final analysis included nxa0u2009940 CTA, and in nxa0u2009573 61 merely lung apices were covered In 19940 2 of patients no lung tissue was covered by CTA CTA scanning protocols in the CSC began significantly more frequently at the level of the ascending aorta CSC nxa0u2009180 382, PSC nxa0u2009127 271, pvalue,BackgroundSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection can lead to a constellation of viral and immune symptoms called coronavirus disease 2019 Emerging literature increasingly supports the premise that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 promotes a prothrombotic milieu However, to date there have been no reports of acute aortic occlusion, itself a rare phenomenon We report a case of fatal acute aortic occlusion in a patient with coronavirus disease 2019Case reportA 59yearold Caucasian male with past medical history of peripheral vascular disease presented to the emergency department for evaluation of shortness of breath, fevers, and dry cough His symptoms started 57 days prior to the emergency department visit, and he received antibiotics in the outpatient setting without any effect He was found to be febrile, tachypneic, and hypoxemic He was placed on supplemental oxygen via a nonrebreather mask Chest Xray showed multifocal opacifications Intravenous antibiotics for possible pneumonia were initiated Hydroxychloroquine was initiated to cover possible coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia During the hospitalization, the patient became progressively hypoxemic, for which he was placed on bilevel positive airway pressure Ddimer, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and Creactive protein were all elevated Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was positive On day 3, the patient was upgraded to the intensive care unit Soon after he was intubated, he developed a mottled appearance of skin, which extended from his bilateral feet up to the level of the subumbilical plane Bedside ultrasound revealed an absence of flow from the midaorta to both common iliac arteries The patient was evaluated emergently by vascular surgery After a discussion with the family, it was decided to proceed with comfortdirected care, and the patient died later that dayDiscussionViral infections have been identified as a source of prothrombotic states due to direct injury of vascular tissue and inflammatory cascades Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 appears to follow a similar pattern, with numerous institutions identifying elevated levels of thrombotic complications We believe that healthcare providers should be aware of both venous and arterial thrombotic complications associated with coronavirus disease 2019, including possible fatal outcome,Introduction and objectives Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 Atrial fibrillation AF is common in acute situations, where it is associated with more complications and higher mortalityMethods Analysis of the international HOPE registry NCT04334291 The objective was to assess the prognostic information of AF in COVID19 patients A multivariate analysis and propensity score matching were performed to assess the relationship between AF and mortality We also evaluated the impact on mortality and embolic events of the CHA2DS2VASc score in these patientsResults Among 6217 patients enrolled in the HOPE registry, 250 had AF 45 AF patients had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities After propensity score matching, these differences were attenuated Despite this, patients with AF had a higher incidence of inhospital complications such as heart failure 193 vs 116, Pu2009u2009021 and respiratory insufficiency 759 vs 623, Pu2009u2009002, as well as a higher 60day mortality rate 434 vs 309, Pu2009u2009005 On multivariate analysis, AF was independently associated with higher 60day mortality hazard ratio, 1234 95CI, 10031519 CHA2DS2VASc score acceptably predicts 60day mortality in COVID19 patients area ROC, 0748 95CI, 07330764, but not its embolic risk area ROC, 0411 95CI, 01470675Conclusions AF in COVID19 patients is associated with a higher number of complications and 60day mortality The CHA2DS2VASc score may be a good risk marker in COVID patients but does not predict their embolic risk,,Since the appearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2, the question regarding the efficacy of various hygiene measures and the use of personal protective equipment PPE has become the focus of scientific and above all public discussion To compare respirators, medical face masks, and cloth masks and determine if it is recommendable to wear face masks to protect the individual wearer of the mask from inhaling airborne particles, we challenged 29 different masks with aerosols and tested the pressure drop as a surrogate for breathing resistance owing to the mask material We found that Type II medical face masks showed the lowest pressure drop 12968 Pacm2 and therefore additional breathing resistance, whereas respirators such as the KN95 32370 Pacm2 and FFP2 26874 Pacm2 showed the highest pressure drops among the tested masks The filtration efficacy of the mask material was the lowest for cloth masks 2825 followed by noncertified face masks 6319 and certified medical face masks 7010 The materials of the different respirators showed very high aerosol retentions KN95 944 and FFP2 981 For evaluating the asworn filtration performance simulating real live conditions each mask type was also tested on a standardized dummy head Cloth masks and nonENcertified face masks had the worst asworn filtration efficacies among the tested masks, filtering less than 20 of the test aerosol Remarkably, certified type II medical face masks showed similar p05 asworn filtration results 4720 than KN95 masks 414 and FFP2 masks 6527, despite having a lower pressure drop Face shields did not show any significant retention function against aerosols in our experiment Our results indicate that it seems recommendable to wear face masks for providing base protection and risk reduction against inhaling airborne particles, in lowrisk situations In our study, especially EN 14683 type II certified medical face masks showed protective effectiveness against aerosols accompanied by minimal additional breathing resistance FFP2 Respirators, on the other hand, could be useful in highrisk situations but require greater breathing effort and therefore physical stress for users,,In December 2019, the World Health Organization WHO announced a series of pneumonia cases caused by an unknown origin, discovered in Wuhan, China A dangerous virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 caused a disease named acute respiratory syndrome, which was later popularly called coronavirus infection COVID19 Patients with acute COVID19 are at high risk of thrombosis in various blood vessels due to hypercoagulability, blood stasis, and endothelial damage In this study, we present a case report of a patient with COVID19, who was hospitalized in one of the hospitals in Sanandaj, Iran There were symptoms of fever, chills, muscle aches, cough, and tachycardia Laboratory tests showed high levels of CRP, ESR, Ferritin CLIA, LDH and DDimer in this patient Doppler ultrasound of the patient also revealed an abnormal finding, thrombosis in the right greater saphenous vein This suggests that COVID19 may lead to other negative effects through damage to blood vessels,We retrospectively collected clinical data on 31 relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia RR AML patients who were treated with outpatient glasdegib and lowdose Cytarabine LDAraC at our institution The median age was 67 years 4586 The median Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 2 13 The patients had previously received a median number of 2 14 treatment lines, 61 1931 had been treated with intensive chemotherapy, 29 931 had relapsed after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, and 45 1431 had had venetoclax exposure Adverse cytogenetics were identified in 45 1431 of the cases The CR  CRp rate was 21 629 among evaluable patients The median overall survival was 39 months for all patients Different median overall survival times were observed in responders, patients achieving stable disease and those diagnosed with progressive disease not reached vs 39 months vs 08 months, respectively p  0001 The most common adverse events were pneumonia 29, 931, sepsis 23, 731, and febrile neutropenia 16, 531 Glasdegib  LDAraC is a fairly safe, nonintensive, outpatient regimen inducing complete remission and resulting in prolonged survival in some RR AML patients,Background and Objectives The potential role of lung ultrasound LUS in characterizing lung involvement in Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is still debated The aim of the study was to estimate sensitivity of admission LUS for the detection of SARSCoV2 lung involvement using ChestCT Computed Tomography as reference standard in order to assess LUS usefulness in ruling out COVID19 pneumonia in the Emergency Department ED Methods Eightytwo patients with confirmed COVID19 and signs of lung involvement on ChestCT were consecutively admitted to our hospital and recruited in the study ChestCT and LUS examination were concurrently performed within the first 612h from admission Sensitivity of LUS was calculated using CT findings as a reference standard Results Global LUS sensitivity in detecting COVID19 pulmonary lesions was 52 LUS sensitivity ranged from 8 in case of focal and sporadic groundglass opacities mild disease, to 52 for a crazypaving pattern moderate disease and up to 100 in case of extensive subpleural consolidations severe disease, although LUS was not always able to detect all the consolidations assessed at ChestCT LUS sensitivity was higher in detecting a typical ChestCT pattern 60 and abnormalities showing a middlelower zone predominance 79 Conclusions As admission LUS may result falsely negative in most cases, it should not be considered as a reliable imaging tool in ruling out COVID19 pneumonia in patients presenting in ED It may at least represent an expanded clinical evaluation that needs integration with other diagnostic tests eg, nasopharyngeal swab, ChestCT,AIMS Lymphopenia after STsegment elevation myocardial infarction STEMI correlates with deleterious cardiac consequences and worse prognosis An indepth examination of genes implicated in lymphocyte proliferation, activation and regulation and their association with short and longterm cardiac structure and function is therefore of great interest METHODS Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 10 control subjects and 64 patients with a first STEMI treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention and submitted to cardiac magnetic resonance after 1xa0week and 6xa0months mRNA expression of genes implicated in lymphocyte activation CD25 and CD69 and regulation programmed death PD1 and cytotoxic Tlymphocyte antigen CTLA4 were determined by qRTPCR RESULTS In comparison to controls, STEMI patients showed heightened mRNA expression of CD25 and lower PD1 and CTLA4 96xa0h after coronary reperfusion Patients with extensive infarctions 30 of left ventricular mass at 1xa0week displayed a notable reduction in CD25, CD69, PD1, and CTLA4 expression p,Background Pulmonary rehabilitation PR is a costeffective management strategy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD which improves exercise performance and healthrelated quality of life Nutritional supplementation may counter malnutrition and enhance PR outcomes but rigorous evidence is absent We aimed to investigate the effect of high proteinsupplementation Fortisip Compact Protein, FCP during PR on exercise capacity   Methods A doubleblind randomised controlled trial comparing FCP with preOp a carbohydrate control supplement in COPD patients participating in a PR programme Participants consumed the supplement twice a day during PR and attended twiceweekly PR sessions, with pre and postPR measurements including the incremental shuttle walk test ISWT at 6weeks as the primary outcome Participants experience using supplements was assessed   Results  Sixtyeight patients were recruited FCP 36 and control 32 The trial was stopped early due to COVID19 Although statistical significance was not reached, there was the suggestion of a clinically meaningful difference in ISWT at 6 weeks favouring the intervention group intervention 342 m149 n22 versus control 305 m148 n22, p01 Individuals who achieved an improvement in ISWT had larger midthigh circumference at baseline responder 62 cm4 versus nonresponder 55 cm6 p0006 79 were satisfied with the taste and 43 would continue taking the FCP    Conclusion Although the data did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in ISWT, high protein supplementation in COPD during PR may result in a clinically meaningful improvement in exercise capacity and was acceptable to patients Large, adequately powered studies are justified,Saphenous vein graft aneurysm is an uncommon condition and

viable therapeutic option in the case of saphenous vein graft aneurysms Saphenous vein graft aneurysm is an uncommon condition and knowledge about its natural history, and a multi‐specialty heart team approach is of utmost importance for better clinical outcomes This case highlights importance of percutaneous intervention as a viable therapeutic option in the case of saphenous vein graft aneurysms,Cardiovascular diseases CVDs still represent the primary cause of mortality worldwide Preclinical modeling by recapitulating human pathophysiology is fundamental to advance the comprehension of these diseases and propose effective strategies for their prevention, diagnosis, and treatment In silico, in vivo, and in vitro models have been applied to dissect many cardiovascular pathologies Computational and bioinformatic simulations allow developing algorithmic disease models considering all known variables and severity degrees of disease In vivo studies based on small or large animals have a long tradition and largely contribute to the current treatment and management of CVDs In vitro investigation with twodimensional cell culture demonstrates its suitability to analyze the behavior of single, diseased cellular types The introduction of induced pluripotent stem cell technology and the application of bioengineering principles raised the bar toward in vitro threedimensional modeling by enabling the development of pathological tissue equivalents This review article intends to describe the advantages and disadvantages of past and present modeling approaches applied to provide insights on some of the most relevant congenital and acquired CVDs, such as rhythm disturbances, bicuspid aortic valve, cardiac infections and autoimmunity, cardiovascular fibrosis, atherosclerosis, and calcific aortic valve stenosis,BACKGROUND The lockdown imposed by the COVID19 pandemic resulted in a completely different style of life with possible effects on the attitude toward their disease in patients with chronic lung disease, such as asthma The aim of our study was to investigate in asthmatic children the level of asthma control and the maintenance therapy used during the lockdown METHODS Among asthmatic children attending our clinic, we identified those who had been prescribed the same therapy in MarchApril 2019 and MarchApril 2020 The level of asthma control GINAscore and the maintenance therapy used during the lockdown MarchApril 2020 were compared with those of MarchApril 2019 We separately analyzed a small group of children with severe asthma treated with Omalizumab during the lockdown RESULTS We enrolled 92 asthmatic children 67 males Compared to 2019, in 2020 a higher proportion of children modified their maintenance therapy 38 vs 152, p,Ultrasound US is an ideal diagnostic tool for paediatric patients owning to its high spatial and temporal resolution, realtime imaging, and lack of ionizing radiation and bedside availability In the current World Federation of Societies for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology WFUMB paper series so far part I the topic has been introduced and the technical requirements explained In the present paper the use of US in the lung in paediatric patients is analysed Lung diseases including the interstitial syndrome, bacterial pneumonia and viral infections, CoViD findings, atelectasis, lung consolidation, bronchiolitis and congenital diseases of the respiratory system including congenital pulmonary airway malformation CPAM and sequester but also pneumothorax are discussed,Superior ophthalmic vein thrombosis is a very rare condition, known to have a profound negative impact on vision and eye movement function and is usually associated with orbital infections, inflammation, tumors, or carotid cavernous fistulae There is an increased risk of arterial and venous thrombosis associated with COVID19, the presence of which is related to a significantly increased risk of mortality We report an index case of superior ophthalmic vein thrombosis in a 61yearold male patient who was diagnosed with COVID19 pneumonitis and a concomitant saddle pulmonary embolus He was swiftly treated with low molecular weight heparin which led to the resolution of the thrombosis within 3 weeks This case highlights the importance of considering this entity in the context of COVID19 as well as providing prompt treatment to reduce the risk of complications,BackgroundIn February 2020 the corona virus disease 2019 COVID19 infection started spreading throughout Italy, hitting the Lombardy region very hard Despite the high diffusion, only a subset of patients developed severe COVID19 around 25 of them developed acute kidney injury AKI and onethird of them died Elderly patients and patients with high comorbidities were identified as being at higher risk of severe COVID19MethodsOur prospective observational cohort study includes 392 consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID19 in Milan median age 67xa0years, 75 male We evaluated the relationship between blood pressure at presentation, presence of AKI at Emergency Department admission and during hospitalization, and total inhospital mortality 24ResultsAlthough 58 of our study patients reported a history of hypertension HYP 86 on treatment, 30 presented with low blood pressure levels Only 55 were diagnosed with AKI on admission 75 of hypertensive patients discontinued therapy during hospitalization only 20 were on treatment at discharge Gender and hypertension were strongly associated with AKI at admission odds ratio 11 Blood pressure was inversely correlated with increased risk of AKI upon admission, regardless of the severity of respiratory distress Age over 65, history of hypertension, and severity of respiratory distress were the main predictors of AKI, which developed in 347 of cases during hospitalization AKI was associated with increased inhospital mortality Hypertension and low blood pressure at presentation were the main predictors of inhospital mortality, together with age over 65, baseline pulmonary involvement, and severity of illnessConclusionsIn patients hospitalized for COVID19, hypertension and low blood pressure at presentation are important risk factors for AKI and mortality Early reduction of antihypertensive therapy may improve outcomes in patients with SARSCoV2 infection,BACKGROUND Midregional proatrial natriuretic peptide MRproANP is a strong prognostic marker in several inflammatory, respiratory and cardiovascular conditions, but has not been studied in COVID19 yet METHODS This prospective, observational study of patients with COVID19 infection was conducted from 6 June to 26 November 2020 in different wards of a tertiary hospital MRproANP, Nterminal probrain natriuretic peptide NTproBNP and highsensitive cardiac troponin I levels on admission were collected and tested for their association with disease severity and 28day mortality RESULTS A total of 213 eligible patients with COVID19 were included in the final analyses of whom 132 nxa0xa028 died within 28xa0days Median levels of MRproANP at admission were significantly higher in nonsurvivors 307xa0pmolL IQR, 161  532 vs 75xa0pmolL IQR, 43  153, P,A total of 115 convalescent inpatients with COVID19 were enrolled According to the results of scans of lung lesions via computed tomography CT, the patients were divided into mild, moderate, and severe groups The clinical data of the patients were collected, including age, gender, finger pulse oxygen pressure, ventricular rate, body temperature, etc The correlation between the clinical indicators and the lesions of highresolution CT HRCT and bronchiectasis was analyzed Among the 115 patients, 82 had no bronchiectasis and 33 had bronchiectasis The bronchodilationprone layers mainly included the left and right lower lobe of the lung The probability of branching in the inflamed area was greater than that in the noninflamed area in patients with COVID19 There were significant differences in gender, CT lesion range, and number of incidents of bronchiectasis between noninflamed and inflamed areas P  005 Moreover, there were significant differences in age, total proportion of CT lesions, volume of CT lesions, and total number of patients with bronchiectasis among the three groups P  005 CT lesion range was positively correlated with the total number of patients with bronchiectasis and patient age respectively, r  0186, P  005 r  0029, P  005 The lesion range in HRCT images of lungs in patients with COVID19 is correlated with bronchodilation The larger the lesion, the higher the probability of bronchiectasis and the more incidents of bronchiectasis,Pointofcare lung ultrasound is a widely used tool in the diagnosis and management of patients with pulmonary diseases and now with SARSCoV2 infection We describe two cases of pneumothorax which are, as far as we know, among the first reported in COVID19 patients younger than 18u2009years The diagnostic and monitoring role of pointofcare lung ultrasound has been extremely useful in the management of patients,Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2 has been an increasingly prevalent target for investigation since its discovery 20 years ago The finding that it serves a counterregulatory function within the traditional reninangiotensin system, implicating it in cardiometabolic health, has increased its clinical relevance Focus on ACE2s role in cardiometabolic health has largely centered on its apparent functions in the context of obesity Interest in ACE2 has become even greater with the discovery that it serves as the cell receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2, opening up numerous mechanisms for deleterious effects of infection The proliferation of ACE2 within the literature coupled with its dual role in SARSCoV2 infection and obesity necessitates review of the current understanding of ACE2s physiological, pathophysiological, and potential therapeutic functions This review highlights the roles of ACE2 in cardiac dysfunction and obesity, with focus on epicardial adipose tissue, to reconcile the data in the context of SARSCoV2 infection,,BACKGROUND SARSCoV2 aerosolization during noninvasive positive pressure ventilation may endanger healthcare professionals Various circuit setups have been described in order to reduce virus aerosolization However, these setups may alter ventilator performances RESEARCH QUESTION What are the consequences of the different suggested circuit setups on ventilators efficacy during continuous positive airway pressure CPAP and noninvasive ventilation NIV STUDY DESIGN AND METHOD Eight circuit setups were evaluated on a bench made of a 3D printed head and an artificial lung Setups were a duallimb circuit with an oronasal mask, a duallimb circuit with a helmet interface, a singlelimb circuit with a passive exhalation valve, three singlelimb circuits with custommade additional leaks and two singlelimb circuits with active exhalation valves All setups were evaluated during NIV and CPAP The following variables were recorded the inspiratory flow preceding trigger of the ventilator, the inspiratory effort required to trigger the ventilator, the triggering delay, the maximal inspiratory pressure delivered by the ventilator, the tidal volume Vt generated to the artificial lung, the total work of breathing WOB and the pressure time product to trigger the ventilator PTPt RESULTS With NIV, the type of circuit setup had a significant impact on inspiratory flow preceding the trigger of the ventilator p00001, the inspiratory effort required to trigger the ventilator p00001, the triggering delay p00001 the maximal inspiratory pressure p00001, the Vt p00008, the WOB p00001, the PTPt p00001 Similar differences and consequences were seen with CPAP as well as with the addition of bacterial filters Best performance was achieved using a dual limb circuit with an oronasal mask Worst performance was achieved using a duallimb circuit with a helmet interface INTERPRETATION Ventilator performance is significantly impacted by the circuit setup The use of duallimb circuit with oronasal masks should be used preferentially,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2SARSCoV2, also known as COVID19 emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan, China and the World Health Organization declared the virus a pandemic on March 11, 2020 Disease progression from COVID19 infection has increasingly shown significant symptom manifestations within organ systems beyond the respiratory system In this regard, literature has shown increasing numbers of cardiovascular involvement during disease course and an associated increase in mortality among infected patients Complications involving the cardiovascular system include myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, shock, and heart failure In this evidencebased review, we discuss risk factors of cardiovascular involvement in COVID19 infection, pathophysiology of COVID19related cardiovascular infection and injury, COVID19 effects on the cardiovascular system and corresponding treatments, and hematologic effects of COVID19 and COVID19 in heart transplant patients Clinicians managing COVID19 patients should appreciate the potential cardiovascular effects related to the disease process,,,Hospitalizations for acute cardiac conditions have markedly declined during the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic, yet the cause of this decline is not clear Using remote monitoring data of 4,029 patients with implantable cardiac defibrillators ICDs living in New York City and MinneapolisSaint Paul, we assessed changes in markers of cardiac status among these patients and compared thoracic impedance and arrhythmia burden in 2019 and 2020 from January through August We found no change in several key disease decompensation markers among patients with implanted ICD devices during the first phase of COVID19 pandemic, suggesting that the decrease in cardiovascular hospitalizations in this period is not reflective of a true populationlevel improvement in cardiovascular health,,,BACKGROUND Several cases of invasive fungal diseases in patients with COVID19 have been reported, mostly due to Aspergillus spp, with anecdotic reports of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia PJP as coinfections in immunocompromised patients We describe the first case of PJP in an immunocompetent patient who recovered from COVID19 pneumonia CASE DESCRIPTION Our patient was hospitalized for 18xa0d for respiratory failure due to Severe Acute Respiratory SyndromeCoronavirus2 SARSCoV2 pneumonia and successfully treated with continuous positive airway pressure CPAP respiratory support, enoxaparin, ceftaroline and intravenous 6u2009mg of dexamethasone for 10xa0d, then with oral prednisone tapering Despite his improved radiological and clinical conditions at discharge, he was admitted again after 18xa0d for worsening of respiratory conditions Upon the second admission, a highresolution CTscan of the chest showed the development of new groundglass opacities and P jirovecii was detected on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid A therapy with trimethoprimsulphamethoxazole 20u2009mgkg and methylprednisolone 40u2009mg iv bis in die BID was started, with improvement of clinical, biochemical and radiological conditions CONCLUSIONS COVID19 patients may have multiple risk factors for development of PJP, in particular lymphopaenia and use of steroids PJP must be ruled out with direct microbiological methods in patients presenting with radiologic and clinical features of possible or probable PJP, even in immunocompetent hosts,Olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions OGD are a frequent symptom of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 It has been proposed that the neuroinvasive potential of the novel SARSCoV2 could be due to olfactory bulb invasion, conversely studies suggest it could be a good prognostic factor The aim of the current study was to investigate the prognosis value of OGD in COVID19 These symptoms were recorded on admission from a cohort study of 5868 patients with confirmed or highly suspected COVID19 infection included in the multicenter international HOPE Registry NCT04334291 There was statistical relation in multivariate analysis for OGD in gender, more frequent in female 1241 vs 867 in male, related to age, more frequent under 65xa0years, presence of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, smoke, renal insufficiency, lung, heart, cancer and neurological disease We did not find statistical differences in pregnant pu2009u20090505, patient suffering cognitive pu2009u20090484, liver pu2009u200901 or immune disease pu2009u2009032 There was inverse relation protective between OGD and prone positioning 0005 and death ,A new coronavirus respiratory disease COVID19 caused by the SARSCoV2 virus, surprised the entire world, producing social, economic, and health problems The COVID19 triggers a lung infection with a multiple proinflammatory cytokine storm in severe patients Without effective and safe treatments, COVID19 has killed thousands of people, becoming a pandemic Stem cells have been suggested as a therapy for lungrelated diseases In particular, mesenchymal stem cells MSCs have been successfully tested in some clinical trials in patients with COVID19 The encouraging results positioned MSCs as a possible cell therapy for COVID19 The amniotic membrane from the human placenta at term is a valuable stem cell source, including human amniotic epithelial cells hAECs and human mesenchymal stromal cells hAMSCs Interestingly, amnion cells have immunoregulatory, regenerative, and antiinflammatory properties Moreover, hAECs and hAMSCs have been used both in preclinical studies and in clinical trials against respiratory diseases They have reduced the inflammatory response and restored the pulmonary tissue architecture in lung injury in vivo models Here, we review the existing data about the stem cells use for COVID19 treatment, including the ongoing clinical trials We also consider the noncellular therapies that are being applied Finally, we discuss the human amniotic membrane cells use in patients who suffer from immuneinflammatory lung diseases and hypothesize their possible use as a successful treatment against COVID19,,BackgroundAs medical infrastructures are strained by SARSCoV2, rapid and accurate screening tools are essential In portions of the world, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction RTPCR testing remains slow and in limited supply, and computed tomography is expensive, inefficient, and involves exposure to ionizing radiation Multiple studies evaluating the efficiency of lung pointofcare ultrasound POCUS have been published recently, but include relatively small cohorts and often focus on characteristics associated with severe illness rather than screening efficacy This study utilizes a retrospective cohort to evaluate the test characteristics sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, predictive values of lung POCUS in the diagnosis of SARSCoV2, and to determine lung score cutoffs that maximize performance for use as a screening toolResultsLung POCUS examinations had sensitivity 86, specificity 716, NPV 817, and PPV 777 The Lung Ultrasound Score had an area under the curve of 084 95 CI 078, 090 When including only complete examinations visualizing 12 lung fields, lung POCUS had sensitivity 909 and specificity 756, with NPV 872 and PPV 820 and an area under the curve of 089 95 CI 083, 096 Lung POCUS was less accurate in patients with a history of interstitial lung disease, severe emphysema, and heart failureConclusionsWhen applied in the appropriate patient population, lung POCUS is an inexpensive and reliable tool for rapid screening and diagnosis of SARSCoV2 in symptomatic patients with influenzalike illness Adoption of lung POCUS screening for SARSCoV2 may identify patients who do not require additional testing and reduce the need for RTPCR testing in resourcelimited environments and during surge periods,,,BackgroundHydroxyurea is one of the earliest drugs that showed promise in the management of haemoglobinopathies that include βthalassaemia and sickle cell disease Despite this, many aspects of hydroxyurea are either unknown or understudied specifically, its usefulness in βthalassaemia major and haemoglobin E βthalassaemia is unclear However, during COVID19 pandemic, it has become a valuable adjunct to transfusion therapy in patients with βhaemoglobinopathies In this review, we aim to explore the available in vitro and in vivo mechanistic data and the clinical utility of hydroxyurea in βhaemoglobinopathies with a special emphasis on its usefulness during the COVID19 pandemicMain bodyHydroxyurea is an Sphasespecific drug that reversibly inhibits ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase enzyme which catalyses an essential step in the DNA biosynthesis In human erythroid cells, it induces the expression of γglobin, a fetal globin gene that is suppressed after birth Through several molecular pathways described in this review, hydroxyurea exerts many favourable effects on the haemoglobin content, red blood cell indices, ineffective erythropoiesis, and blood rheology in patients with βhaemoglobinopathies Currently, it is recommended for sickle cell disease and nontransfusion dependent βthalassaemia A number of clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate its usefulness in transfusion dependent βthalassaemia During the COVID19 pandemic, it was widely used as an adjunct to transfusion therapy due to limitations in the availability of blood and logistical disturbances Thus, it has become clear that hydroxyurea could play a remarkable role in reducing transfusion requirements of patients with haemoglobinopathies, especially when donor blood is a limited resourceConclusionHydroxyurea is a welltolerated oral drug which has been in use for many decades Through its actions of reversible inhibition of ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase enzyme and fetal haemoglobin induction, it exerts many favourable effects on patients with βhaemoglobinopathies It is currently approved for the treatment of sickle cell disease and nontransfusion dependent βthalassaemia Also, there are various observations to suggest that hydroxyurea is an important adjunct in the treatment of transfusion dependent βthalassaemia which should be confirmed by randomised clinical trials,Several independent datasets suggest blood type A is overrepresented and type O underrepresented among COVID19 patients However, blood group antigens appear not to be conventional susceptibility factors in that they do not affect disease severity, and the relative risk to nonO individuals is attenuated when population prevalence is high Here, I model a scenario in which ABO transfusion incompatibility reduces the chance of a patient transmitting the virus to an incompatible recipient  thus in Western populations type A and AB individuals are superrecipients while type O individuals are superspreaders This results in an offset in the timing of the epidemic among individuals of different blood types, and an increased relative risk to type AAB patients that is most pronounced during early stages of the epidemic However, once the majority of any given population is infected, the relative risk to each blood type approaches unity Published data on COVID19 prevalence from regions in the early stages of the SARSCoV2 epidemic suggests that if this model holds true, ABO incompatibility reduces virus transmissibility by at least 60  Exploring the implications of this model for vaccination strategies shows that paradoxically, targeted vaccination of either highsusceptibility type AAB or superspreader type O individuals is less effective than random vaccination at blocking community spread of the virus Instead, the key is to maintain blood type diversity among the remaining susceptible individuals Given the good agreement between this model and observational data on disease prevalence, the underlying biochemistry urgently requires experimental investigation,INTRODUCTION The longstanding dogma that the healthy lung is sterile has been refuted by recent advances in cultureindependent analyses of airway samples The respiratory microbiome comprises all airway and lung tissueassociated microbes These microorganisms occur throughout the upper and lower respiratory tracts, with different populations and distinct burdens at specific sites and can be classified as pathogenic or commensal AREAS COVERED The majority of studies investigating the respiratory microbiome have focused on bacteria however, emerging evidence has revealed the composition of the lung virome, the global viral communities present in the lung tissue In this review, we searched PubMed and used keywords such as airway microbiome We restricted outputs to English language and did not limit by any dates We summarize the uptodate knowledge on how the microbiome interacts with the host immune system and influences the pathogenesis of pulmonary viral infections EXPERT OPINION The relationship between colonizing microbes and the host is complex and various factors need to be considered in order to appreciate its pathophysiological consequences Understanding these intricate mechanisms of interaction among the respiratory microbiome, viruses and the immune response may lead to the development of better therapies to treat or prevent respiratory viral infections,Abstract  Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is associated with a high risk of mortality especially in patients with cardiovascular conditions such as heart failure The UK government announced a national lockdown last year to curb the spread of the virus We conducted this study primarily to ascertain the impact of lockdown upon the incidence of COVID19 hospitalisation amongst patients with a known diagnosis of heart failure HF   Methods  This was a retrospective cohort study of 1097 patients from our HF registry who had presented with acute decompensated HF in 2018 and 2019 Incidence and outcomes of hospitalisation due to COVID19 were analysed in this cohort both during the 1 st UK lockdown as well as after the lockdown period Comorbidities, frailty index, clinical features, blood results, and heart failure treatments were compared between the 2 groups COVID versus noCOVID and between the group of patients who died versus survivors    Results 50 out of 801 surviving 62 HF patients required hospitalisation due to COVID19 from March to November 2020 24 patients 31 during the first lockdown and 26 35 in the postlockdown period p07 In comparison to patients not hospitalised with COVID19 noCOVID group, there was a significantly higher prevalence of comorbidities amongst HF patients who were hospitalised with COVID19, such as hypertension p0001, diabetes p0005, ischaemic heart disease p001 and increased body mass index 30 day mortality amongst HF patients hospitalised due to COVID19 was 52 Rockwood Frailty Score 6 OR 6530695  CI18958 to 224961 p0003 and diabetes OR 38295 CI 113 to 1295 p003 were independent predictors of 30 day mortality   Conclusion Our data suggests that the incidence of hospitalisation due to COVID19 was similar both during as well as post lockdown amongst patients from our HF registry HF patients with cardiovascular comorbidities such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes and ischaemic heart disease have a higher risk of hospitalisation due to COVID19 Diabetes and Rockwood Frailty score are independent predictors of short term mortality Comorbidity and frailty scores should be incorporated during initial assessment to help riskprediction,Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 can cause a wide range of cardiovascular diseases, including STsegment elevation myocardial infarction STEMI and STEMImimickers such as myocarditis, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, among others We performed a systematic review to summarize the clinical features, management, and outcomes of patients with COVID19 who had STsegment elevation We searched electronic databases from inception to September 30, 2020 for studies that reported clinical data about COVID19 patients with STsegment elevation Differences between patients with and without obstructive coronary artery disease CAD on coronary angiography were evaluated Fortytwo studies 35 case reports and seven case series involving 161 patients were included The mean age was 627u2009u2009136xa0years and 75 were men The most frequent symptom was chest pain 78 Eightythree percent of patients had obstructive CAD Patients with nonobstructive CAD had more diffuse STsegment elevation 13 versus 1, pu2009u2009003 and diffuse left ventricular wallmotion abnormality 23 versus 3, pu2009u2009002 compared to obstructive CAD In patients with previous coronary stent nu2009u200917, the 76 presented with stent thrombosis In the majority of cases, the main reperfusion strategy was primary percutaneous coronary intervention instead of fibrinolysis The inhospital mortality was 30 without difference between patients with 30 or without 31 obstructive CAD Our data suggest that a relatively high proportion of COVID19 patients with STsegment elevation had nonobstructive CAD The prognosis was poor across groups However, our findings are based on case reports and case series that should be confirmed in future studies,,,Wearable sensors to continuously measure blood pressure and derived cardiovascular variables have the potential to revolutionize patient monitoring Current wearable methods analyzing time components eg, pulse transit time still lack clinical accuracy, whereas existing technologies for direct blood pressure measurement are too bulky Here we present an innovative art of continuous noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring CNAP2GO It directly measures blood pressure by using a volume control technique and could be used for small wearable sensors integrated in a fingerring As a software prototype, CNAP2GO showed excellent blood pressurexa0measurement performance in comparison with invasive reference measurementsxa0in 46 patients having surgery The resulting pulsatile blood pressure signal carries information to derive cardiac output and other hemodynamic variables We show that CNAP2GO can selfcalibrate and be miniaturized for wearable approaches CNAP2GO potentially constitutes the breakthrough for wearable sensors for blood pressure and flow monitoring in both ambulatory and inhospital clinical settings,BACKGROUND Heart failure HF is a complex and serious condition associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs We conducted a systematic review and metaanalysis to evaluate the effects of mobile health technology mHealth interventions compared with usual care in patients with HF MATERIALS AND METHODS We searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and EMBASE databases to identify eligible randomized controlled trials RCTs of mHealth interventions Primary outcomes included allcause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, HFrelated hospitalizations, and allcause hospitalizations Metaanalyses using a randomeffects model were performed for all outcomes Risk of bias and quality of evidence were evaluated using the Cochrane Tool and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation GRADE framework RESULTS Sixteen RCTs involving 4,389 patients were included Compared with usual care, mHealth interventions reduced the risk of allcause mortality risk ratio RR 080 95 CI 065097 absolute risk reduction ARR 21 highquality evidence, cardiovascular mortality RR 070 95 CI 053091, ARR 29 highquality evidence, and HF hospitalizations RR 077 95 CI 067088 ARR 5 highquality evidence, but had no effect on allcause hospitalizations Results were driven by mHealth interventions with remote monitoring and clinical feedback, which were associated with larger reductions than standalone mHealth interventions However, subgroup differences were not statistically significant CONCLUSIONS mHealth interventions with remote monitoring and clinical feedback reduce mortality and HFrelated hospitalizations, but may not reduce allcause hospitalizations in patients with HF Additional studies are needed to determine the efficacy of standalone mHealth interventions as well as active features of mHealth which contribute to efficacy,Radiological and functional sequelae of Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID19 pneumonia are still poorly understood This was a prospective, observational, physiological, cohort study on consecutive adult patients with COVID19 pneumonia admitted in AprilMay 2020 in the high dependency respiratory unit of L Sacco University Hospital in Milan Italy During hospitalization, patients underwent chest computed tomography CT, blood gas analysis, spirometry, and lung diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide DLco, which were repeated 6 weeks postdischarge Chest CTs were individually read by two expert radiologists, that calculated the total severity score TSS Twenty patients completed the study mean age 582 years, 70 males During the acute phase, mean DLco, alveolar volume VA, and vital capacity VC were 560 163, 648 140, and 717 169  predicted, respectively, and were inversely associated with PaO2FiO2 ratio Fifty percent of patients had a restrictive ventilatory pattern mean TSS was 79 40 At follow up, gas exchange parameters were normalized consolidations persisted in 10 of cases, while DLco was 80 predicted in 65 of patients and was independently predicted by Log10Ddimer at admission β 18675 95CI, 283739076 p  0001 In conclusion, functional abnormalities in COVID19 pneumonia survivors can persist during follow up and are associated with the severity of the disease,Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is an acute respiratory illness caused by novel coronavirus SARSCoV2 The clinical manifestations of this infection have a range and typically include impairment of smell, taste disturbance, cough, fever, and shortness of breath Gastrointestinal manifestations have been reported in anywhere from 3 to 50 of patients with concomitant SARSCoV2 pulmonary infection Abnormalities in coagulation markers have been reported in patients hospitalized with COVID19 During this article, we will introduce a patient with COVID 19 but with the most manifestation of abdominal pain due to intestinal ischemia and mesenteric vascular thrombosis,,The mechanisms of acute respiratory failure other than inflammation and complicating the SARSCoV2 infection are still far from being fully understood, thus challenging the management of COVID19 patients in the critical care setting In this unforeseen scenario, the role of an individuals excessive spontaneous breathing may acquire critical importance, being one potential and important driver of lung injury and disease progression The consequences of this acute lung damage may impair lung structure, forecasting the model of a fragile respiratory system This perspective article aims to analyze the progression of injured lung phenotypes across the SARSCoV2 induced respiratory failure, pointing out the role of spontaneous breathing and also tackling the specific respiratoryventilatory strategy required by the fragile lung type,,The lactate threshold LT1, which is defined as the first rise in lactate concentration during incremental exercise, has not been noninvasively and conveniently determined in a clinical setting We aimed to visualize changes in lactate concentration in sweat during exercisexa0using our wearable lactate sensor and investigate the relationship between the lactate threshold LT1 and ventilatory threshold VT1 Twentythree healthy subjects and 42 patients with cardiovascular diseases CVDs were enrolledxa0During exercise, the dynamic changes in lactate values in sweat were visualized in realtime with a sharp continuous increasexa0up toxa0volitional exhaustion and a gradual decrease during the recovery period The LT1 in sweat was well correlated with the LT1 in blood and the VT1 ru2009u2009092 and 071, respectively In addition, the BlandAltman plot described no bias between the mean values mean differences xa045 and 25xa0W, respectively Continuous monitoring of lactate concentrations during exercise can provide additional information for detecting the VT1,Background The relationship between coronavirus disease 2019 Covid19 and ischemic stroke is poorly defined We aimed to leverage genetic data to investigate reported associations Methods Genetic association estimates for liability to Covid19 and cardiovascular traits were obtained from largescale consortia Analyses primarily focused on critical Covid19, defined as hospitalization with Covid19 requiring respiratory support or resulting in death Crosstrait linkage disequilibrium score regression was used to estimate genetic correlations of critical Covid19 with ischemic stroke, other related cardiovascular outcomes, and risk factors common to both Covid19 and cardiovascular disease body mass index, smoking and chronic inflammation, estimated using Creactive protein Mendelian randomization analysis was performed to investigate whether liability to critical Covid19 was associated with increased risk of any of the cardiovascular outcomes for which genetic correlation was identified Results There was evidence of genetic correlation between critical Covid19 and ischemic stroke r g 029, FDR p value465×10 3 , body mass index r g 021, FDR p value  626×10 6  and Creactive protein r g 020, FDR p value135×10 4 , but none of the other considered traits In Mendelian randomization analysis, liability to critical Covid19 was associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke odds ratio OR per logOR increase in genetically predicted critical Covid19 liability 103, 95 confidence interval 100106, p value003 Similar estimates were obtained when considering ischemic stroke subtypes Consistent estimates were also obtained when performing statistical sensitivity analyses more robust to the inclusion of pleiotropic variants, including multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses adjusting for potential genetic confounding through body mass index, smoking and chronic inflammation There was no evidence to suggest that genetic liability to ischemic stroke increased the risk of critical Covid19 Conclusions These data support that liability to critical Covid19 is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke The host response predisposing to severe Covid19 is likely to increase the risk of ischemic stroke, independent of other potentially mitigating risk factors,,Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome is a rare disease which is diagnosed after excluding other conditions The syndrome is characterized by multiple organ involvement including the heart, nervous system, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract The disease is suspected if there is peripheral blood eosinophilia and no clear etiology The main treatment is corticosteroids Patients who do not respond to corticosteroids can be treated with imatinib, immunomodulatory agents, myelosuppressive therapy, or mepolizumab Alemtuzumab can be considered in severe cases that are unresponsive to other therapies In this paper, we describe a case of idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome with mainly cardiac system involvement and left ventricular thrombus formation which was complicated by cerebral thromboemboli while on warfarin with international normalized ratio in the therapeutic range Our patient responded well to steroids appreciated by improvement in clinical symptoms and decrease in eosinophil count,The development of cardiac computed tomography CT in the year 2020 was characterized by 3xa0dominant trends in coronary imaging, namely 1xa0the prognostic importance of coronary plaque formation, 2xa0the possibilities associated with its volumetric quantification and 3xa0the increase in importance attributed to coronary CT angiography CTA in the current guidelines, enhanced by its increasing use in the treatment of structural heart disease The publication of the results of the International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches ISCHEMIA has underlined the importance of anatomic characterization of coronary heart disease by visualizing coronary plaques Aided by machine learningartificial intelligence, algorithms have been established for reproducible automated quantitative coronary plaque volumetry These advances have led to questioning the significance of measuring myocardial ischemia, as it results secondarily from coronary plaque formation Furthermore, the understanding of the pathophysiology of coronary heart disease has changed the volume of noncalcified coronary plaque formation, its localization and dynamics as characteristics of vulnerability, appear to be more important than the focus on axa0large atheroma or expansive outward remodeling of individual plaques In the guidelines coronary CTA has been promoted to the firstline diagnostic measure in both chronic and acute coronary syndromes without STelevation, with an equal strength of recommendation compared with classical imaging ischemia tests Apart from this, cardiac CT is increasingly used for treatment planning of diseases, particularly of aortic and tricuspid valves, but also other structural heart diseases eg occlusion of the left atrial appendage LAA,Percutaneous closure of post infarction ventricular septal defect PIVSD after myocardial infarction is one of the most demanding interventional procedures Patients are usually haemodynamically b,RNA N6methyladenosine m6A regulators play important roles in a variety of biological functions Nonetheless, the roles of m6A regulators in childhood asthma remain unknown In this study, 11 significant m6A regulators were selected using difference analysis between nonasthmatic and asthmatic patients from the Gene Expression Omnibus GSE40888 dataset The random forest model was used to screen five candidate m6A regulators fragile X mental retardation 1, KIAA1429, Wilms tumor 1associated protein, YTH domaincontaining 2, and zinc finger CCCH domaincontaining protein 13 to predict the risk of childhood asthma A nomogram model was established based on the five candidate m6A regulators Decision curve analysis indicated that patients could benefit from the nomogram model The consensus clustering method was performed to differentiate children with asthma into two m6A patterns clusterA and clusterB based on the selected significant m6A regulators Principal component analysis algorithms were constructed to calculate the m6A score for each sample to quantify the m6A patterns The patients in clusterB had higher m6A scores than those in clusterA Furthermore, we found that the patients in clusterA were linked to helper T cell type 1 Th1dominant immunity while those in clusterB were linked to Th2dominant immunity In summary, m6A regulators play nonnegligible roles in the occurrence of childhood asthma Our investigation of m6A patterns may be able to guide future immunotherapy strategies for childhood asthma,BackgroundOrthostatic hypotension OH in geriatric patients frequently involves a component of autonomic failure AF The combination of OH with nocturnal hypertension NHT is indicative of AF, which is described as pure PAF, when neurologic symptoms are absent, or as multisystem atrophy MSA, when combined with motor disturbance Parkinsonism or Parkinson diseaseCase presentation An 87yearold man presented with longlasting OH He frequently fell, causing several fractures, and he developed heart failure Blood pressure BP registration revealed a reversal of the daynight rhythm with NHT An 18FDG PET brain CT scan showed cerebellar hypometabolism, indicating MSAConclusionsThis case demonstrates the use of continuous BP registration in geriatric patients with OH for diagnosing NHT It illustrates the usefulness of 18FDG PET brain CT scan to specify the nature of the AF The case also illustrates the difficulty of managing the combination of OH and NHT,PurposeWe sought to assess the prognostic role of the extent of cardiac damage among realworld patients with severe aortic stenosis AS undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation TAVIMethodsA staging classification was applied to 262 patients from the EffecTAVI Registry at baseline and reassessed within 30day after TAVI Allcause mortality at 1year was the primary endpoint of the study Cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, permanent pacemaker implantation, endocarditis and rehospitalization for all caused were included as secondary endpoints ResultsAt baseline, 23 87 patients were in Stage 01 no cardiac damageleft ventricular damage, 106 404 in Stage 2 left atrial or mitral valve damage, 59 225 in Stage 3 pulmonary vasculature or tricuspid valve damage and 74 283 in Stage 4 right ventricular damage At 30day after TAVI, a lower prevalence of advanced stages of cardiac damage than baseline, mainly driven by a significant improvement in left ventricular diastolic parameters and right ventricular function, was reported At 1year, a stepwise increase in mortality rates was observed according to staging at baselinexa043 in Stage 01, 66 in Stage 2, 186 in Stage 3 and 216 in Stage 4 p 008 No differences were found in secondary endpoints ConclusionsAlthough TAVI might be associated with an amelioration of the left ventricular diastolic and right ventricular function, patients with a greater extent of cardiac damage at baseline are at higher risk of mortality at 1year after the procedure,OBJECTIVES AND METHODS the current understanding of the interplay between cardiovascular CV risk and Covid19 is grossly inadequate CV riskprediction models are used to identify and treat high risk populations and to communicate risk effectively These tools are unexplored in Covid19 The main objective is to evaluate the association between CV scoring systems and chest X ray CXR examination in terms of severity of lung involvement in 50 Italian Covid19 patients Results only the Framingham Risk Score FRS was applicable to all patients The Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Score ASCVD was applicable to half 62 of patients were classified as high risk according to FRS and 41 according to ASCVD Patients who died had all a higher FRS compared to survivors They were all hypertensive FRS30 patients had a 97 higher probability of dying compared to patients with a lower FRS We found a strong correlation between CXR severity and FRS and ASCVD P  0001 High CV risk patients had consolidations more frequently CXR severity was significantly associated with hypertension and diabetes 71 of hypertensive patients CXR and 88 of diabetic patients CXR had consolidations Patients with diabetes or hypertension had 8 times greater risk of having consolidations CONCLUSIONS High CV risk correlates with more severe CXR pattern and death Diabetes and hypertension are associated with more severe CXR FRS offers more predictive utility and fits best to our cohort These findings may have implications for clinical practice and for the identification of highrisk groups to be targeted for the vaccine precedence,The pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2, or coronavirus disease 2019, COVID19 has been raging all over the globe for more than one year COVID19 virus can attack multiple organs through binding to angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2 receptors and further induce systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation In the last issue of 2020 AJNMMI httpwwwajnmmius, Lima et al summarized current biological complications of COVID19, their underlying mechanisms, and our options of mapping these functional sequelae using nuclear imaging techniques Four major organs, including the lung, heart, kidney, and endothelium, were identified as most vulnerable to COVID19 viruses in severe patients Nuclear medicine proved accurate and sensitive in assessing the onset, progression, and treatment of COVID19 patients By choosing the most appropriate radiotracers and imaging methods, clinicians and researchers are able to analyze and monitor the presence of inflammation, fibrosis, and changes of metabolic rates in organs of interest With these desirable nuclear imaging methods, systematic evaluation of COVID19, from its onset to functional sequela, can be achieved with rational patient stratification and timely treatment monitoring, which we believe will eventually lead to full victory against the pandemic,BackgroundSicklecell anaemia is a widespread genetic disease prevalent worldwide among African and AfricanAmerican populations The pathogenesis is most often revealed by pulmonary conditions, including acute thoracic syndrome, which is affecting the life expectancy of these populations The global spread of CoV2SARS infection with a respiratory tropism, endothelial damages and procoagulant status endangers the SCD population However, with only a few case reports, consequences of the Covid19 pandemic on SCD population remain poorly knownCase presentationWe report a case of a 33yearold man with a history of homozygous SS homozygous sickle cell anemiaxa0who consulted on March 24, 2020 for febrile dyspnea 11xa0days after the onset of symptoms A nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARSCoV2 His respiratory status worsened rapidly in the emergency room and then in ICU leading to severe ARDS requiring intubation, curarization, and venovenous ECMO Hematologically, severe hemolysis associated with major thrombocytopenia without documented spinal cord injury was noted Several transfusion exchanges are performed The evolution was finally slowly favorable and led to discharge from the intensive care unit and then from the hospitalConclusionsThis casexa0recalls the importance of an increased prevention policy against COVID19among the SCD population In addition, from a therapeutic point of view, it advocates 1 a high preventive anticoagulation from the outset according to the level of Ddimers 2 the use of venovenous ECMO in this particular case, whereas this technique has had rather disappointing results in acute chest syndromes 3 Unexpectedly, our patient did not develop pulmonary arterial hypertension PAH and acute cor pulmonale ACP, whereas this is a common feature of ARDS during SCD These last two observations suggest a different pathophysiology of pulmonary disorders in SCD patients in the case of SARS COv2 It could be associated with marked hypoxemia secondary to pulmonary vascular vasodilation,Myocarditis is the inflammation of the myocardium and is a challenging diagnosis owing to the heterogeneity in its etiology, pathogenesis and clinical presentations It often presents as an acute coronary syndrome ACS mimic and hence may pose both diagnostic and therapeutic challenges to treating physicians to reliably differentiate between these two entities In this case, we discuss a young male whose initial presentation of chest pain was dubious of the acute coronary syndrome but detailed history, physical examination and by careful selection of noninvasive investigations including echo and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging MRI, led to a diagnosis of acute myocarditis This approach not only avoided undue radiation exposure to a young individual but also eluded the unnecessary treatment with potent antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy,,,The two axes of the reninangiotensin system include the classical ACEAng IIAT1 axis and the counterregulatory ACE2Ang17Mas1 axis ACE2 is a multifunctional monocarboxypeptidase responsible for generating Ang17 from Ang II ACE2 is important in the vascular system where it is found in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in many vascular beds Among the best characterized functions of ACE2 is its role in regulating vascular tone ACE2 through its effector peptide Ang17 and receptor Mas1 induces vasodilation and attenuates Ang IIinduced vasoconstriction In endothelial cells activation of the ACE2Ang17Mas1 axis increases production of the vasodilators nitric oxide and prostacyclins and in vascular smooth muscle cells it inhibits procontractile and proinflammatory signaling Endothelial ACE2 is cleaved by proteases, shed into the circulation and measured as soluble ACE2 Plasma ACE2 activity is increased in cardiovascular disease and may have prognostic significance in disease severity In addition to its enzymatic function, ACE2 is the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome SARScoronavirus CoV and SARSCov2, which cause SARS and coronavirus disease19 COVID19 respectively ACE2 is thus a doubleedged sword it promotes cardiovascular health while also facilitating the devastations caused by coronaviruses COVID19 is associated with cardiovascular disease as a risk factor and as a complication Mechanisms linking COVID19 and cardiovascular disease are unclear, but vascular ACE2 may be important This review focuses on the vascular biology and pathophysiology of ACE2 in cardiovascular health and disease and briefly discusses the role of vascular ACE2 as a potential mediator of vascular injury in COVID19,INTRODUCTION Simultaneous occurrence of acute ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction is reported to have variable precipitating causes This occurrence has been rarely reported in the literature and described only in very few case reports During the surge of coronavirus disease COVID19 in our region, we noted an increase in the simultaneous occurrence of cardiocerebral infarction This led us to explore the possible mechanisms and pathophysiology that could contribute to this increase The retrospective nature of the study limited us from drawing any conclusion about causation Rather, we aimed to formulate a hypothesis for future, more rigorous studies PATIENT CONCERNS We present an overview of 5 cases of simultaneous cardiocerebral infarction that we encountered in our emergency department within 1 month DIAGNOSIS In all cases, diagnosis was confirmed using an electrocardiogram, assessment of laboratory cardiac markers, and imaging INTERVENTIONS In all cases, dual antiplatelet therapy was started and thrombolysis was held, as the condition was considered high risk in most of the patients Cardiac catheterization lab was not activated either because the patient was unstable or the risk of COVID19 in staff outweighed the benefit added in patient treatment OUTCOMES Two out of 5 patients died because of early complications that lasted for few days The remaining 3 were discharged from the hospital in moderate functionality for extensive therapy and rehabilitation CONCLUSION Early recognition and immediate treatment is important in different scenarios leading to thrombosis as the outcome Additionally, addressing the unknown risks that could contribute to our traditional understanding of these causative mechanisms is important The hypothesis of exacerbated damage caused by inflammatory and immunological endothelial systemic damage should further be explored to be able to delineate new possibilities in managing these conditions,BackgroundTo evaluate the clinical value of the chest CT scan compared to the reference standard realtime polymerase chain reaction RTPCR in COVID19 patientsMethodsFrom March 29th to April 15th of 2020, a total of 240 patients with respiratory distress underwent both a lowdose chest CT scan and RTPCR tests The performance of chest CT in diagnosing COVID19 was assessed with reference to the RTPCR result Two boardcertified radiologists mean 24xa0years of experience chest CT, blinded for the RTPCR result, reviewed all scans and decided positive or negative chest CT findings by consensus ResultsOut of 240 patients, 60 144240 had positive RTPCR results and 89 213240 had a positive chest CT scans The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value PPV and negative predictive value NPV of chest CT in suggesting COVID19 were 100 95 CI 97100, 144240, 28 95 CI 1938, 27240, 68 95 CI 6570 and 100, respectively The diagnostic accuracy of the chest CT suggesting COVID19 was 71 95 CI 6577 Thirtythree patients with positive chest CT scan and negative RTPCR test at baseline underwent repeat RTPCR assay In this subgroup, 212 733 cases became RTPCR positiveConclusionChest CT imaging has high sensitivity and high NPV for diagnosing COVID19 and can be considered as an alternative primary screening tool for COVID19 in epidemic areas In addition, a negative RTPCR test, but positive CT findings can still be suggestive of COVID19 infection,Background Cardiovascular department restriction policies on procedures resulting from the COVID19 pandemic have not been fully evaluated Methodsu2004andu2004Results We performed a retrospective analysis of a nationwide survey performed by the Japanese Circulation Society in August 2020 The total response rate was 489 6511,331 The rate of restriction of cardiovascular procedures peaked in April Exacerbations of heart failure due to hospital restrictions were noted in 438 of departments Conclusions Many departments restricted their cardiological procedures, and this rate changed according to the pandemic situation The exacerbation of cardiovascular disease resulting from pandemic restrictions should not be ignored,PURPOSE OF REVIEW Summarize recent recommendations on clinical management of adults and youth with elevated lipoproteina Lpa who are atrisk of or affected by cardiovascular disease CVD RECENT FINDINGS There is ample evidence to support elevated Lpa levels, present in approximately 20 of the general population, as a causal, independent risk factor for CVD and its role as a significant risk enhancer Several guidelines and position statements have been published to assist in the identification, treatment and followup of adults with elevated levels of Lpa There is growing interest in Lpa screening and strategies to improve health behaviors starting in youth, although published recommendations for this population are limited In addition to the well established increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and valvular aortic stenosis, data from the coronavirus pandemic suggest adults with elevated Lpa may have a particularly highrisk of cardiovascular complications Lpaspecificlowering therapies are currently in development Despite their inability to lower Lpa, use of statins have been shown to improve outcomes in primary and secondary prevention SUMMARY Considerable differences exist amongst published guidelines for adults on the use of Lpa in clinical practice, and recommendations for youth are limited With increasing knowledge of Lpas role in CVD, including recent observations of COVID19related risk of cardiovascular complications, more harmonized and comprehensive guidelines for Lpa in clinical practice are required This will facilitate clinical decisionmaking and help define best practices for identification and management of elevated Lpa in adults and youth,INTRODUCTION Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 may predispose patients to increased risk of venous thromboembolism VTE due to various pathophysiological mechanisms, including but not limited to endothelial injury, inflammation, cytokinemediated microvascular damage, and reactive thrombocytosis A high risk of vessel thrombosis correlates with disease severity, making early identification and treatment of prime considerationAlthough identification of a deep venous thrombosis DVT or pulmonary embolism warrants immediate treatment with anticoagulation, trying to predict which COVID19 patients may be at increased risk for developing these pathologies is challenging CASE REPORTS We present two cases of patients with COVID19 who had ultrasonographic findings of turbulent blood flow within the deep venous system, without clear evidence of acute proximal DVT, who were subsequently found to have significant VTE CONCLUSION Pointofcare lower extremity ultrasound has become one of the core applications used by emergency physicians Typically we perform compression ultrasound for DVT evaluation This novel finding of turbulent blood flow, or smoke, within the deep venous system, may serve as a marker of increased risk of clot development and could be an indication to consider early anticoagulation,BackgroundPulmonary involvement in COVID19 is characterized pathologically by diffuse alveolar damage DAD and thrombosis, leading to the clinical picture of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome The direct action of SARSCoV2 in lung cells and the dysregulated immunocoagulative pathways activated in ARDS influence pulmonary involvement in severe COVID, that might be modulated by disease duration and individual factors In this study we assessed the proportions of different lung pathology patterns in severe COVID19 patients along the disease evolution and individual characteristicsMethodsWe analysed lung tissue from 41 COVID19 patients that died in the period MarchJune 2020 and were submitted to a minimally invasive autopsy Eight pulmonary regions were sampled Pulmonary pathologists analysed the HE stained slides, performing semiquantitative scores on the following parameters exudative, intermediate or advanced DAD, bronchopneumonia, alveolar haemorrhage, infarct , arteriolar number or capillary thrombosis yesno Histopathological data were correlated with demographicclinical variables and periods of symptomshospital stayResultsPatient´s age varied from 22 to 88xa0years 18f23xa0m, with hospital admission varying from 0 to 40xa0days All patients had different proportions of DAD in their biopsies Ninety percent of the patients presented pulmonary microthrombosis The proportion of exudative DAD was higher in the period 08xa0days of hospital admission till death, whereas advanced DAD was higher after 17xa0days of hospital admission In the group of patients that died within eight days of hospital admission, elderly patients had less proportion of the exudative pattern and increased proportions of the intermediate patterns Obese patients had lower proportion of advanced DAD pattern in their biopsies, and lower than patients with overweight Clustering analysis showed that patterns of vascular lesions microthrombosis, infarction clustered together, but not the other patterns The vascular pattern was not influenced by demographic or clinical parameters, including time of disease progressionConclusionPatients with severe COVID19 present different proportions of DAD patterns over time, with advanced DAD being more prevalent after 17xa0days, which seems to be influenced by age and weight Vascular involvement is present in a large proportion of patients, occurs early in disease progression, and does not change over time,Background This study aims to describe one centers experience in expanding a fetal telecardiology program through collaborative work with maternal fetal medicine MFM clinics with the goal of safely reaching mothers during the COVID19 pandemic We sought to define the extent of fetal telehealth conversion at a large fetal cardiac care center and evaluate the diagnostic accuracy for studies performed Methods At our center, fetal telemedicine expanded from one MFM site before the pandemic to four additional sites by May 2020 A retrospective review of fetal telecardiology visits between March 15 and July 15, 2020, was performed The chart was reviewed for confirmation of diagnosis postnatally Results With pandemic onset, there was a large increase in the number of telemedicine visits with a total of 122 mothers seen between five MFM clinics Fourteen mothers 115 had abnormal fetal echocardiograms requiring additional followup, and seven mothers 58 had a fetal echocardiogram suspicious for a critical congenital heart disease CCHD All the fetal echocardiograms suspicious for CCHD were confirmed on postnatal echocardiogram To our knowledge, none of the normal fetal echocardiograms were found to have congenital heart disease postnatally Conclusions In response to the COVID19 pandemic, we rapidly transitioned to fetal telecardiology using a variety of formats This has reduced potential infectious exposure for pregnant mothers and minimized contact between physicians without compromising diagnostic accuracy In our experience, the expansion of a telemedicine program requires strong initial infrastructure, prior relationships with MFM providers, and appropriate training among obstetric sonographers,Abstract We appreciate the comments of Cavalli and Dagna regarding our case series addressing the potential utility of anakinra to avoid the need for mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID‐19, severe hypoxic respiratory failure and evidence of cytokine storm syndrome CSS 1 We thank them for pointing out the similarity of the patients in their recently reported study of COVID‐19 patients who received high‐dose intravenous anakinra Indeed, 25 of the 29 patients treated with anakinra in their similar study had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome 2 Cavalli et al defined severe respiratory distress as partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood to the fractional concentration of oxygen in inspired air  100 mmHg in the setting of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and a positive end‐expiratory pressure  5 cm H2O,,Twave inversion in ECG is very frequent and concerning finding as it is often associated with lifethreatening conditions There are numerous conditions mentioned in the literature for transient Twave inversion such as acute coronary syndrome, cardiac memory Twave, subarachnoid hemorrhage, electroconvulsive therapy, hyperventilation and indeterminate origin Hyperventilation is already known as a cause of transient Twave inversion however, it is often forgotten in modern clinical settingsxa0A 33yearold doctor working in the same hospital reported to the emergency department during working hours with a history of acute onset breathing difficulties and atypical chest pain involving the retrosternal regionxa0Arterial blood gas analysis ABG findings of respiratory alkalosis with transient Twave inversion, which normalized soon after normal breathing and reassurance along with normal cardiac workup helped us to reach the correct diagnosis of hyperventilation syndrome,Disseminated intravascular coagulation DIC is a pathological coagulopathy associated with infection that increases mortality In DIC, excessive thrombin generation causes symptoms from formation of microthrombi to multiorgan failure bleeding risks can also be a concern because of clotting factor consumption Different clinical events lead to DIC, including sepsis, trauma, and shock Treatments for thrombotic episodes or bleeding presentation in DIC oppose each other, thus creating therapeutic dilemmas in management The objective of this study was to develop fibrinspecific coreshell nanogels FSNs loaded with tissuetype plasminogen activator tPA to treat the microcirculatory complications of DIC, which would facilitate targeted clot dissolution to manage microthrombi and the potential consumptive coagulopathy that causes bleeding FSNs enhance formation of actively polymerizing clots by crosslinking fibrin fibers, but they can also target preexisting microthrombi and, when loaded with tPA, facilitate targeted delivery to lyse the microthrombi We hypothesized that this dual action would simultaneously address bleeding and microthrombi with DIC to improve outcomes In vivo, tPAFSNs decreased the presentation of multiorgan microthrombi, recovered platelet counts, and improved bleeding outcomes in a DIC rodent model When incorporated with human DIC patient plasma, tPAFSNs restored clot structure and clot growth under flow Together, these data demonstrate that a fibrinolytic agent loaded into fibrintargeting nanogels could improve DIC outcomes,,,There are trillions of microorganisms in the human body, consisting of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and archaea these collectively make up the microbiome Recent studies suggest that the microbiome may serve as a biomarker for disease, a therapeutic target, or provide an explanation for pathophysiology in lung diseases Studies describing the impact of the microorganisms found in the respiratory tract on lung health have been published and are discussed here in the context of interstitial lung diseases Additionally, epidemiological and experimental evidence highlights the importance of crosstalk between the gut microbiota and the lungs, called the gutlung axis The gutlung axis postulates that alterations in gut microbial communities may have a profound effect on lung disease Dysbiosis in the microbial community of the gut is linked with changes in immune responses, homeostasis in the airways, and inflammatory conditions in the gastrointestinal tract itself In this review, we summarize studies describing the role of the microbiome in interstitial lung disease and discuss the implications of these findings on the diagnosis and treatment of these diseases This paper describes the impact of the microbial communities on the pathogenesis of lung diseases by assessing recent original research and identifying remaining gaps in knowledge,Abstract  Background Users of guidelinerecommended reninangiotensinaldosterone system RAAS inhibitors may experience disruptions to their treatment, eg due to hyperkalaemia, hypotension or acute kidney injury The risks associated with treatment disruption have not been comprehensively assessed therefore, we evaluated the risk of adverse clinical outcomes in RAAS inhibitor users experiencing treatment disruptions in a large populationwide database   Methods This exploratory, retrospective analysis utilized data from the UKs Clinical Practice Research Datalink, linked to Hospital Episodes Statistics and the Office for National Statistics databases Adults 18 years with first RAAS inhibitor use defined as angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2014 were eligible for inclusion Time to the first occurrence of adverse clinical outcomes allcause mortality, allcause hospitalization, cardiac arrhythmia, heart failure hospitalization, cardiac arrest, advancement in chronic kidney disease CKD stage and acute kidney injury was compared between RAAS inhibitor users with and without interruptions or cessations to treatment during followup Associations between baseline characteristics and adverse clinical outcomes were also assessed   Results Among 434 027 RAAS inhibitor users, the risk of the first occurrence of all clinical outcomes, except advancement in CKD stage, was 875 lower in patients without interruptions or cessations versus patients with interruptionscessations Baseline characteristics independently associated with increased risk of clinical outcomes included increasing age, smoking, CKD, diabetes and heart failure   Conclusions These findings highlight the need for effective management of factors associated with RAAS inhibitor interruptions or cessations in patients for whom guidelinerecommended RAAS inhibitor treatment is indicated,,,In December 2019, Coronavirus 2019 due to SARS CoV 2 was first discovered in Wuhan, China and then rapidly spread to more than 200 countries Until now, there is no specific vaccine and no effective treatment, so it is very important from a clinical point of view to predict the evolution of the disease Thus, in order to further analyze the value of the clinical application of blood count parameters in the diagnosis or management of COVID19 Coronavirus disease 2019 patients Peripheral blood abnormalities of 102 COVID19 patients hospitalized in the pneumology department of CHU Mohamed VI in Marrakesh were analyzed retrospectively and compared to SARS CoV 2 negative patients Results WBCs in the patient group were 832 ×109L vs 585 ×109L, p0001, an elevated neutrophil count 533 ×109L vs 327 ×109L, p0 001, a lower hemoglobin concentration 135 1061637 gdl vs 148 135156 gdl, p0001, and a higher Neutrophilstolymphocytes ratio 263 vs 152, p0001 The severe cases had a higher white blood cell count 14,279 6,564 vs 7,471 2,609 ×109L, p0001, a much higher neutrophil count 12,547 6,698 vs 4,468 1,882 ×109L, p0001 Lymphopenia 0851 0406 vs 2138 1103 ×109L, p0001, NLR 1474 vs 208 and Plateletstolymphocytes ratio 145 vs 117 were higher than the nonsevere COVID19 cases Conclusion In light of these data, we deduce that regular monitoring of blood counts should be involved to judge the progression and prognosis of COVID19,ObjectivesInfection with the SARSCOV2 virus COVID19 may be complicated by thrombotic diathesis This complication often involves the pulmonary microcirculation While macrovascular thrombotic complications of the lung may include pulmonary artery embolism, pulmonary artery thrombus in situ has also been hypothesized Pulmonary vein thrombosis has not been described in this contextMethodsResultsHerein, we provide a case of an otherwise healthy male who developed an ischemic stroke with left internal carotid thrombus Further imaging revealed pulmonary emboli with propagation through the pulmonary veins into the left atrium This left atrial thrombus provides a source of atypical paradoxic arterial embolismConclusionsThrombotic outcomes in the setting of severe COVID 19 pneumonia may include macrovascular venous thromboembolism, microvascular pulmonary vascular thrombosis and arterial thromboembolism Pulmonary vein, herein described, provides further mechanistic pathway for potential arterial embolic phenomenon,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 is erupting and spreading globally Cardiovascular complications secondary to the infection have caught notice This study aims to delineate the relationship of cardiac biomarkers and outcomes in severe cases of corona virus disease 2019 COVID19 One hundred fortyeight critically ill adult patients with COVID19 were enrolled From these patients, the demographic data, symptoms, cardiac biomarkers, treatments, and clinical outcomes were collected Data were compared between survivors and nonsurvivors Four patients in the nonsurvivor group were selected, and their cardiac biomarkers were collected and analyzed Among the 148 patients, the incidence of cardiovascular complications was 19 128 Five of them were survivors 52, and 14 of them were nonsurvivors 269 Compared with the survivors, the nonsurvivors had higher levels of highsensitivity cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase isoenzymeMB, myoglobin, and Nterminal probrain natriuretic peptide P  005 The occurrence of cardiovascular events began at 1115 days after the onset of the disease and reached a peak at 1420 days COVID19 not only is a respiratory disease but also causes damage to the cardiovascular system Cardiac biomarkers have the potential for early warning and prognostic evaluation in patients with COVID19 It is recommended that cardiac biomarker monitoring in patients with COVID19 should be initiated at least from the 11th day of the disease course,Pulmonary infection of 2019nCoV can frequently induce acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS with partial pressure of arterial oxygenfraction of inspired oxygen ratio pO2FiO2 of less than 300xa0mmHg Moreover, it can be complicated with cardiac injury or arrhythmia, microvascular and largevessel thrombosis We describe a case of a patient with COVID19ARDS and concomitant critical ischemia of the limbs Iloprost treatment, an analogue of a prostacyclin PGI2, was started for residual left forefoot ischemia after surgical thromboembolectomy Unexpectedly, we documented improvement of respiratory performance and lung high resolution computed tomography HRCT showed significant regression of the diffuse pulmonary groundglass opacity The hypothetical mechanism is that iloprost can enhance perfusion preferentially to wellventilated lung regions, reduce pressures of peripheral pulmonary vessels and induce reduction of lung interstitial edema In addition, iloprost antithrombotic effect, endothelial damage repairing and neoangiogenesis activity could play a relevant role,Highlights    • Several cardiovascularhemostatic disturbances haves been reported in patients with COVID19, but the real frequency and their potential association with the pathogenic mechanisms of SARSCoV19 still remain to be defined   • We investigated the relative frequency of acute coronary syndrome, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke and upper gastrointestinal bleeding in COVID patents attending emergency departments EDs, before hospitalization and compared them with frequencies in the general ED population attending 50 Spanish EDs   • We found that the risk of pulmonary embolism is clearly increased in COVID patients, with an OR of 453 with respect to nonCOVID patients 95 confidence interval 403 510 Additionally, the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was 2 fold more frequent among ED comers in 2020 compared to 2019, suggesting a SARSCoV2 role in such increment of cases The remaining entities studied were not found to be unequivocally increased in the present study and need further investigation,Due to the COVID19 pandemic, the 84thAnnual Meeting of the Japanese Circulation Society JCS was held in a webbased format for the first time in its history as The Week for JCS 2020 from Monday, July 27 to Sunday, August 2, 2020 All sessions, including general abstracts, were streamed live or ondemand The main theme of the meeting was Change Practice and the aim was to organize the latest findings in the field of cardiovascular medicine and discuss how to change practice The total number of registered attendees was over 16,800, far exceeding our expectations, and many of the sessions were viewed by far more people than at conventional facetoface scientific meetings At this conference, the power of online information dissemination was fully demonstrated, and the evolution of online academic meetings will be a direction that cannot be reversed in the future The meeting was completed with great success, and we express our heartfelt gratitude to all affiliates for their enormous amount of work, cooperation, and support,There are limited data regarding direct oral anticoagulants DOACs for stroke prevention in patients with bioprosthetic heart valves BHVs and atrial fibrillation AF The objectives of this study were to evaluate the ambulatory utilization of DOACs and to compare the effectiveness and safety of DOACs versus warfarin in patients with AF and BHVs We conducted a retrospective cohort study at a large integrated health care delivery system in California Patients with BHVs and AF treated with warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban between September 12, 2011 and June 18, 2020 were identified Inverse probability of treatmentweighted comparative effectiveness and safety of DOACs compared with warfarin were determined Use of DOACs gradually increased since 2011, with a significant upward in trend after a stayathome order related to COVID19 Among 2,672 adults with BHVs and AF who met the inclusion criteria, 439 were exposed to a DOAC and 2233 were exposed to warfarin For the primary effectiveness outcome of ischemic stroke, systemic embolism and transient ischemic attack, no significant association was observed between use of DOACs compared with warfarin HR 119, 95 CI 096 to 148, pu202fu202f011 Use of DOACs was associated with lower risk of the primary safety outcome of intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, and other bleed HR 069, 95 CI 056 to 085, p  0001 Results were consistent across multiple subgroups in the sensitivity analyses These findings support the use of DOACs for AF in patients with BHVs,Although results from two major trials trials have shown a clear benefit of gliflozines in the management of heart failure HF irrespective of diabetes status, the mechanism of cardiac benefits remains incompletely understood Gliflozines have an osmotic diuretic effect that differs from that of other diuretic classes, resulting in greater electrolytefree water clearance, and clinical studies have shown that intravascular volume depletion is rare and occurs at similar frequency in the gliflozines and placebo groups As a consequence of the negligible effects on the blood volume and bodys fluid balance compared to diuretics, gliflozines may limit the reflex neurohumoral stimulation and activation of reninangiotensinaldosterone system RAAS Since neurohormonal and RAAS activation in patients with HF reduced or ejection fraction HFrEF and HFpEF also leads to systemic and pulmonary arterial stiffening, pulmonary hypertension PH and PHrelated right ventricular failure, gliflozines may lead to a mitigation of systemic and pulmonary arterial stiffening, which in turn can reduce the degree of PH associated with HFrEF or HFpEF, can improve the ventricular arterial coupling and can reduce the overload of the left and right ventricle, improving their function The current review discusses the latest findings regarding the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on heart failure with focus also on pulmonary hypertension, discussing the molecular mechanisms involved,BACKGROUND Novel corona virus nCoV or Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 is known to cause severe bilateral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS or Corona virus disease2019 COVID19 in patients that can be debilitating and even fatal With no drugs or vaccines available yet, a wide range of treatment regimens used are being repurposed The need of the hour is to analyze various regimens available and devise a treatment plan most effective against SARSCoV2   OBJECTIVE Patient concerns A 68yearold hypertensive, diabetic male, exhibiting symptoms of cough and shortness of breath presented at the emergency department of our hospital Diagnosis Chest CT revealed bilateral ground glass opacities indicative of COVID19 and the CT score of 24 indicated severe pulmonary pneumonia He tested positive for COVID19   METHODS Interventions The treatment regimen included use of convalescent plasma, oxygen therapy, steroids, high dose antibiotics, broad spectrum antiviral Remdesivir, and antiinterleukin6 monoclonal antibodyTocilizumab at various stages of the disease   RESULTS Outcomes Oxygen support was required at the time of admission The patient initially developed cytokine release storm and mechanical ventilation was used to manage his condition Supportive care and multiple treatment regimens were used to successfully recover the patients health   CONCLUSIONS Lessons With a rapid increase in number of confirmed cases worldwide, COVID19 has become a major challenge to our healthcare system With no available vaccines currently, finding a combination of therapeutic drugs which are effective in reducing progression of disease is of utmost importance   CLINICALTRIAL

hypoxic respiratory failure after accidentally ingesting, and subsequently aspirating, vaping liquid while intoxicated Because of the increasing prevalence of vaping devices, this case highlights a unique risk of vape liquids with concentrated nicotine levels and appetizing labels and aromas Vapingassociated pulmonary injury has been previously described in multiple publications, but unlike those patients with pathology after inhaling vaping products, our patient ingested and subsequently aspirated the highly nicotinic substance Most vape liquid products have enough nicotine to result in significant toxicity, which most concerningly can lead to nicotineinduced respiratory failure This patients hypoxia appeared to be multifactorial as a result of both nicotine toxicity and aspiration, but ultimately treatment of both focused on supportive measuresIn addition to understanding nicotine toxicity, this patients hypoxia secondary to agitation and aspiration requiring emergent airway management illustrates the importance of understanding the technique of Delayed Sequence Intubation and its proper application in the critical airway algorithm By treating preoxygenation as a procedure, the patient received adequate oxygenation resulting in successful intubation without harmful desaturation during the procedureGiven the prevalence of tobacco use in the military as well as the increasing popularity of vaping devices, future military providers have a responsibility to their patients to be prepared for similar case presentations Fortunately, this case demonstrates that when managed properly, otherwise healthy patients without comorbidities often recover without significant longterm sequelae,BACKGROUND Pulmonary artery enlargement PAE detected using chest computed tomography CT is associated with poor outcomes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD It is unknown whether nocturnal hypoxemia occurring in smokers, with or without COPD, obstructive sleep apnoea OSA or their overlap, may be associated with PAE assessed by chest CT METHODS We analysed data from two prospective cohort studies that enrolled 284 smokers in lung cancer screening programs and completing baseline home sleep studies and chest CT scans Main pulmonary artery diameter PAD and the ratio of the PAD to that of the aorta PAAo ratio were measured PAE was defined as a PAD  29 mm in men and 27 mm in women or as a PAAo ratio  09 We evaluated the association of PAE with baseline characteristics using multivariate logistic models RESULTS PAE prevalence was 27 as defined by PAD measurements and 116 by the PAAo ratio A body mass index  30 kgm2 OR 201 95CI 106378, lower  predicted of forced expiratory volume in one second FEV1 OR 103 95CI 102105 and higher  of sleep time with O2 saturation  90 T90 OR 102 95CI 100103, were associated with PAE as determined by PAD However, only T90 remained significantly associated with PAE as defined by the PAAo ratio OR 102 95CI 101103 In the subset group without OSA, only T90 remains associated with PAE, whether defined by PAD measurement OR 102 95CI 101103 or PAAo ratio OR 104 95CI 101107 CONCLUSIONS In smokers with or without COPD, nocturnal hypoxemia was associated with PAE independently of OSA coexistence,OBJECTIVEBACKGROUND Changes in sleep architecture in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease COPD can be explained by a combination of physiological changes in breathing during sleep, with impairment of respiratory mechanics and reduction of arterial oxygenation This study aimed to evaluate the acute effects of noninvasive ventilation NIV  compared to spontaneous breathing  on sleep latency and stages, and on the occurrence of sleeprelated respiratory events, nocturnal hypoxemia, and changes in heart rate HR in patients with moderate to severe stable COPD PATIENTSMETHODS Patients completed two polysomnography PSG studies one during spontaneous breathing and one while receiving NIV in bilevel mode and with backup respiratory rate RR setting Sleepware G3 software was used for the analysis of PSG and pressure, volume, and ventilator flow curvesxa0×xa0time RESULTS Participants were 10 female patients with a mean age of 681xa0xa0102 years NIV during sleep decreased sleep onset latency 17xa0xa0188xa0min vs 468xa0xa0395xa0min pxa0xa0002, increased REM sleep time 412xa0xa0247xa0min vs

bpm vs 916xa0xa078 bpm pxa0xa0003 were observed in PSG with NIV CONCLUSIONS The use of NIV in patients with moderate to severe stable COPD while they were sleeping increased REM sleep time and decreased sleep onset latency, the number of obstructive respiratory events, and the mean and maximum HR,BACKGROUND COVID19 has significantly impacted the healthcare landscape in the United States in a variety of ways including a nationwide reduction in operative volume The impact of COVID19 on the availability of donor organs and the impact on solid organ transplant remains unclear We examine the impact of COVID19 on a single, largevolume heart transplant program METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed examining all adult heart transplants performed at a single institution between March 2020 and June 2020 This was compared to the same time frame in 2019 We examined incidence of primary graft dysfunction PGD, continuous renal replacement therapy CRRT and 30day survival RESULTS From MarchJune 2020, 43 orthotopic heart transplants were performed compared to 31 performed during 2019 Donor and recipient demographics demonstrated no differences There was no difference in 30day survival There was a statistically significant difference in incidence of postoperative CRRT 931 v 343 p  01 There was a statistically significant difference in race 23W8B1AA v 30W13B P029 CONCLUSION We demonstrate that a single, largevolume transplant program was able to grow volume with little difference in donor variables and clinical outcomes following transplant While multiple reasons are possible, most likely the reduction of volume at other programs allowed us to utilize organs to which we would not have previously had access More significantly, our growth in volume was coupled with no instances of COVID19 infection or transmission amongst patients or staff due to an aggressive testing and surveillance program,Respiratory diseases and their comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease and muscle atrophy, have been increasing in the world Extracellular vesicles EVs, which include exosomes and microvesicles, are released from almost all cell types and play crucial roles in intercellular communication, both in the regulation of homeostasis and the pathogenesis of various diseases Exosomes are of endosomal origin and range in size from 50 to 150xa0nm in diameter, while microvesicles are generated by the direct outward budding of the plasma membrane in size ranges of 1002,000xa0nm in diameter EVs can contain various proteins, metabolites, and nucleic acids, such as mRNA, noncoding RNA species, and DNA fragments In addition, these nucleic acids in EVs can be functional in recipient cells through EV cargo The endothelium is a distributed organ of considerable biological importance, and disrupted endothelial function is involved in the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension, and acute respiratory distress syndrome Endothelial cellderived EVs ECEVs play crucial roles in both physiological and pathological conditions by traveling to distant sites through systemic circulation This review summarizes the pathological roles of vascular microRNAs contained in ECEVs in respiratory diseases, mainly focusing on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension, and acute respiratory distress syndrome Furthermore, this review discusses the potential clinical usefulness of ECEVs as therapeutic agents in respiratory diseases,,Background The transfusion of convalescent blood products is an age old therapy in emerging infectious disease outbreaks Convalescent plasma works on the principle of passive immunotherapy and Viral Neutralization In the Current pandemic of corona virus disease COVID19, convalescent plasma transfusions can have therapeutic role as there is no specific preventative and therapeutic options This study was done to see the challenges faced by blood transfusion services for recruitment of plasma donors Methods The retrospective study included challenges faced by blood transfusion services in recruiting Donors for convalescent plasma for COVID19 and strategies followed for improving the donation at SMS Medical College and Hospital from April 2020 to October 2020 Results This study evaluated challenges faced to recruit the recently recovered COVID19 patients as donors, Setting up of plasmapheresis capacity, Role of social media in recruitment of Convalescent plasma donors, Financial aspects associated with Convalescent plasma donation, Role of NGOs in recruitment of donors and Success achieved in organization of donor mobilization and plasma collection Conclusions Recruitment of Convalescent Plasma donor from COVID19 recovered patients is a big challenge for blood transfusion services Different strategies to motivate donors should be implemented such as personnel communication, advertisement via classical mass media like radio, poster, newspaper and online media,Coronary artery aneurysms in children were observed as a rare complication associated with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 This case report describes the severe end of the spectrum of the new multisystem inflammatory syndrome in a 12yearold child with coronary aneurysms, myocardial dysfunction, and shock, managed successfully with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support and immunomodulation therapy This report also highlights the additional benefits of cardiac CT in the diagnosis and followup of coronary aneurysms,BACKGROUND In the era of COVID19, travel restrictions and social distancing measures have changed the landscape for device interrogations of pacemakers and defibrillators for rural Victorians Previously, device checks were performed infrequently in large volume, facetoface rural clinics by visiting cardiologists and technicians Access to remote areas and social distancing restrictions have made these clinics unfeasible to operate The Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand CSANZ and Heart Rhythm Society HRS COVID19 consensus statements have suggested the utilisation of remote monitoring to minimise the potential spread of COVID19 infections between clinicians and highrisk patients A novel solution to this challenge was the implementation of a remote device interrogation RI service located in two kiosks at two rural pharmacies This service was termed Remote Device Interrogation Kiosks ReDInK AIM This crosssectional observational study aimed to describe the setup process, safety and efficacy of RI and customer satisfaction of the ReDInK program METHODS Twohundredandninetytwo 292 rurally located patients with implantable cardiac devices were identified via the cardiology department database Of these, 101 44 were enrolled into the ReDInK program across two rurally located pharmacies between April and July 2020 RI was performed and download outcomes were reviewed A customer satisfaction survey assessed attitudes towards the program and explored options of ongoing service application RESULTS Of 101 patients enrolled into ReDInK, 96 95 resulted in satisfactory device checks Four 4 individuals failedtoattend and one individual experienced technical download issues Of the 96 satisfactory device checks, three required inperson followup for reasons including battery replacement, lead repositioning and inperson programming No adverse events were reported A satisfaction telephone survey was conducted with 81 83 participants enrolled in ReDInK Seventyone 71 individuals 88 of those surveyed expressed satisfaction and 73 90 labelled the process as efficiently conducted Sixtynine 69 85 participants felt reassured that this service was established during the pandemic However 47 58 participants reported they would still feel comfortable to undergo inperson reviews despite social distancing recommendations CONCLUSIONS With the COVID19 pandemic posing restrictions to social distancing and reducing unnecessary inperson interaction, the ReDInK program emerges as an efficacious and safe solution for patients in rural Victoria The programs widely positive reception and successful conduction in rural Victoria invites further opportunity for a wider application of similar programs, expanding its role to metropolitan areas,Importance Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2associated cardiac injury has been postulated secondary to several mechanisms While tissue diagnosis is limited during the acute illness, postmortem studies can help boost our understanding and guide management Objective To report the cardiac tissue autopsy findings in coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 decedents Evidence Review Articles published in PubMed and Embase reporting postmortem cardiac pathology of COVID19 decedents till September 2020 We included adult studies excluding preprints The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Case Reports was used to assess quality We extracted gross and histology data as well as the incidence of myocarditis, cardiac ischemia, thrombosis, and dilatation We also looked at the reported cause of death PROSPERO registration CRD42020190898 Findings Fortyone relevant studies identified including 316 cases The deceased were mostly male 62 and elderly median age, 75 range, 2297 years The most common comorbidities were hypertension 48 and coronary artery disease 33 Cardiac pathologies contributed to the death of 15 cases Besides chronic cardiac pathologies, postmortem examination demonstrated cardiac dilatation 20, acute ischemia 8, intracardiac thrombi 25, pericardial effusion 25, and myocarditis 15 SARSCoV2 was detected within the myocardium of 47 of studied hearts Conclusions and Relevance SARSCoV2 can invade the heart, but a minority of cases were found to have myocarditis Cardiac dilatation, ischemia, mural, and microthrombi were the most frequent findings The systematic review was limited by the small number of cases and the quality of the studies, and there is a need to standardize the cardiac postmortem protocols,OBJECTIVE Since the World Health Organization WHO announced coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 had become a global pandemic on March 11, 2020, the number of infections has been increasing The purpose of this metaanalysis was to investigate the prognosis of COVID19 in patients with coronary heart disease METHOD Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched to collect the literature concerning coronary heart disease and COVID19 The retrieval time was from inception to Nov 20, 2020, using Stata version 140 for metaanalysis RESULTS A total of 22,148 patients from 40 studies were included The metaanalysis revealed that coronary heart disease was associated with poor prognosis of COVID19 OR342, 95CI 283, 413, P0001 After subgroup analysis, coronary heart disease was found to be related to mortality OR375, 95CI 291, 482, P0001, severecritical COVID19 OR323, 95CI 219, 477, P0001, ICU admission OR225, 95CI 134, 379, P0002, disease progression OR301, 95CI 146, 622, P0003 Metaregression showed that the association between coronary heart disease and poor prognosis of COVID19 was affected by hypertension P0004, and subgroup analysis showed that compared with the proportion of hypertension 30 OR285, 95CI 233, 349, the proportion of hypertension 30 OR478, 95CI 350, 651 had a higher risk of poor prognosis CONCLUSION Coronary heart disease is a risk factor for poor prognosis in patients with COVID19,,,ACE inhibitors ACEis and angiotensin receptor blockers ARBs are standardofcare treatments for hypertension and diabetes, common comorbidities among hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 Their use in the setting of COVID19 has been heavily debated due to potential interactions with ACE2, an enzyme that links the proinflammatory and antiinflammatory arms of the renin angiotensin system, but also the entryway by which severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 invades cells ACE2 expression is altered by age, hypertension, diabetes, and the virus itself This study integrated available information about the renin angiotensin aldosterone system RAAS and effects of SARSCoV2 and its comorbidities on ACE2 into a mechanistic mathematical model and aimed to quantitatively predict effects of ACEiARBs on the RAAS proinflammatoryantiinflammatory balance RAAS blockade prior to SARSCoV2 infection is predicted to increase the masAT1 receptor occupancy ratio up to 20fold, indicating that in patients already taking an ACEiARB before infection, the antiinflammatory arm is already elevated while the proinflammatory arm is suppressed Predicted proinflammatory shifts in the masAT1 ratio due to ACE2 downregulation by SARSCoV2 were small relative to antiinflammatory shifts induced by ACEiARB Predicted effects of changes in ACE2 expression with comorbidities of diabetes, hypertension, or aging on masAT1 occupancy ratio were also relatively small Last, predicted changes in the angiotensin Ang17 production rate with ACEiARB therapy, comorbidities, or infection were all small relative to exogenous Ang17 infusion rates shown experimentally to protect against acute lung injury, suggesting that any changes in the ACE2Ang17mas arm may not be large enough to play a major role in COVID19 pathophysiology,Background COVID19 pandemic impacted on heart failure patients lifestyle and quality of life, affecting both physical activity levels and state of health Methods Demographic data and device records were extracted for patients with heart failure in the 16xa0weeks at the turn of lockdown during pandemic To explore the variability across the lockdown period, a weektoweek analysis was performed Patients were interviewed to investigate physical activity and psychological insights The primary endpoint was the variation in physical activity at the turn of lockdown Results At our facility, 2225 patients implanted with a cardiac device were screened and data were collected for 211 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria Patients physical activity significantly decreased in the lockdown period compared with the control period active time per day 80 vs 108 relative reduction RRR 259 p,Although the attention of the world and the global health community specifically is deservedly focused on the COVID19 pandemic, other determinants of health continue to have large impacts and may also interact with COVID19 Air pollution is one crucial example Established evidence from other respiratory viruses and emerging evidence for COVID19 specifically indicates that air pollution alters respiratory defense mechanisms leading to worsened infection severity Air pollution also contributes to comorbidities that are known to worsen outcomes amongst those infected with COVID19, and air pollution may also enhance infection transmission due to its impact on more frequent coughing Yet despite the massive disruption of the COVID19 pandemic, there are reasons for optimism broad societal lockdowns have shown us a glimpse of what a future with strong air pollution measures could yield Thus, the urgency to combat air pollution is not diminished, but instead heightened in the context of the pandemic,BACKGROUND There is growing evidence regarding the imaging findings of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 in chest Xrays and computed tomography scans however, their availability during this pandemic outbreak might be compromised Currently, the role of pointofcare ultrasonography POCUS has yet to be explored OBJECTIVES To describe the POCUS findings of COVID19 in patients with the disease admitted to the emergency department ED, correlating them with vital signs, laboratory and radiologic results, therapeutic decisions, and the prognosis METHODS Prospective study performed in the ED of 2 academic hospitals Patients with highly suspected or confirmed COVID19 underwent a lung ultrasonography lung POCUS, focused cardiac ultrasound FOCUS, and inferior vena cava IVC exam RESULTS Between March and April 2020, 96 patients were enrolled The mean age was 682 years SD 175 The most common findings in the lung POCUS were an irregular pleural line 632, bilateral confluence 552, and isolated Blines 531, which were associated with a positive RTPCR odds ratio 4327 95 CI 121615401 p,,Although the attention of the world and the global health

SARSCoV2 infection ranges from asymptomatic to critical forms and several prognostic factors have been described Atrial fibrillation AF is common in acute situations where it is linked with more complications and mortality We aimed to evaluate the prognostic information of AF in this population METHODS retrospective analysis of a cohort of 517 patients consecutively admitted in a tertiary hospital due to SARSCoV2 infection We divided the patients in two groups according the development of AF and compared the main features of both groups An univariable and multivariable analysis of mortality were also performed RESULTS among 517 patients with SARSCoV2 infection admitted in a tertiary center, 54 104 developed AF These patients are older 816 vs 665 years old, p0001 and present more hypertension 74 vs 47, p0001, cardiomyopathy 9 vs 1, p0002, previous heart failure admission 9 vs 04, p0001, previous episodes of AF 83 vs 1, p0001 and bigger left atrium 478 vs 399mm, p0001 AF COVID19 patients present more acute respiratory failure 72 vs 40, p0001 and higher inhospital mortality 50 vs 22, p0001 Predictors of AF development are age and previous AF AF is not an independent predictor of inhospital mortality Predictors are age, creatinine15mgdL at admission, LDH250UIL at admission and acute respiratory failure CONCLUSION Atrial fibrillation appears in 10 of hospitalized patients with SARSCoV2 infection These patients present more comorbidities and twofold increase in hospital mortality Atrial fibrillation is not an independent prognostic factor,,Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2 is the bindingsite and entrypoint for SARSCoV2 in human and highly expressed in the lung Cigarette smoking CS is the leading cause of pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases Chronic CS leads to upregulation of bronchial ACE2 inducing a high vulnerability in COVID19 smoker patients Interestingly, CSinduced dysregulation of pulmonary reninangiotensin system RAS in part contributing into the potential pathogenesis COVID19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS Since, CSmediated ACE2 activations is not the main pathway for increasing the risk of COVID19, it appeared that AngIIAT1R might induce an inflammatoryburst in COVID19 response by upregulating cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase type 4 PDE4, which hydrolyses specifically the second intracellular messenger 3, 5cyclic AMP cAMP It must be pointed out that CS might induce PDE4 upregulation similarly to the COVID19 inflammation, and therefore could potentiate COVID19 inflammation opening the potential therapeutic effects of PDE4 inhibitor in both COVID19inflammation and CS,Acute stridor is often an airway emergency We present a valuable experience handling an elderly woman who was initially treated as COVID19 positive during the pandemic in November 2020 She needed an urgent tracheostomy due to nasopharyngeal NP diffuse large Bcell lymphoma causing acute airway obstruction Fortunately, 1u2009hour later, her NP swab realtime PCR test result returned as SARSCoV2 negative This interesting article depicts the importance of adequate preparations when handling potentially infectious patients with anticipated difficult airway and the perioperative issues associated with it,BackgroundSARSCoV2 virus which targets the pulmonary vasculature is supposed to induce an intrapulmonary right to left shunt with an increased pulmonary blood flow Such vascular injury is difficult to observe because it is hidden by the concomitant lung injury We report here what may be, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of a pure Covid19 related Acute Vascular Distress Syndrome AVDSCase presentationA 43yearold physician, tested positive for Covid19, was addressed to the emergency unit for severe dyspnoea and dizziness Explorations were non informative with only a doubt regarding a subsegmental pulmonary embolism no groundglass lesions or consolidations related to Covid19 disease Dyspnoea persisted despite anticoagulation therapy and normal pulmonary function tests Contrastenhanced transthoracic echocardiography was performed which revealed a moderate late righttoleft shuntConclusionsThis case report highlights the crucial importance of the vascular component of the viral disease The intrapulmonary shunt induced by Covid19 which remains unrecognized because generally hidden by the concomitant lung injury, can persist for a long time Contrastenhanced transthoracic echocardiography is the most appropriate test to propose in case of persistent dyspnoea in Covid19 patients,Pneumonia and inflammatory diseases of the pulmonary system such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality globally While the etiology of these diseases is highly different, they share a number of similarities in the underlying inflammatory processes driving disease pathology Multiple recent studies have identified failures in efferocytosisthe phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cellsas a common driver of inflammation and tissue destruction in these diseases Effective efferocytosis has been shown to be important for resolving inflammatory diseases of the lung and the subsequent restoration of normal lung function, while many pneumoniacausing pathogens manipulate the efferocytic system to enhance their growth and avoid immunity Moreover, some treatments used to manage these patients, such as inhaled corticosteroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the prevalent use of statins for cardiovascular disease, have been found to beneficially alter efferocytic activity in these patients In this review, we provide an overview of the efferocytic process and its role in the pathophysiology and resolution of pneumonia and other inflammatory diseases of the lungs, and discuss the utility of existing and emerging therapies for modulating efferocytosis as potential treatments for these diseases,Although Atrial Fibrillation AF is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, its early identification, diagnosis, and treatment is still challenging Due to its heterogeneous mechanisms and riskfactors, targeting an individualized treatment of AF demands a large amount of patient data to identify specific patterns Artificial Intelligence AI algorithms are particularly well suited for treating highdimensional data, predicting outcomes and, eventually, optimizing strategies for patient management The analysis of large patient samples combining different sources of information such as blood biomarkers, electrical signals and medical images opens a new paradigm for improving diagnostic algorithms In this review, we summarize suitable AI techniques for this purpose In particular, we describe potential applications for understanding the structural and functional bases of the disease, as well as for improving early noninvasive diagnosis, developing more efficient therapies, and predicting longterm clinical outcomes of AF patients,BACKGROUND The first admission for acute heart failure with preserved ejection fraction HFpEF drastically influences the shortterm prognosis Baseline characteristics may predict repeat hospitalization or death in these patients METHODS A 103 patientcohort, admitted for the first acute HFpEF episode, was monitored for six months Baseline characteristics were recorded and their relation to the primary outcome of heart failure readmission HFR and secondary outcome of allcause mortality was assessed RESULTS We identified six independent determinants for HFR estimated glomerular filtration rate eGFR p  007, hemoglobin p  004, left ventricle enddiastolic diameter LVEDD p  007, Ee ratio p  0004, left ventricle outflow tract velocitytime integral LVOT VTI p  0045, and diabetes mellitus p  006 Three of the variables were used to generate a risk score for HFR LVEDD, Ee, LVOT VTI DEI Score   28763  4558 × log LVEDD mm  1961 × log Ee ratio  1759 × log LVOT VTI cm Our model predicts a relative amount of 2050 of HFR during the first 6 months after the first acute hospitalization within the general population with HFpEF with a DEI Score over 0747 CONCLUSIONS We have identified three echocardiographic parameters LVEDD, Ee, and LVOT VTI that predict HFR following an initial acute HFpEF hospitalization The prognostic DEI score demonstrated good accuracy,,Deviated nasal septum and turbinate hypertrophy are the most common causes for nasal obstruction, which compromise nasal airflow and increases airway resistance These conditions can further reduce the airflow to lung, which will affect the lung volume and function subsequently reduces the exercise tolerance The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of upper airway surgeries like septoplasty and turbinoplasty on lower airway functions using simple tests like spirometry and 6xa0min walking test 6mWt This research was a prospective study There were 88 subjects in the study who completed follow up Spirometry and 6mWt was performed 1xa0day before and 1xa0month after surgery in all subjects Mean preoperative and postoperative values of spirometry forced vital capacity FVC,forced expiratory volume in 1xa0s FEV1, forced expiratory volume in 1xa0s forced vital capacity FEV1FVC, peak expiratory flow rate PEFR and 6mWt systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation parameters were compared and analyzed Percentage of improvement of each parameter was compared with the type of surgery, side of obstruction, age of the patient and duration of symptom Spirometry showed statistically significant improvement in all 4 parameters after surgery in 86 subjects 6mWt showed statistically significant improvement in SBP and SpO2 and there was no significant improvement in DBP and HR We also observed that improvement in parameters was irrespective of age and duration of symptoms So this study concludes that airway narrowing nasal diseases can compromise lower airway function,BACKGROUND Air pollution is a global health concern PM25, a component of ambient air pollution,has been identified by the World Health Organization as one of the pollutants that poses the greatest threat to public healthCardiovascular health effects have been extensively documented and these effects are still researched AIMS To provide an overview of recent literature regarding air pollutionassociated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in humans Additionally, potential mechanisms through which air pollutants affect the cardiovascular system are discussed based on human, and additional animal studies METHODOLOGY We used the strategy of a narrative review to summarize the scientific literature of studies that were published in the last 7 years Searches were carried out on PubMed and Web of Science using predefined search queries RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We obtained an initial set of 800 publications that were filtered to 78 publications that were relevant to include in this review Analysis of the literature showed significant associations between air pollution, especially PM25, and the risk of elevated blood pressure BP, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction MI, cardiac arrhythmia and heart failure HF, respectively Prominent mechanisms that underlie the adverse effects of air pollution include oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, autonomic imbalance and thrombogenicity CONCLUSIONS The current review underscores the relevance of air pollution as a global health concern that affects cardiovascular health More rigorous standardsare needed to reduce the cardiovascular disease burden imposed by air pollution Continued research on the health impact of air pollution is needed to provide further insight,The discovery of Sanal flow choking in the cardiovascular‐system calls for multidisciplinary and global action to develop innovative treatments and to develop new drugs to negate the risk of asymptomatic‐cardiovascular‐diseases Herein, it is shown that when blood‐pressure‐ratio BPR reaches the lower‐critical‐hemorrhage‐index LCHI internal‐flow‐choking and shock wave generation can occur in the cardiovascular‐system, with sudden expansiondivergencevasospasm or bifurcation regions, without prejudice to the percutaneous‐coronary‐intervention PCI Analytical findings reveal that the relatively high and the low blood‐viscosity are cardiovascular‐risk factors In vitro studies have shown that nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide gases are dominant in fresh blood samples of humansguinea pigs at a temperature range of 986104 F An in silico study demonstrated the Sanal flow choking phenomenon leading to shock‐wave generation and pressure‐overshoot in the cardiovascular‐system It has been established that disproportionate blood‐thinning treatment increases the risk of the internal‐flow‐choking due to the enhanced boundary‐layer‐blockage‐factor, resulting from an increase in flow‐turbulence level in the cardiovascular‐system, caused by an increase in Reynolds number as a consequence of low blood‐viscosity The cardiovascular‐risk can be diminished by concurrently lessening the viscosity of biofluidblood and flow‐turbulence by raising the thermal‐tolerance‐level in terms of blood‐heat‐capacity‐ratio BHCR andor by decreasing the systolic‐to‐diastolic blood‐pressure‐ratio It has been shown that at a critical systolic‐to‐diastolic blood‐pressure‐ratio, the internal‐flow‐choking biofluidSanal‐flow‐choking can occur anywhere in the cardiovascular‐system with or without a plaque or stent The uneven usage of blood‐thinning drugs increases cardiovascular‐risk because low blood‐viscosity is a risk‐factor for internal‐flow‐choking causing the shock‐wave generation at a critical‐pressure‐ratio,The diffuse cystic lung diseases DCLDs are a diverse group of lung disorders characterized by thinwalled parenchymal lucencies with a welldefined interface with normal lung Emphysema, bronchiectasis, fibrotic lung disease, and cavitary lung diseases can also produce parenchymal lucencies that can mimic true DCLDs A variety of lowgrade or highgrade metastasizing neoplasms, polyclonal or monoclonal lymphoproliferative disorders or plasma cell dyscrasias, infections, autoimmune or connective tissue diseases, smokingrelated lung disorders, and congenital or developmental defects can present with DCLD The operating principle for this book is that the presentation, differential diagnosis, and management for the DCLDs differ from the interstitial lung diseases, and should be classified separately,We report a case of COVID19 in a pediatric patient with systemic lupus erythematosus SLE, who presented with respiratory distress marked by increased work of breathing and low oxygen saturation Lab tests confirmed COVID19, and showed lymphocytopenia and elevated markers of inflammation and coagulopathy Chest Xray showed bilateral midlung opacities, and the patient required intubation early in his disease course Imaging and clinical findings were consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS with inflammation The patient was treated with different combinations of antivirals hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir, cytokine inhibitors anakinra and tocilizumab, glucocorticoids hydrocortisone and methylprednisolone, and an anticoagulant enoxaparin Inflammatory markers decreased before clinical improvement in lung aeration This case highlights the potential for pediatric patients with SLE to present with COVID19 similar to the clinical presentation described in adults,Abstract This collaborative statement from

lung disease ILD, compared to those due to severe infection However, those subphenotypes, which follow irreversible lung injury, remain poorly characterized We aimed to examine their clinical and radiological features, in patients who could not withdraw from ventilation after receiving any treatment defined asirreversible respiratory failure Methods Retrospective study including all patients receiving CT evaluation at onset and invasive mechanical ventilation for severe infection or acute ILD, who admitted our institution from April 2013 to May 2019 Participants were divided into Infection group and ILD group according to the dominant cause, and predictors of irreversible respiratory failure were examined among those subjects In addition, we quantitatively evaluated the changes in lung region volumes and dispersion of grand glass opacity, using automated methods Results 31 patients were subdivided to ILD group, whereas 139 patients were subdivided to Infection group Significantly more subjects in ILD group developed irreversible respiratory failure n22 709, compared to those in Infection group n27 194 p0001 With validation of radiological features in those subjects, distinct CT findings, including lung contractive change and nonedematous lung injury NELI, were found in both groups Lung contractive change was observed with 23 subjects in ILD group 742 and 7 subjects in Infection group 50 Among those, 10 lung volume reduction was confirmed by CT analysis with 19 subjects in ILD group and 4 subjects in Infection group By multivariate logistic regression analysis, the following factors were found to be strong predictors of irreversible respiratory failure lung contractive change odds ratio OR326 95 confidence interval CI, 71150, NELI

subphenotypes in acute respiratory failure due to ILD and severe infection, which followed an irreversible course with distinctive radiological features including lung contractive changes,PURPOSE OF REVIEW To search for evidence on whether having asthma increases the risk of poor outcomes of COVID19 and report on recommendations on optimal asthma management in times of COVID19 RECENT FINDINGS Patients with asthma are neither at greater risk of becoming infected by SARSCoV2 nor they are at risk of complications of COVID19 but those requiring frequent use of oral corticosteroid may be at greater risk SUMMARY In general, patients with asthma are not at risk of COVID19 morbidity or mortality On the contrary, patients with asthma may be at lower risk of hospitalizations during the COVID19 pandemic This may be related to asthma and its treatment, to patients behavior, to the health system, and to collective changes in activities It is likely that reduction in respiratory infections because of social distancing, face masks, and hand washing have a role in the reduction in asthma hospitalizations Management of asthma in times of COVID19 must be optimized, medication have to be used regularly and exacerbations detected early Systemic corticosteroids may be used for control of severe asthma or severe exacerbations Patient education on an action plan is crucial, as well as facilitating communications with the healthcare team,Although the attention of the world and the global health community specifically is deservedly focused on the COVID19 pandemic, other determinants of health continue to have large impacts and may also interact with COVID19 Air pollution is one crucial example Established evidence from other respiratory viruses and emerging evidence for COVID19 specifically indicates that air pollution alters respiratory defense mechanisms leading to worsened infection severity Air pollution also contributes to comorbidities that are known to worsen outcomes among those infected with COVID19, and air pollution may also enhance infection transmission due to its impact on more frequent coughing Yet despite the massive disruption of the COVID19 pandemic, there are reasons for optimism broad societal lockdowns have shown us a glimpse of what a future with strong air pollution measures could yield Thus, the urgency to combat air pollution is not diminished, but instead heightened in the context of the pandemic,Convalescent plasma, which contains antibodies from recovered individuals, has been used as an effective treatment for infectious diseases in the past and is currently being used as a potential treatment option for COVID19 Multiple studies have reported this treatment to be safe We report a case of a patient who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS with features suggestive of transfusionrelated acute lung injury after being treated with convalescent plasma for COVID19 We emphasise the need to be aware of the potential risk of transfusion reactions and disease worsening with convalescent plasma administration and to weigh the risk and benefits of this therapy before administration to patients and propose that further study be done regarding the potential risks of convalescent plasma,BACKGROUND Clinicians evaluating acute PE patients often have to identify risks for massive PE, a measure of hemodynamic instability and its consequence, massive PE related adverse clinical events PEACE We investigated the association of these risk factors with massive PE and PEACE in a consecutive PE cohort nxa0xa0364 METHODS Massive PE was defined as an acute central clot proximal to the lobar artery in a patient with right heart strain and systolic blood pressurexa0xa090xa0mg PEACE was defined as any massive PE who died or required one or more of the following ACLS, assisted ventilation, vasopressor use, thrombolytic therapy, or invasive thrombectomy, within seven days of PE diagnosis Univariate and multivariate analysis assessing associations between the risk factors age, gender, comorbidities, PE provoking risks, and whether the PE was felt to be idiopathic and massive PE or PEACE were performed Significance was determined at p,ABSTRACT  Purpose The awake prone position PP strategy for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS is a safe, simple, and costeffective technique used to improve hypoxemia We aimed to evaluate the relationship between awake PP AP and endotracheal intubation in patients with coronavirus disease COVID19   Methods  In this retrospective, multicentre observational study conducted between 1 May and 12 June 2020 in 27 hospitals in Mexico and Ecuador, nonintubated patients with COVID19 managed with AP or awake supine positioning AS were included to evaluate intubation and mortality risk in AP patients through logistic regression models multivariable adjustment, propensity score analyses, and Evalues were calculated to limit confounding A CART model with crossvalidation was also built This study was registered at httpsclinicaltrialsgovct2showNCT04407468    Results  827 nonintubated patients with COVID19 in the AP n505 and AS n322 groups were included for analysis Less patients in the AP group required endotracheal intubation 236 vs 404 or died 20 vs 379 AP was a protective factor for intubation even after multivariable adjustment OR039, 95CI028056, p00001, Evalue201, which prevailed after propensity score analysis OR032, 95CI021049, p00001, Evalue221, and mortality adjusted OR038, 95CI025057, p00001, Evalue198 The main variables associated with PP failure in AP patients were age, lower SpO 2 FiO 2 , and management with a nonrebreather mask In the CART model, only two variables were used SpO 2 FiO 2 F 977, p0001 and PP X2 505, p0001, with an overall percentage of 752    Conclusion PP in awake hospitalised patients with COVID19 is associated with a lower risk of intubation and mortality,Certainly, the respiratory clinical smptomatology remains the most classic, however, covid 19 is recently considered to be a vasculitis affecting several organs, and which is the origin of other extrapulmonary manifestations, in particular thromboembolic disease both venous and arterial which has increasingly become a dramatic complication to be feared during this pandemic, due to its negative impact on the prognosis of affected patients, increasing the need for intentive care and the death rateThe mechanism is multifactorial, associating endothelial damage, an abnormality of hemostasis, and immunothrobosis1We report the case of a 39yearold female patient who had aacute ischemic stroke AIS by embolization of a thrombus located in the left ventricle, whose hiscovid 19 disease was subsequently diagnosed, and whose evolution was later marked by clinical worsening, so the patient was transferred to intensive careThe interest of this case report is to show the need to acquire the reflex to think about a covid 19 disease in case of AIS especially for the young even in the absence of other obvious respiratory signs, as well as to shed light on the mechanism and the particularity of diagnostic and therapeutic management of this kind of complications,OBJECTIVE To identify factors associated with hypertension control among treated middleaged UK adults METHODS A crosssectional populationbased study including 99 468 previously diagnosed, treated hypertensives enrolled in the UK Biobank Hypertension control was defined as systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg RESULTS Median age was 623 years IQR 573 to 660, 459 female, 920 white, 401 obese, 93 current smokers and 194 had prior cardiovascular disease 381 95 CI 378 to 384 were controlled In multivariable logistic regression, associations with lack of hypertension control included older age OR 061, 95 CI 058 to 064 for 6069 years compared with age 4050 years, higher alcohol use OR 061, 95 CI 058 to 064, for consuming 30 units per week compared with none, black ethnicity OR 073, 95 CI 065 to 082 compared with white, obesity OR 073, 95 CI 071 to 076 compared with normal body mass index The strongest positive association with control was having 3 comorbidities OR 209, 95 CI 195 to 223 Comorbidities associated with control included cardiovascular disease OR 211, 95 CI 204 to 219, migraines OR 168, 95 CI 156 to 181, diabetes OR 132, 95 CI 127 to 136 and depression OR 127, 95 CI 120 to 134 CONCLUSIONS In one of the largest populationbased analyses of middleaged adults with measured blood pressure, the majority of treated hypertensives were uncontrolled Risk factors for hypertension were associated with a lower probability of control Having a comorbidity was associated with higher probability of control, possibly due to more frequent interaction with the healthcare system andor appropriate management of those at greater cardiovascular risk,COVID19, caused by the virus SARSCoV2, is a significant challenge to health systems worldwide Its severity appears to be most likely caused by acute inflammation and widespread intravascular coagulation A recent review examines the molecular basis underlying coagulation and inflammation in COVID19 Phosphatidylserine PtdSer typically lies in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane in healthy cells Under some physiological conditions, PtdSer exposure on the outer leaflet of platelets promotes coagulation factor aggregation However, in pathophysiological conditions, PtdSer exposure may cause excessive activation of coagulation and in viral infections, this may increase infectivity and viral spread Evidence suggests that SARSCoV2 exposure may upregulate PtdSer on cell surfaces throughout the body causing disseminated coagulation throughout the body In addition, the virus may upregulate the activity of the protein ADAM17, which has roles in protecting the heart but can also promote inflammation This level of inflammation can be connected to acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS, another leading cause of death among patients with COVID19 Although more clinical evidence is needed to confirm a causal connection between SARSCoV2 infection and PtdSer translocation better understanding of these mechanisms will help to identify new therapeutic targets against COVID19,Coronavirus disease 2019 or most commonly known as COVID19 is a trending global infectious disease which a few months ago was affirmed as a global health emergency or a pandemic by the WHO Emergency Committee The common symptoms manifested in this pandemic disease are high grade fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath and flu like symptom which can evolve into severe respiratory disorders such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS andor endorgan failure Factors that contribute to the severity or high mortality rate in COVID19 include old age, comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, neutrophilia, and organ and coagulation dysfunction Disseminated intravascular coagulation and other various coagulopathies including Venous thromboembolism have known to become a major contributing factor to high mortality rate Venous thromboembolism is a disease which is a combination of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism Prophylactic anticoagulation in patients prone to or with a preexisting history of venous thromboembolism is associated with decreased mortality in severe COVID19 pneumonia This review article focuses upon COVID19 and increased incidence of venous thromboembolism in patients infected by COVID19 along with the role it has in high mortality rate in COVID19 patients,At the heart of IT security is a simple concept  proving you are who you say you are In this context, you might be a human logging into a network or service, a device interacting with an application programming interface API, one network talking to another or any number of other scenarios And the proof could be a certificate, an SSH key, a token of some form or our old favourite  and inevitably the artefact well be talking most about here  the old, fragile and yet seemingly unkillable password At the heart of IT security is a simple concept  proving that you are who you say you are But the ways we have of doing that, through credentials of some form, are flawed Credential abuse comes in many forms The question we need to ask is, where does it sit in terms of an organisations attack surface and security priorities In the first of a twopart feature, Steve MansfieldDevine surveys a number of industry experts to get their views on what forms of credential abuse are being encountered and the threat these pose to enterprises,Each week, I record audio

cell disease in the pandemic era They comment on some common clinical situations in these two diseases which may delay or confuse the diagnosis of COVID19 in patients with sickle cell disease We consider that people with sickle cell disease are part of the risk group for the complications of COVID19 and the topic should be addressed in the scientific literature Resumo Os autores trazem reflexões sobre as pessoas com doença falciforme na era da pandemia Eles comentam algumas situações clínicas comuns nessas duas doenças que podem retardar ou confundir o diagnóstico de COVID19 em pacientes com doença falciforme Consideramos que as pessoas com doença falciforme fazem parte do grupo de risco para complicações da COVID19 e o tema deve ser abordado na literatura científica,,,,,Aim To assess differences in qualitative and quantitative parameters of pulmonary perfusion from dualenergy computed tomography CT pulmonary angiography DECTPA in patients with COVID19 pneumonia with and without pulmonary embolism PE Materials and methods This retrospective institutional review boardapproved study included 74 patients mean age 61xa0xa018 years, malefemale 3440 with COVID19 pneumonia in two countries one with 68 patients, and the other with six patients who underwent DECTPA on either dualsource DS or singlesource SS multidetector CT machines Images from DSDECTPA were processed to obtain virtual monoenergetic 40 keV Mono40, material decomposition iodine MDI images and quantitative perfusion statistics QPS Two thoracic radiologists determined CT severity scores based on type and extent of pulmonary opacities, assessed presence of PE, and pulmonary parenchymal perfusion on MDI images The QPS were calculated from the CT Lung Isolation prototype Siemens The correlated clinical outcomes included duration of hospital stay, intubation, SpO2 and death The significance of association was determined by receiver operating characteristics and analysis of variance Results Onefifth 202, 1574 patients had pulmonary arterial filling defects most filling defects were occlusive 2844 located in the segmental and subsegmental arteries The parenchymal opacities were more extensive and denser CT severity score 24xa0xa04 in patients with arterial filling defects than without filling defects 20xa0xa08 p0028 Groundglass opacities demonstrated increased iodine distribution mixed and consolidative opacities had reduced iodine on DSDECTPA but increased or heterogeneous iodine content on SSDECTPA QPS were significantly lower in patients with low SpO2 p0003, intubation p0006, and pulmonary arterial filling defects p0007 Conclusion DECTPA QPS correlated with clinical outcomes in COVID19 patients,The incidence of venous thrombosis, mostly pulmonary embolism PE, ranging from local immunothrombosis to central emboli, but also deep vein thrombosis DVT in people with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID‐19 is reported to be remarkably high The relevance of better understanding, predicting, treating, and preventing COVID‐19associated venous thrombosis meets broad support, as can be concluded from the high number of research, review, and guideline papers that have been published on this topic The Dutch COVID  Thrombosis Coalition DCTC is a multidisciplinary team involving a large number of Dutch experts in the broad area of venous thrombosis and hemostasis research, combined with experts on virology, critically ill patients, pulmonary diseases, and community medicine, across all university hospitals and many community hospitals in the Netherlands Within the consortium, clinical data of at least 5000 admitted COVID‐19infected individuals are available, including substantial collections of biobanked materials in an estimated 3000 people In addition to considerable experience in preclinical and clinical thrombosis research, the consortium embeds virology‐hemostasis research models within unique biosafety facilities to address fundamental questions on the interaction of virus with epithelial and vascular cells, in relation to the coagulation and inflammatory system The DCTC has initiated a comprehensive research program to answer many of the current questions on the pathophysiology and best anticoagulant treatment of COVID‐19associated thrombotic complications The research program was funded by grants of the Netherlands Thrombosis Foundation and the Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development Here, we summarize the design and main aims of the research program,,Coordinated preconception through postpartum cardioobstetrics care is necessary to optimize both maternal and fetal health Maternal mortality in the United States is increasing, largely driven by increasing cardiovascular CV disease burden during pregnancy and needs to be addressed emergently Both for women with congenital and acquired heart disease, CV complications during pregnancy are associated with increased future risk of CV disease Comprehensive cardioobstetrics care is a powerful way of ensuring that womens CV risks before and during pregnancy are appropriately identified and treated and that they remain engaged in CV care long term to prevent future CV complications,,,Background Early identification and timely therapeutic strategies for potential critical patients with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 are of crucial importance to reduce mortality We aimed to develop and validate a prediction tool for 30day mortality for these patients on admission Methods Consecutive hospitalized patients admitted to Tongji Hospital and Hubei Xinhua Hospital from January 1 to March 10, 2020, were retrospective analyzed They were grouped as derivation and external validation set Multivariate Cox regression was applied to identify the risk factors associated with death, and a nomogram was developed and externally validated by calibration plots, Cindex, KaplanMeier curves and decision curve Results Data from 1,717 patients at the Tongji Hospital and 188 cases at the Hubei Xinhua Hospital were included in our study Using multivariate Cox regression with backward stepwise selection of variables in the derivation cohort, age, sex, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD, as well as seven biomarkers aspartate aminotransferase, highsensitivity Creactive protein, highsensitivity troponin I, white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, Ddimer, and procalcitonin were incorporated in the model An age, biomarkers, clinical history, sex ABCSmortality score was developed, which yielded a higher Cindex than the conventional CURB65 score for predicting 30day mortality in both the derivation cohort 0888 95 confidence interval CI, 08690907 vs 0696 95 CI, 06600731 and validation cohort 0838 95 CI, 07770899 vs 0619 95 CI, 05190720, respectively Furthermore, risk stratified KaplanMeier curves showed good discriminatory capacity of the model for classifying patients into distinct mortality risk groups for both derivation and validation cohorts Conclusions The ABCSmortality score might be offered to clinicians to strengthen the prognosisbased clinical decisionmaking, which would be helpful for reducing mortality of COVID19 patients,,OBJECTIVE Although pulmonary involvement represents the primary and most characteristic presentation of SarsCov2 infection, due to its innate tropism for endothelium, it is also associated with systemic procoagulative changes and thromboses This paper describes a COVID19 atypical presentation with massive thrombotic occlusion of the splenoportalmesenteric axis and the splenic artery in the absence of clinical or radiological manifestation of pulmonary involvement PATIENTS AND METHODS Female patient, with no history of disease, trauma or fever in the last 30 days, was admitted to ER for persistent left subcostal pain Laboratory exams, including inflammation, coagulation markers and SarsCoV2 serology, were requested Wholebody CT with contrast media injection was performed RESULTS Laboratory exams showed elevated reactive Cprotein, bilirubin, γGT and Ddimer Wholebody CT showed splenic artery occlusion, thrombosis of splenic, mesenteric and portal veins with portal intrahepatic branches ectasia, juxtahilar portal cavernomatosis of probable acute onset absence of signs of chronic hepatopathy and of varices, a hypodense area in the spleen indicating ischemic parenchymal suffering The patient resulted positive for SarsCoV2 IgG, thus in the absence of typical clinics or pulmonary parenchymal abnormality at chest CT CONCLUSIONS A case of acute venous thrombosis and arterial occlusion as primary manifestations of COVID19,In this work, two new, low cost, lightweight and simple pneumatic portable mechanical ventilator prototypes that offer minimal oxygen consumption were presented in support of treatment during the novel coronavirus COVID19 epidemic of 2020 The prototypes were implemented in ANSYS 180 and evaluated using Expert Systems 110 software Both prototypes devices were found appropriate for all patients with difficulty breathing, which for patients with COVID19, includes those with all severities of illness, recovery levels, and ages, no matter what the capacity of the patients respiratory system To ensure the safety of the designed devices, the airway oxygen sensors, valves, and analysers were equipped with programmable alarms and other controllable safety attachments, including a modification to enable the delivery of nitric oxide NO for a specified therapy treatment recommended for respiratory failure The overall prototype device capacity was obtained in terms of tidal volumemin TV, which was between 02 to 16 Ibreath, suggesting that the device can be used treat patients of all ages, from children to adults The prototype device has a range of 10 to 40 breathsmin bpm, and for normal spontaneous breathing, at an expiratory to inspiratory ratio EI  21, the designed prototype can produce a total tidal volume between 202 to 3232 lmin For patients with moderate breathing difficulties, ie with EI ratios of 11, between 303 to 4848 lmin was estimated, with between 404 to 6464 lmin for those with high severity of breathing issues, ie those with higher EI ratios above 21 The designed ventilator can also be used for most oxygen consumption durations as it uses any oxygen fraction concentration of inspired oxygenenriched in gas FIO2 at an efficiency at least 042 higher than previous similar and standard ventilator devices,Concomitant acute myocarditis and acute coronary thrombosis is a rare presentation of acute chest pain in the emergency department, although the association between acute infections with a variety of pathogens and an increased risk of myocardial infarction has been reported A case of acute myocardial infarction associated with acute myocarditis caused by coronavirus 229E in a middleaged man without risk factors for coronary artery disease is described here Coronary CT angiography with late enhancement protocol revealed areas of myocarditis and infarction, and cardiac MRI and coronary angiography were then performed © RSNA, 2021,Background The elderly has a high risk of cardiovascular disease, which is often accompanied by platelet hyperactivity Tomato extracts can inhibit platelet activation and have beneficial health effects We aimed to investigate the effect of Fruitflow FF, a watersoluble tomato extract, on platelet function in elderly participantsMethods This randomized group study was conducted with people over 50 years old The participants were randomly divided into four groups placebo 150 mgday, FF 150 mgday, acetylsalicylic acid ASA 100 mgday, and FF 150 mgday  ASA 100 mgday These groups received the respective supplements after dinner daily for 7 days Fasting blood was collected from the participants on days 0 and 8 to analyze platelet aggregation and the content of thromboxane B2 TXB2, 6ketoprostaglandin F1α, and platelet factor 4 PF4 xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0Results One hundred ninety elderly participants were recruited and completed this clinical trial The results showed that the FF intervention for 7 days decreased platelet aggregation by 77 in adenosine diphosphatestimulated platelets, which was similar to the effect of ASA, which decreased platelet aggregation by 94 FF reduced platelet aggregation by 102 in collagenstimulated platelets, and ASA reduced platelet aggregation by 383 in collagenactivated platelets This suggests that ASA exerts a stronger inhibitory effect than FF on collagenstimulated platelet aggregation The combination of FF  ASA did not exert a synergistic inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation Treatment with FF significantly decreased plasma TXB2, 6ketoPGF1α, and PF4 levels, and its effects were similar to ASA Conclusion Fruitflow suppressed platelet aggregation and decreased TXB2, 6ketoPGF1α, and PF4 levels in elderly participants These findings indicate that FF might reduce the risk of thrombosis in cardiovascular diseasesTrial registration code ChiCTR2000034647 at wwwclinicaltrialsgov,The mortality of COVID19 patients is increasing in logarithmic fashion and is mostly observed in older age people and patients having history of chronic ailments like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular  cerebrovascular dysfunction, compromised immunity, renal comorbidities, hepatic, obesity problems etc, and recently investigated thrombotic complications The molecular underpinnings linking the chronic human diseases with COVID19 related morbidity and mortality are evolving and poorly understood The aim of the present review is to discuss the mortality and morbidity in COVID19 in relation to preexisting comorbidities across the globe, upcoming molecular mechanisms associated with expression profile of ACE2 and viral load, evolving pathophysiology of COVID19 with special reference to thrombotic complication Storm of Blood Clots and related predictive markers The levels of plasminogenplasmin in comorbid diseases of COVID19 have been elaborated in the framework of risk and benefits of fibrinolysis in COVID19 We have also attempted to discuss the puzzle of prescribing ARBs and ACEI drugs in COVID19 management which are routinely prescribed for the management of hypertension in COVID19 patients A focused discourse on risk of cardiovascular complications and diabetes in concert with COVID19 pathogenesis has been presented along with dynamics of SARSCoV2 induced immune dysfunctions in COVID19 patients,The emergence of Coronavirus Disease 19 COVID19 as a pandemic has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives worldwide since its initial breakout With increasing reports from clinical observations and autopsy findings, it became clear that the disease causes acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS, as well as a broad spectrum of systemic and multiorgan pathologies, including angiopathy, endothelialitis, and thrombosis Coagulopathy is associated with the activity of megakaryocytes, which play crucial roles in modulating the platelet homeostasis Only a few autopsy reports include findings on thrombosis formation and the presence of megakaryocytes Here we review and summarize the possible involvement and the pathophysiology of the thromboembolic events in COVID19 patients based on postmortem reports We reviewed postmortem reports from March 2020 to September 2020 Eleven autopsy reports that demonstrated thromboembolic involvement findings, either macroscopically or microscopically, were included in this review All studies reported similar pulmonary gross findings Not all studies described thrombi formation and megakaryocyte findings Pulmonary embolism, coagulopathy, severe endothelial injury, and widespread thrombosis are frequent in COVID19 patients, following many patients with highlevel DDimer, increased fibrinogen, abnormal prothrombic coagulation, and thrombocytopenia Reports showed that thrombus was also found in the lower extremities deep veins and the prostatic venous plexus In conclusion, a complex interaction of SARSCoV2 virus invasion with platelets, leukocytes, endothelial cells, inflammation, immune response, and the possible involvement of megakaryocytes may increase the cumulative risk of thrombosis by a yet unclear cellular and humoral interaction,Awareness of the management of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 and airway diseases can effectively help clinical physician during the coronavirus pandemic Herein, we elucidated a COVID19 case coexisting with severe asthma Budesonideglycopyrrolateformoterol fumarate BGF was used as sequential medicine to systemic glucocorticoids for his persisted symptoms related to bronchospasms Our case suggests patients with longterm airway diseases like asthma probably attribute their symptoms to COVID19 instead of primary diseases, which make it more difficult in the symptom control BGF is able to be an effective and convenient choice as sequential medicine to systemic glucocorticoids in some refractory asthmatic patients complicated with COVID19,Background To summarise the ultrasound manifestations of coronavirus disease19 COVID19 patients with lung lesions and explore the clinical value of bedside ultrasound in the identification of patients at risk of progression to severe disease Methods This retrospective study enrolled 31 patients with COVID19 who were admitted to our hospital from January 18 to February 5, 2020 Lung ultrasounds were performed in all cases to evaluate the ultrasound manifestations of the patients lung lesions and to determine the lung ultrasound scores LUS The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for the multifactor analysis of 7 candidate parameters, including the LUS and the oxygenation index PaO2FiO2 Receiver operating characteristic ROC curve analysis was performed to evaluate the predictive value of the LUS Results Lung ultrasound images of COVID19 patients mainly reflected the presence of interstitial pulmonary lesions 903, 2831 The lung lesions were primarily distributed in the subpleural and peripheral pulmonary zones Multivariate analyses identified the oxygenation index, the LUS, and the lymphocyte count as factors related to the progression to severecritical disease in COVID19 patients P005 With a cutoff value of 95, the area under the ROC curve was 0910 The LUS showed a sensitivity and specificity of 813 and 930, respectively P0001, with an overall accuracy of 75 Conclusions The lung ultrasound findings in COVID19 patients were mainly and specifically manifested as interstitial lesions involving the peripheral zones of the lung In addition, ultrasound imaging could predict the likelihood of COVID19 patients progressing to severe disease, thereby allowing for early intervention Thus, lung ultrasounds have great clinical value in monitoring and evaluating COVID19 patients,,,,BACKGROUND New evidence from retrospective cohort studies on risk of death from COVID19 infection became available We aimed to systematically review the clinical risk factors for fatal outcome of COVID19 METHODS We performed metaanalysis, using PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases from December 1 2019 to June 10 2020 The metaanalysis summarized clinical, laboratory, radiological features, and complications of nonsurvivors with confirmed COVID19 In addition, a fixed or randomeffects model was adopted based on the heterogeneity among studies We also used funnelplot with Eggers tests to screen potential publication bias RESULTS In total, twenty studies with 15,408 COVID19 cases were included in our metaanalysis Male, current smoking, and older age were associated with inhospital death Patients aged 60 years or over had the highest pooled ORs OR 494 289, 844 Nonsurvivors were more likely to have diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease CVD, respiratory disease, or chronic kidney disease CKD Respiratory disease had the highest pooled ORs OR 255 214, 305 Dyspnea OR 331 178, 616 I2  83 and fatigue OR 136 107, 173 I2  0 were associated with increased risk of death Increased white blood cell count, decreased lymphocyte and platelet counts, were also associated with increased risk of death Biomarkers of coagulation function, inflammation, liver and kidney function, cardiac and muscle injury were also elevated in nonsurvivors CONCLUSIONS Male, current smoking patients aged 60 years or over might face a greater risk of inhospital death and the comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, CVD, respiratory disease, and CKD could also influence the prognosis of the COVID19 Clinical feature such as dyspnea and fatigue could imply the exacerbation and even death Our findings highlighted early markers of mortality which were beneficial to identify fatal COVID19,BACKGROUND To retrospectively analyze the pulmonary computed tomography CT characteristics and dynamic changes in the lungs of cured coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 patients at discharge and reexamination METHODS A total of 155 cured COVID19 patients admitted to designated hospitals in Yunnan Province, China, from February 1, 2020, to March 20, 2020, were included All patients underwent pulmonary CT at discharge and at 2 weeks after discharge during reexamination at hospital A retrospective analysis was performed using these two pulmonary CT scans of the cured patients to observe changes in the number, distribution, morphology, and density of lesions RESULTS At discharge, the lung CT images of 15 cured patients showed no obvious lesions, while those of the remaining 140 patients showed different degrees of residual lesions Patients with moderate disease mostly had multiple pulmonary lesions, mainly in the lower lobes of both lungs At reexamination, the lung lesions in the patients with moderate disease had significantly improved P005, and the lung lesions in the patients with severe disease had partially improved, especially in patients with multilobe involvement χ 2 3956, P005 At reexamination, the lung lesions of patients with severe disease did not show significant changes P005 CONCLUSIONS The pulmonary CT manifestations of cured COVID19 patients had certain characteristics and variation patterns, providing a reference for the clinical evaluation of treatment efficacy and prognosis of patients,BACKGROUND The coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is an emerging pandemic of global public health concern We aimed to summarize the characteristics of COVID19 patients in the early stage of the pandemic and explore the risk factors of disease progression METHODS We conducted a systematic review with metaanalysis, searching three databases for studies published between January 1, 2020, and March 18, 2020 We used randomeffects models to calculate the 95 confidence intervals of pooled estimated prevalence and the odds ratio between the severe and nonsevere cases RESULTS Ninety studies involving 16,526 COVID19 patients were included Hypertension 191 and diabetes 95 were the most common comorbidities The most prevalent clinical symptoms were fever 784, cough 585, and fatigue 264 Increased serum ferritin 742, high Creactive protein 733, and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate ESR 722 were the most frequently reported laboratory abnormalities Most patients had bilateral lung involvement 822 and showed peripheral 669 and subpleural 621 distribution, with multifocal involvement 731 And the most common CT features were vascular enlargement 643, groundglass opacity GGO 607, and thickened interlobular septa 551 Respiratory failure was the most common complication 307 and the overall casefatality rate CFR was 42 Moreover, male, history of smoking, and comorbidities might influence the prognosis Most clinical symptoms such as fever, high fever, cough, sputum production, fatigue, shortness of breath, dyspnoea, and abdominal pain were linked to the severity of disease Some specific laboratory indicators implied the deterioration of disease, such as leucocytosis, lymphopenia, platelet, alanine aminotransferase ALT, aspartate aminotransferase AST, albumin, creatinine, creatine kinase CK, lactic dehydrogenase LDH, Creactive protein, procalcitonin PCT, and Ddimer Besides, the risk of bilateral pneumonia, consolidation, pleural effusion, and enlarged mediastinal nodes was higher in severe cases CONCLUSIONS Most COVID19 patients have fever and cough with lymphopenia and increased inflammatory indices, and the main CT feature is GGO involved bilateral lung Patients with comorbidities and worse clinical symptoms, laboratory characteristics, and CT findings tend to have poor disease progression,,,,Organizing pneumonia OP is a subacute process of pulmonary tissue repair secondary to lung injury, defined histopathologically by intraalveolar buds of granulation tissue within the lumen of distal pulmonary airspaces It can be either cryptogenic or secondary SOP to different clinical conditions, namely infections Despite being nonspecific, its diagnosis can be made by the association of clinical and imaging criteria We report two cases of OP associated to SARSCoV2 pneumonia, admitted at a Portuguese tertiary hospital unit dedicated to COVID19 Both patients presented with severe respiratory failure with need of invasive mechanical ventilation After initial recovery, there was worsening of dyspnea and hypoxemic respiratory failure with increase in inflammatory markers Chest CT revealed an OP pattern Other conditions such as superinfection, autoimmune disease and iatrogenic etiology, were excluded and corticotherapy at a dose of 1 mgkgday was administered Chest CT follow up of both our patients showed complete resolution of OP pattern, with mild to moderate residual pulmonary fibrosis without honeycombing There is no OP to SARSCoV2 case series yet published describing the progress of patients after corticotherapy, although the association between systemic corticosteroids and lower allcause mortality in patients with COVID19 has been recently established It is possible that, as has been described with other viruses, OP secondary to SARSCoV2 represents an immunological process after initial infection, presenting with elevation of inflammatory markers and cytokines storm in the bloodstream and lung tissue, which may explain the favorable response to corticosteroids,,,Thyroid hormones have integral role on cardiac homeostasis, and hypothyroidism may be associated with impaired myocardial contractility, altered endothelial function, and blunted response to catecholamines We describe a patient with undiagnosed severe hypothyroidism who developed an acute myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest during sedation for bronchoscopy He required a prolonged resuscitation, which included coronary catheterization and placement of intraaortic balloon pump The resuscitation was noteworthy for blunted physiologic responses to large doses of epinephrine, in particular persistent bradycardia without evidence of conduction abnormalities On admission to the intensive care unit, he was hypothermic 314⁰C, bradycardic, and hypotensive Laboratory investigations revealed profound hypothyroidism, and thyroid hormone replacement was initiated Within hours of initiation of thyroid hormone replacement, the need for vasopressor support was reduced He had a complete recovery and was discharged home neurologically intact We believe that this favourable neurologic outcome could be attributed to efficient resuscitation, prompt coronary revascularization, but also profound hypothermia likely related to a hypothyroidismassociated hypometabolic state,,In the United States, nonobstructive coronary disease has been on the rise and each year nearly one million adults suffer myocardial infarction, 70 of which are nonSTsegment elevation myocardial infarction NSTEMI In addition, approximately 15 of patients suffering NSTEMI will have subsequent readmission for a recurrent acute coronary syndrome ACS While invasive angiography remains the standard of care in the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to these patients, these methods have limitations that include procedural complications, uncertain specificity in diagnosis of the culprit lesion in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease CAD, and challenges in following coronary disease over time The role of coronary computed tomography angiography CCTA for evaluating patients with both stable and acute chest pain has seen a paramount upshift in the last decade This paper reviews the established role of CCTA for the rapid exclusion of obstructive plaque in troponin negative acute chest pain, while exploring opportunities to address challenges in the current approach to evaluating NSTEMI,Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation HCT is a curative treatment option for patients with hematologic conditions but presents many complications that must be managed as a complex, chronic condition Mobile health applications mHealth apps may permit tracking of symptoms in HCT In seeking strategies to manage the complexities of HCT, our team collaborated with Sicklesoft, Inc, to develop an mHealth app specifically for HCT patients to allow for daily evaluation of patient health, Technology Recordings to better Understand Bone Marrow Transplantation TRUBMT The primary value of this application is that of potentially enhancing the monitoring of symptoms and general health of patients undergoing HCT, with the ultimate goal of allowing earlier detection of adverse events, earlier intervention, and improving outcomes To first evaluate patient interest in mHealth apps, we designed and administered an interest survey to patients at the 2017 BMTInfoNet reunion As a followup to the positive feedback received, we began testing the TRUBMT app in a Phase 1 pilot study Thirty patients were enrolled in this singlearm study and were given the TRUBMT mHealth app on a smartphone device in addition to a wearable activity tracker Patients were followed for up to 180 days, all the while receiving daily app monitoring Adherence to TRUBMT was approximately 30 daily and 44 weekly, and greater adherence was associated with increased meal completion, decreased heart rate, and shorter hospital stay TRUBMT assessments of symptom severity were significantly associated with duration of hospital stay and development of chronic graftversushost disease Our findings suggest that using TRUBMT throughout HCT is feasible for patients and established a proofofconcept for a future randomized control trial of the TRUBMT application in HCT © 2021 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation Published by Elsevier Inc All rights reserved,Background There are little data on the use of virtual care for patients with arrhythmia We evaluated a virtual clinic platform, in conjunction with specialist care, for patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation AF Methods This was a prospective, observational cohort study evaluating an online educational and treatment platform, with a randomized substudy examining the use of an ambulatory singlelead electrocardiogram heart monitor AHM Followup was 6 months The main outcome was patients platform use success was defined as 90 of patients using the platform at least once, and 75 using it at least twice The primary outcome in the AHM substudy was Atrial Fibrillation Symptom Severity AFSS score Other outcomes included patient satisfaction questionnaires, quality of life, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations for AF Results We enrolled 94 patients between July 2018 and May 2019 83 of patients logged in at least once and 543 more than once Patients who were older, were male, or had newonset AF were more likely to log in to the platform Satisfaction scores were high 7094 of patients responded favorably Qualityoflife scores improved at 3 and 6 months In the AHM substudy n  71, those who received an AHM had lower AFSS scores least square mean difference 252, 95 CI 448 to 025, P  03 There was no difference in emergency department visits or hospitalizations Conclusion The online platform did not reach our feasibility target but was well received Allocation of an AHM was associated with improved quality of life Virtual AF care shows promise and should be evaluated in further research,The differential diagnosis for mural thickening of the gallbladder is broad and includes many extracholecystic conditions, especially in pediatrics Primary cholecystitis is a rare cause of right upper quadrant pain in children 10 years of age presenting to the emergency department Here we present the case of a child transferred to a pediatric emergency department due to concern for cholecystitis, radiographically diagnosed with gallbladder wall thickening as the presenting sign of infectious endocarditis with progressive left ventricular failure Learning Objective Mural thickening of the gallbladder in the pediatric patient should prompt clinicians to think broadly about its etiology spanning several organ systems, including cardiac disease,Background Ultrasound utilization during access enables precise vessel cannulation We sought to evaluate the outcomes of ultrasound guided dorsal distal radial artery DDRA, radial, and ulnar cardiac catheterization CC and percutaneous coronary intervention PCI Methods We performed a prospective observational study of 224 patients 5812 years at an academic medical center from October 2016 to March 2020 median followup of 13 months and compared the outcomes of ultrasound guided DDRA, ulnar, or radial artery CC and PCI Groups were divided into DDRA n18, 80, ulnar n94, 420 and radial access n112, 500 Primary endpoints included the number of access attempts and conversion to femoral access Secondary endpoints included allcause mortality, cardiac mortality, acute myocardial infarction AMI, stroke, repeat revascularization, stent thrombosis, instent restenosis, and access site complications Results In the primary endpoints, no significant difference was found amongst groups in the number of access attempts p0272 or conversion to femoral access p0381 In the radial group 5911 years, median followup of 16 months, 2 cardiac mortalities 1 lymphocytic myocarditis, 1 AMI and 2 noncardiac mortalities occurred None of the secondary endpoints occurred in the DDRA 6617 years, median followup of 13 months or ulnar group 5611 years, median followup of 14 months Conclusion DDRA and ulnar PCI was safe and efficacious with no complications Femoral conversion or the number of access attempts was not different between DDRA, ulnar, or radial Therefore, DDRA and ulnarxa0are viable alternatives for PCI, which can preserve radial for future use,Transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement in the dysfunctional native right ventricular outflow tract RVOT provides an ongoing challenge Currently available transcatheter pulmonary valves were developed for implantation within surgically placed conduits and bioprosthetic valves, and are often inadequately sized for the dilated native RVOT The Medtronic Harmony™ Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, the Alterra Adaptive Prestent™ Edwards Life Sciences, Irvine, CA, and the Venus Pvalve™ Venus Medtech, Shanghai, China are three devices that have been developed in recent years, for the dedicated indication of transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement in the dysfunctional native RVOT In this article, we describe each of these devices, and review the clinical experience with them to date,This collaborative statement from the International Society for Holter and Noninvasive ElectrocardiologyHeart Rhythm SocietyEuropean Heart Rhythm AssociationAsia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society describes the current status of mobile health mHealth technologies in arrhythmia management The range of digital medical tools and heart rhythm disorders that they may be applied to and clinical decisions that may be enabled are discussed The facilitation of comorbidity and lifestyle management increasingly recognized to play a role in heart rhythm disorders and patient selfmanagement are novel aspects of mHealth The promises of predictive analytics but also operational challenges in embedding mHealth into routine clinical care are explored,Background Assessment of the heartrate corrected QTinterval on the 12lead electrocardiogram ECG when prescribing medications known to increase the risk of Torsades de Pointes TdP has become a common part of consultationliaison psychiatry practice Objectives Highlighted by a patient who experienced psychiatric decompensation due to inaccurate interpretation of QTc prolongation in the setting of a wide QRS complex, we aimed to describe the current literature on the approach to assessment of prolonged repolarization in patients with ventricular conduction delay VCD due to bundle branch block BBB and ventricular pacing VP Results Physicians of any specialty may perform initial ECG interpretation and should be proficient in the definition, recognition, and understanding of the basic pathophysiology of electrocardiographic abnormalities We discuss current approaches to assessment of the QTinterval in patients with a wide QRS complex due to BBB and VP, including bivariate QTc modification, univariate QTinterval modifications, and use of the JTinterval Conclusions The QTinterval is prolonged ipso facto in patients with a wide QRS complex from VCDVP and must be adjusted for QRS duration Multiple formulae have been proposed to account for wide QRS complex in this setting with no single universally accepted methodology We suggest the use of either the Bogossian formula or JTinterval followed by Hodges or Framingham heartrate correction to adjust for a wide QRS complex It is critical that the CL psychiatrist be able to identify a wide QRS complex on the ECG, understand implications for accurate assessment of prolonged depolarization, and apply an appropriate correction methodology,Adrenal incidentalomas AI may be associated with a mild autonomous cortisol secretion MACS in up to one third of cases There is growing evidence that MACS patients actually present increased risk of cardiovascular disease and higher mortality rate, driven by increased prevalence of known cardiovascular risk factors, as well as accelerated cardiovascular remodelling Adrenalectomy seems to have cardiometabolic beneficial effects in MACS patients but their management is still a debated topic due to the lack of highquality studies Several studies suggested that so called nonfunctioning AI may be actually functioning with an associated increased cardiovascular risk Although the individual cortisol sensitivity and peripheral activation have been recently suggested to play a role in influencing the cardiovascular risk even in apparently eucortisolemic patients, to date the degree of cortisol secretion, as mirrored by the cortisol levels after dexamethasone suppression test remains the best predictor of an increased cardiovascular risk in AI patients However, whether or not the currently used cutoff set at 50 nmolL for cortisol levels after dexamethasone suppression could be considered completely reliable in ruling out hypercortisolism remains unclear,In this paper, we described 2 cases with COVID19 pneumonia, who developed pulmonary emphysema, bullae, and pneumothorax during therapy In a 48yearold man with mechanical ventilation, parts of ground glass opacities and consolidations transformed into emphysema and giant bulla, and bilateral pneumothorax were also observed In a 35yearold man, localized emphysema and pulmonary bullae were seen in subpleural area in bilateral upper lobes, where no previous lesions were presented In conclusion, pulmonary emphysema, bullae, and pneumothorax could be complications of COVID19 On one hand, surgical emphysema in ventilated COVID19 patients was observed as in SARS patients On the other hand, more serious destruction of lung parenchyma was found in COVID19 patients,We report two cases of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 in patients who developed pulmonary embolism and transient antiphospholipid antibodies At the time of presentation with acute pulmonary embolism, both patients had leukocytosis and increased levels of anticardiolipin antibodies, which resolved at testing 12 weeks after initial presentation Studying cases of pulmonary embolism and increased antiphospholipid antibodies in the context of COVID19 could be one of the factors for elucidating the possible connection between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, antiphospholipid antibodies, and thrombosis,Since the widespread of acute respiratory syndrome infection caused by Coronavirus19, chest computed tomography CT was considered a useful imaging tool commonly used in early diagnosis and monitoring of patients with complicated Covid19 pneumonia Many typical imaging features of this disease were carefully described with chest CT, as well as the collateral CT findings in the lungs and mediastinum Here we describe the case of a patient with Covid19 pneumonia, that collaterally had a pulmonary hamartoma in the left lung, documented at CT,Advances in congenital heart disease CHD have changed radically the prognosis and burden of the disease The vast majority of patients survive into adulthood and their profile in terms of comorbidities has changed Organisation of tertiary and nontertiary care, collaboration at national and international level, randomised controlled trials and implementation of novelties, such as research based biobanking, ehealth and artificial intelligence should all be employed to meet their healthcare needs,,Background The indeterminate pulmonary nodule is a common clinical problem Preoperative tissue diagnosis is not always possible, despite all attempts The objectives of this study were to determine the frequency of a malignant diagnosis in this scenario and whether attempted preoperative biopsy impacted estimation of the risk of malignancy Patients and Methods We reviewed 500 consecutive cases of pulmonary resection without a preoperative tissue diagnosis at a tertiary care center from 2009 to 2013 Age, sex, smoking status, prior malignancy, tumour size and whether tissue diagnosis was attempted were recorded Logistic regression models were constructed to determine factors associated with a malignant diagnosis Results There were 297 594 males, the mean age was 649 years, and 412 824 had a smoking history 203 406 patients had a malignancy history 36 72 had previous lung cancer Biopsy was attempted for 102 205 patients The final diagnosis was lung cancer in 336 patients 672, metastatic in 93 186 and benign in 71 142 Male sex, increasing age, smoking history, and prior lung cancer were positive predictors of lung cancer Model discrimination was good cstatistic 083 Attempted biopsy did not alter model discrimination Conclusions In this cohort 86 of resected lesions were malignant Decision to pursue preoperative tissue diagnosis did not change the predictive ability offered by clinical factors These findings are reassuring in the scenario when a patient is operable but the diagnosis remains unknown Micro Abstract Lung nodules that are not amenable to biopsy are a common clinical dilemma In a cohort of 500 operable patients, we assessed the association of clinical factors on final pathology and whether attempted biopsy, representing diagnostic uncertainty, affected this association 86 of cases were malignant, clinical characteristics provided good predictive ability, and attempted biopsy did not alter model discrimination,Planning for the First International Pediatric CardioOncology Meeting has been underway since early 2019, with the original date in October 2020 delayed due to the COVID19 pandemic But patients continue to need care, research carries on, and the ability to learn from our colleagues remains one of the most important tools in our collective ability to advance the field Through collaboration with Heart University wwwheartuniversityorg, a free webbased global education resource and training tool with an emphasis on acquired and congenital heart disease, we are able to provide colleagues around the world with focused sessions similar to those that will be expanded at the inperson meeting The first such twohour webinar was presented live online on December 16, 2020, and moving forward similar webinars will be offered approximately every other month for the next year leading up to the inperson meeting in 2022, with all sessions available online afterward for ondemand viewing Although we are excited to get together with our colleagues in person, why wait until then to share what we know The future is now,,Pulmonary rehabilitation PR is a cornerstone management for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD International respiratory societies defined PR is more than just an exercise program it is a comprehensive care delivered by a team of dedicated healthcare professionals with a strong emphasis on longterm healthenhancing Behaviors However, Uncertainty exists with varied reasons for the political and geographical barriers of referral, uptake, attendance, and completion of PR in both primary and secondary care Besides, COVID19 pandemic has sparked many global controversies and challenges on pulmonary rehabilitation service delivery PostCOVID19 guidelines emphasize on integrated care rehabilitation for patients with COPD Thus, this concise review intends to understand the gaps in United Kingdom healthcare policies, practices, and PR services resources To date, there is no clear consensus on PR integrated care model pathway to address the unmet needs, measure the health and social care disparities adds to the disease burden of COPD Based on the culmination of evidence, this perspective offers a theoretical framework of PR integrated service model, a pathway to deliver highvalue personalized care to patients with COPD,,Background Digital health is transforming healthcare delivery Objective To compare the current digital health landscape in select groups of cardiac electrophysiology EP professionals prior to and during the COVID19 era Methods Two online surveys were emailed to 4 Heart Rhythm Society communities and tweeted out to Twitter EP, 1 before and 1 during the pandemic Categorical variables were analyzed using the χ 2 test and reported as absolute numbers and percentages Results There were 253 prepandemic S1 and 273 followup surveys S2 completed The majority of respondents to both surveys were male, aged 55 years 706 vs 751, universityaffiliated 526 vs 55, and physicians 833 vs 879 Between S1 and S2, routine use of videotelehealth increased 59 vs 586 P  001 for all types of consultations P  001 for all Wireless electrocardiogram prescribing was prevalent and similar 802 vs 810, whereas wireless blood pressure monitoring 99 vs 183 and wireless oximetry 16 vs 81 P  006 for both prescribing both increased For smartphone mobile applications mApps, prescriptions for heart rate mApps decreased 506 vs 407 P  022, while vital sign 289 vs 37 P  04 and symptom trackers 158 vs 249 P  01 prescribing increased A majority in both surveys 846 vs 755 reported no workplace infrastructure or support for digital health with concerns for lack of parity in reimbursement Conclusion Our results show an increase in adoption of digital health by EP during the COVID19 pandemic Concerns regarding a lack of supportive infrastructure persisted Development of professional society guidelines on optimal clinical workflow, infrastructure, and reimbursement may help advance and sustain digital health integration in EP,,The purpose of this article is to inform nurse practitioners and other healthcare professionals regarding the utilization of CardioMEMs, a wireless pulmonary artery pressure monitoring device, in reducing heart failurerelated hospital readmission rates This article will briefly explain how CardioMEMs also helps to reduce the risk of Covid19 in patients with heart failure,,Over one million children are born with congenital heart defects each year, whereas four million children live with with rheumatic heart disease Although a majority of these patients will eventually require surgical or interventional care, most live in areas without access to safe, timely, and affordable cardiac surgical care Countries with limited or no local cardiac surgical care spend up to over 10 of their health budgets on sending patients abroad to receive cardiac care Similarly, billions of dollars are spent each year on international medical tourism, notably including seeking cardiac surgical care abroad Some low and middleincome countries have successfully invested in domestic cardiac surgical services, saving tens of millions of dollars over time whilst strengthening local health systems In this article, we describe international medical tourism for pediatric and congenital heart disease, and present an analysis on whether expenditure in seeking foreign care for cardiovascular patients is worth the cost in light of a neglect of investments in local cardiac services in countries with growing health systems,,,The symptom of breathlessness is well recognized as part of the presentation of a wide range of medical conditions It can be a manifestation of a lifethreatening emergency In acute medical settings, the priority is to quickly recognize patients who are critically unwell and require emergency treatment For these patients, rapid initial assessment and immediate treatment are essential However, once symptoms have stabilized or in less acute settings, a more thorough assessment is required Cough is a common respiratory symptom, often part of a symptom complex, which is troublesome for the patient It is important to recognize worrying associated features to prompt further investigation In late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 infection emerged from a zoonotic source, resulting in many cases of infection, hospitalizations and deaths, and has since spread in a pandemic across every continent A substantial percentage of patients with COVID19 develop an acute respiratory illness requiring hospital care Cough and acute breathlessness are two of the most prevalent symptoms in this infection any patient presenting to an acute setting should currently be assumed to have this infection and immediately tested with a viral swab from the upper airway to guide management,Haemostasis involves an explosive reaction designed to curtail blood loss, restore vascular integrity, provide a barrier to infection and preserve life Haemostatic balance is maintained through four key components vascular endothelium, platelets, the coagulation pathway and fibrinolysis Any imbalance in this tightly regulated process can result in thrombotic or haemorrhagic conditions with associated morbidity and mortality Fatalities amidst the SARSCoV2 global pandemic from COVID19 epitomize this imbalance when the body is overwhelmed by clot burden from immunedriven thrombus formation,,,,We report an interesting case of a 38yearold woman presenting with reverse Takotsubo syndrome TTS secondary to an Addisonian crisis, her second such episode A few years prior, she had presented with typical TTS in the setting of Addisonian crisis diagnostic workup revealing AutoImmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type II APS II We believe this to be the first case report of typical and variant phenotypes of TTS in a patient with APS II The pathogenic link between these two conditions is explored In patients presenting with Addisonian crises and refractory shock, the possibility of concurrent TTS should be considered TTS muddies the diagnostic waters and poses therapeutic challenges as outlined,BackgroundWhile hypertension is the most common comorbid condition in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 in Korea, there is a lack of studies investigating risk factors in COVID19 patients with hypertension in Korea In this study, we aimed to examine the effects risk factors in hypertensive Korean COVID19 patientsMethodsWe selected patients from the database of the project OpenData4Covid19 This information was linked to their 3year historical healthcare data The severity of the disease was classified into five levels We also clustered the levels into two gradesResultsThe risk factors associated with COVID19 severity were old age, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD, malignancy, and renal replacement therapy The use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors ACEIs or angiotensin receptor blockers ARBs both before and after a diagnosis of COVID19 were not associated with COVID19 severity A multivariate analysis revealed that old age, male sex, diabetes mellitus, and renal replacement therapy were risk factors for severe COVID19ConclusionThe results suggest that in hypertensive patients with COVID19, older age, male sex, a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, and renal replacement therapy were risk factors for a severe clinical course In addition, the use of ARBs and ACEIs before or after COVID19 infection did not affect a patients risk of contracting COVID19 nor did it contribute to a worse prognosis for the disease These results highlighted that precautions should be considered for hypertensive patients with those risk factors and do not support discontinuation of ARBs and ACEIs during COVID19 pandemic,BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 continues to impact populations around the globe Information regarding the incidences and implications of arrhythmias in COVID19 is limited METHODS A total of 463 patients with COVID19 and who had at least one electrocardiogram recording from February 1 to March 19, 2020, in Wuhan Union Hospital were enrolled in the study RESULTS Arrhythmias occurred in 85 of 463 184 patients atrial arrhythmias in 102, junctional arrhythmias in 02, ventricular arrhythmias in 35, and conduction block in 73 Compared with patients without arrhythmias, those with arrhythmias had higher mortality, both during the time from symptom onset p,At the time of this writing July 6, 2020, the mortality rate reported for COVID19 in Argentina wasxa02 Also, the countrys critical care beds are 63 occupied This achievement results fromxa0the excellent coordination and action by the Argentine Ministry of Health together with the 23 provinces and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires of the nation for now MATERIALS AND METHODS Regarding cardiovascular care for patients over 65 years of age, a more accurate analysis could be performed when two comparative halfyearly periods corresponding to the years 2019 and 2020 pandemic time were compared The data collected regarding this age range revealed issues that had not previously been evaluated in our country That undoubtedly proposes a different solution for the future based on a strict scientific analysis RESULTS The ratio of patients who received stents to those that underwent coronary surgery was 6 to 1, while the ratio of patients who had offpump surgery to those that underwent minimally invasive surgery was 69 to 1 CONCLUSION An Argentinian perspective regarding cardiovascular care is good because the country has an excellent level of qualified medical training in its cardiac surgery and interventional cardiology services, as well as healthcare infrastructure distributed throughout the country, which will undoubtedly be able to respond to the new challenges posed by the postpandemic period,ECG abnormalities associated with COVID‐19 pneumonia and adverse outcome are undefined and poorly described in prior studies To assess the predictive role of baseline ECG markers of increased risk of malignant arrhythmias and cardiac death for adverse in‐hospital outcomes A retrospective study included 93 patients of newly diagnosed COVID‐19 with features consistent with pneumonia who were admitted to the hospital from August 20 to September 20, 2020 The main outcomes were defined as receiving mechanical ventilation, in‐hospital cardiac arrest, length of ICU stay, and degree of lung damage according to computed tomography CT score Increased QTc QT corrected interval, Tp‐e T from peak to end interval, and transmural dispersion of repolarization TDR were independent predictors of prolonged ICU stay P  0001 after adjustment for baseline clinical characteristics Increasing age P  0001 followed by increased QTc interval P  02 and history of chronic lung disease P  04 were independent predictors of extensive lung damage The independent predictors for in‐hospital cardiac arrest were increased QTc P  02 followed by increasing age P  04 and increased Tp‐e interval P  04 Repolarization abnormalities on baseline ECG may be useful prognostic markers in patients with COVID‐19 pneumonia There is scant data as of yet that address the predictors of increased risk of adverse outcome of COVID‐19 pneumonia, particularly during acute phase of infection Baseline ECG repolarization abnormalities may be useful prognostic markers in patients with COVID‐19 pneumonia according to the results of this study,Abstract  To date, existing animal models of the acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS have failed to translate preclinical discoveries into effective pharmacotherapy or diagnostic biomarkers To address this translational gap, we developed a highfidelity swine model of ARDS utilizing clinicallyrelevant lung injury exposures Fourteen male swine were anesthetized, mechanically ventilated, and surgically instrumented for hemodynamic monitoring, blood, and tissue sampling Animals were allocated to one of three groups 1 Indirect lung injury only  animals were inoculated by direct injection of E coli into the kidney parenchyma, provoking systemic inflammation and distributive shock physiology 2 Direct lung injury only  animals received volutrauma, hyperoxia, and bronchoscopedelivered gastric particles 3 Combined indirect and direct lung injury animals were administered both abovedescribed indirect and direct lung injury exposures Animals were monitored for up to 12 hours, with serial collection of physiologic data, blood samples, and radiographic imaging Lung tissue was acquired postmortem for pathological examination In contrast to indirect lung injury only and direct lung injury only groups, animals in the combined indirect and direct lung injury group exhibited all of the physiological, radiographic, and histopathologic hallmarks of human ARDS impaired gas exchange mean PaO 2 FiO 2 ratio 1248  638, diffuse bilateral opacities on chest radiographs, and extensive pathologic evidence of diffuse alveolar damage Our novel porcine model of ARDS, built on clinicallyrelevant lung injury exposures, faithfully recapitulates the physiologic, radiographic, and histopathologic features of human ARDS, and fills a crucial gap in the translational study of human lung injury,INTRODUCTION The diagnosis of patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 suspicion but negative reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction RTPCR test is challenging OBJECTIVE We aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of chest computed tomography CT in RTPCRnegative patients with suspected COVID19 MATERIALS AND METHODS The study included patients who were admitted to our hospital with the suspicion of COVID19 between 1 April 2020 and 30 April 2020 and tested negative after RTPCR test, and underwent CT for further diagnosis Initial CT findings were classified as typical, indeterminate, and atypical for COVID19, and negative for pneumonia Incidental findings on CT were noted RESULTS Of the 338 patients with a mean age of 57xa0years min 18xa0yearsmax 96xa0years, 168 4970 were male and 170 5029 were female The most common symptoms were cough 5887, fever 4082, and dyspnea 3934 The CT findings were typical for COVID19 in 109 3224 patients, indeterminate in 47 1390 patients, and atypical in 77 2278 patients The CT findings of 105 3106 patients were negative for pneumonia Incidental lung nodules suspicious of malignancy were identified in seven patients Seventyseven patients 2278 had extrapulmonary incidental findings CONCLUSION The diagnostic value of CT in RTPCRnegative patients with suspected COVID19 is not very high Based on clinical, laboratory, and chest xray findings, it may be more appropriate to refer patients to CT after the first triage, when necessary,BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 emerged as a pandemic toward the end of 2019, causing large numbers of people to become infected and die OBJECTIVE To determine whether allergic diseases are a risk factor for hospitalization in COVID19 METHODS We conducted a study including 107 pediatric patients after COVID19 recovery The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood Phase 3 questionnaires were distributed together with a detailed history of environmental factors and an allergic evaluation including skin prick tests, specific immunoglobulin E tests, and spirometry We investigated the prevalence of allergic diseases and evaluated the factors associated with hospitalization in COVID19 RESULTS A total of 61 57 patients were hospitalized and 46 43 patients were followed closely in the outpatient clinic The prevalences of allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and episodic wheezing were 103, 6,5, 47, and 37, respectively, within the whole study population Although having asthma with or without allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and passive tobacco exposure were not found to be related to hospitalization because of COVID19, having a pet at home was found to decrease the risk of hospitalization odds ratio, 0191 95 confidence interval, 00470779 Pxa0 02 Spirometry tests revealed a higher forced expiratory volume in one second to forced vital capacity ratio and a peak expiratory flow reversibility in hospitalized patients than in nonhospitalized ones Pxa0 02 and Pxa0 003, respectively CONCLUSION Asthma and allergic diseases do not seem to be risk factors for hospitalization in children because of COVID19, and having a pet at home can be a protective effect Pulmonary function testing seems to be important for monitoring lung damage after COVID19,On January 2020, WHO confirmed the epidemic outbreak of SARSCoV2 as a Health Emergency of International Concern The aim of this metametaanalysis is quantifying metaanalytic findings on the association of cardiovascular disease CVD comorbidities and COVID19 severity Findings suggest that chances of getting severe COVID19 disease in patients with CVD is greater than those without CVD Also, prevalence of CVD in patents with COVID19 is 008 95 CIxa0xa0007008 The OR as 344 indicates that the odds of getting severe COVID19 is more than 3 times higher in those with CVD Also, prevalence of hypertension in patient with COVID19 is 027 95CIxa0xa0027028 and the OR as 268 indicates that the odds of getting severe COVID19 in cases with high blood pressure is more than 25 times higher than those without hypertension It is rational to suppose that persons with coronary artery disease are prone to severe viral infection thereby, guidelinedirected diagnosis and medical therapy is vital in CVD patients,Introduction The fight against COVID19 poses questions as to the clinical presentation, course, diagnosis, and treatment of the condition This case study presents a patient infected with COVID19 and suggests with additional research, that bedside ultrasound may be used to diagnose severity of disease and potentially, prognosticate functional lung recovery without using unnecessary resources and exposing additional healthcare professionals to infection Case Report A 46yearold male presented to the emergency department ED with cough, fever, and shortness of breath Chest Xray showed patchy airspace opacities bilaterally Rapid testing resulted positive for SARSCoV2 Bedside ultrasound showed abnormal lung parenchyma, with diffuse comet tail artifacts, consistent with interstitial pulmonary edema Following a prolonged intubation, patients abnormal lung ultrasound findings are resolved,,BackgroundAt peak COVID19 lockdown, patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation AF were faced with an equipoise between a palliative ratecontrol versus cautious rhythmcontrol strategy, including hospitalization for initiation of antiarrhythmic drugs AADs and cardiac procedures which was impossible due to hospitalization restrictionsObjectivesWe aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of outpatient initiation of dofetilide in patients with AF using cardiac implantable electronic devices CIEDs for rhythm and QTc interval monitoringMethodsAdult patients with symptomatic AF with prior failure or intolerance to other AADs were enrolled if they were willing to inoffice insertion of implantable loop recorders or already implanted with pacemakers or defibrillators capable of remote monitoring Exclusion criteria were known medical contraindications of dofetilide and unable to provide consent After making a shared management decision, dofetilide was initiated in a physician office, and rhythm and QTc intervals were monitored by ECGs and CIEDs Patients were followed to assess the efficacy and safety of the treatmentResultsThe study cohort comprised of 30 patients, age 76  7 years mean  standard deviation, 10 female 33, CHA2DS2VASc score 325  13, ejection fraction 6345  852, and QTc interval 43168  4509 ms From 22 73 patients in AF at presentation, SR was restored in 14 64 patients after 4 doses of dofetilide At 46  59 days of followup, maintenance of SR in total 22 73 patients without cardiac adverse effects was accomplishedConclusionEffective and safe outpatient initiation of dofetilide during the extenuating circumstance of COVID19 lockdown was possible in patients with AF who had CIEDs,,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2, a pandemic that began in China, was first noted in December 2019 AuQ Edit OK SARSCoV2 infects through the angiotensin‐converting enzyme2 ACE2 receptor and coreceptors In the most severely affected patients, it can cause AuQ Edit OK pneumonia and multiple organ failure leading to death Reports describe high death rates resulting from cardiac dysfunction, a comorbid condition in SARSCoV2 patients, while the primary cause and mechanisms remain unknown Here, we attempt to review clinical reports of SARSCoV2 patients in order to provide insight into a possible mechanism that allows hyperferritinemia the presence of excess ironbinding protein to cause cardiac dysfunction in SARSCoV2 patients Such insights are an important avenue towards understanding the mechanism of cardiac dysfunction in SARSCoV2 patients and developing remedies for the same,Substantial efforts have been recently committed to develop COVID19 medications, and Hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with Azithromycin has been promoted as a repurposed treatment While these drugs may increase cardiac toxicity risk, cardiomyocyte mechanisms underlying this risk remain poorly understood in humans Therefore, we evaluated the proarrhythmia risk and inotropic effects of these drugs in the cardiomyocyte contractilitybased model of the human heart We found Hydroxychloroquine to have a low proarrhythmia risk, while Chloroquine and Azithromycin were associated with high risk Hydroxychloroquine proarrhythmia risk changed to high with low level of K, while high level of Mg2 protected against proarrhythmic effect of high Hydroxychloroquine concentrations Moreover, therapeutic concentration of Hydroxychloroquine caused no enhancement of elevated temperatureinduced proarrhythmia Polytherapy of Hydroxychloroquine plus Azithromycin and sequential application of these drugs were also found to influence proarrhythmia risk categorization Hydroxychloroquine proarrhythmia risk changed to high when combined with Azithromycin at therapeutic concentration However, Hydroxychloroquine at therapeutic concentration impacted the cardiac safety profile of Azithromycin and its proarrhythmia risk only at concentrations above therapeutic level We also report that Hydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine, but not Azithromycin, decreased contractility while exhibiting multiion channel block features, and Hydroxychloroquines contractility effect was abolished by Azithromycin Thus, this study has the potential to inform clinical studies evaluating repurposed therapies, including those in the COVID19 context Additionally, it demonstrates the translational value of the human cardiomyocyte contractilitybased model as a key early discovery path to inform decisions on novel therapies for COVID19, malaria, and inflammatory diseases,As part of the response to the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic, cardiothoracic training programs quickly transitioned midinterview season toward a virtual format This monumental and rapid undertaking led to the adoption of novel virtual interviewing techniques, many of which have been developed and partially rolled out by other specialties for years The COVID19 pandemic is still here, and when the end will be in sight is unclear However, most, if not all, of the novel interview techniques that were rapidly adopted by cardiothoracic training programs during the 2020 interview season will continue to be relevant even after the pandemic and need for social distancing subsides In this literature review, we highlight techniques that can be used by cardiothoracic training programs to virtually showcase their attributes and strengths to give applicants as realistic of a view of the program as possible Such efforts include developing and emphasizing a social media presence, expanding information within training program websites, broadcasting virtual educational content, and creating virtual tours In addition, we will review approaches toward structuring a virtual interview day to provide candidates with a deeper glimpse into the inner workings of the program We can use this opportunity provided by the COVID19 pandemic to develop innovative methods of conducting fellowship interviews that may persist long into the future, as we consider limitations historically caused by finances, scheduling, clinical responsibilities, and family needs,BACKGROUND Racialethnic and economic disparities in access to care among persons with asthma and COPD have been described, but longterm access trends are unclear RESEARCH QUESTION Has health coverage, and access to care and medications among adults with airway disease improved, and have disparities narrowed STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Using the 19972018 National Health Interview Survey, we examined timetrends in health coverage and the affordability of medical care and prescription drugs for adults with asthma and COPD, overall and by income and raceethnicity We performed multivariable linear probability regressions comparing coverage and access in 2018 to 1997 RESULTS Our sample included 76,843 adults with asthma and 30,548 with COPD Among adults with asthma, uninsurance rose in the first decade of the twentyfirst century, peaking with the Great Recession, but fell after implementation of the Affordable Care Act ACA From 1997 to 2018, the uninsurance rate among adults with asthma decreased from 194 to 96 adjusted 927 percentage points 95CI71,115 However, the proportions delayingforegoing medical care due to cost, or going without medications did not improve Racialethnic and economic disparities present in 1997 persisted over the study period Trends and disparities among those with COPD were similar, although the proportion going without needed medications worsened, rising by an adjusted 78 percentage points INTERPRETATION Coverage losses among persons with airway disease in the first decade of the twentyfirst century were more than reversed by the ACA, but neither care affordability nor disparities improved Further reform is needed to close these gaps,Introduction The Novel coronavirus, sarscov2, is responsible for the recent pandemic Although it mostly affects adults, children of all ages, including neonates, can become ill with Covid19, as well The real prevalence rate of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 in children is unknown However, the severity of symptoms in children and neonates is less than in adults Regarding the new presentation of this disease, the current study has reported a case series of COVID19 in neonates Case Presentation In this article, 10 neonates with COVID 19 admitted to our neonatal intensive care units are reported All reported neonates had general suspicious symptoms of COVID 19 with positive results for SARSCoV2 assessed by polymerase chain reaction PCR from the nasopharynx area or nose of the patients All neonates, except for two of them, were term neonates One case had openheart surgery for congenital heart disease transposition of the great arteries TGA The patients aged 22 days on admission The most frequent symptom was fever Severe respiratory symptoms were reported in two cases Also, abnormal radiologic findings in the chest xray were detected in two cases Regarding the lack of significant respiratory symptoms in most of the patients, the lung computed tomography CT scan was taken just from one neonate Leukopenia WBC  5000mm3 was detected in one case, with no lymphopenia in all neonates The positive Creactive protein test was not found in all cases No patient was treated by special antiviral agents for COVID19, and usual antibiotic treatment for neonatal sepsis was administered for all cases All patients, except for one, survived with no significant sequela of the disease Conclusions This study demonstrated that clinical manifestations, as well as laboratory and radiologic findings of COVID19, are milder in neonates than in the older ages Hence, it can be argued that the prognosis of COVID19 in the neonatal period is generally good,Arterial hypertension represented one of the most common comorbidities in patients with COVID19 However, the impact of hypertension on outcome in COVID19 patients is not clear Close connections between inflammation and blood pressure BP have been described, and inflammation plays a key role in the outcome for patients with COVID19 Whether hypertension impairs the relationship between inflammation, BP, and outcomes in this context is not known The aim of this study was to examine the effects of the interactions between inflammation and hypertension status on BP and clinical outcome in patients hospitalized with COVID19 We designed a retrospective study in 129 patients hospitalized with COVID19 at Toulouse University Hospital The hospital outcome was admission to the intensive care unit or death The inflammatory markers were blood Creactive protein level CRP, neutrophil to lymphocyte, and platelet to lymphocyte ratios We identified strong correlations between CRP P,Since the outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 in China, many researchers have reported the chest CT manifestations of COVID19 pneumonia Highresolution CT HRCT of the lung can provide important clues to understand the progressive behaviour of COVID19 pneumonia This pictorial essay discusses the early features and potential progressive behaviour of COVID19 on HRCT of the lung,,Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia FH are likely at increased risk for COVID19 complications in the acute phase of the infection, and for a long time thereafter Because in FH patients the level of low density lipoprotein cholesterol LDLC is elevated from birth and it correlates with the degree of systemic endothelial dysfunction, both heterozygous FH HeFH patients and, in particular, homozygous FH HoFH patients have a dysfunctional endothelium prone to further damage by the direct viral attack and the hyperinflammatory reaction typical of severe COVID19 Evidence to date shows the benefit of statin use in patients with COVID19 In FH patients, the focus should therefore be on the effective lowering of LDLC levels, the root cause of the expected excess vulnerability to COVID19 infection in these patients Moreover, the ongoing use of statins and other lipidlowering therapies should be encouraged during the COVID pandemic to mitigate the risk of cardiovascular complications from COVID19 For the reduction of the excess risk in FH patients with COVID19, we advocate stringent adherence to the guideline determined LDLC levels for FH patients, or maybe even to lower levels Unfortunately, epidemiologic data are lacking on the severity of COVID19 infections, as well as the number of acute cardiac events that have occurred in FH subjects during the COVID19 pandemic Such data need to be urgently gathered to learn how much the risk for, and the severity of COVID19 in FH are increased,,BACKGROUND Vitamin D VitD deficiency has been reported to be associated with respiratory tract infection In this work we evaluated the concentration of VitD in COVID19 patients experiencing acute respiratory infections of different levels of severity excluding those who underwent invasive respiratory support METHODS The levels of serum VitD and Creactive protein CRP were analyzed in 118 consecutive hospitalized COVID19 patients 74M, 44F, confirmed with rRTPCR Of these patients with ventilation support 52 441 received oxygen via nasal cannula, oxygen mask or an oxygen mask with a reservoir, 48 407 were on a continuous positive airway pressure device CPAP and 18 15,3 on noninvasive mechanical ventilation NIMV RESULTS The median values range of VitD and of CRP were 151 ngmL 13733 and 142 mgL 501512, respectively A negative correlation from VitD levels and those of CRP correlation coefficient  0259 P0005 was observed VitD levels in O2 support patients were significantly higher than in both CPAP and NIMV patients No statistical differences were found for CRP levels P0834 among the three type of oxygen support Fewer patients with O2 support had VitD 30 ngmL and 20 ngmL than CPAP and NIMV patients There were no relationships between VitD and the three classes of IgM P0419 and of IgG P0862 SARSCoV2 antibodies values The behavior was the same for CRP CONCLUSIONS Our study shows that a significant proportion of COVID19 patients have a VitD deficiency and that this condition is more frequent in CPAP and in NIMV patients,,,Introduction the Novel Coronavirus Disease Covid19 can infect the respiratory tract, causing mild to deadly respiratory impairment It is still unknown whether patients recovering from Covid19 will develop respiratory sequelae This study aims to evaluate the respiratory and functional condition of Covid19 recovered patients, stratified according to their worst pF during hospitalization for Covid19 Method 86 Covid19 recovered subjects performed, after 39 days on average, physical examination and arterial blood gas ABG examination, pulmonary function tests PFTs with diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide DLco, and sixminute walk test 6MWT Subjects also quantified their dyspnoea and cough using a visual analogic scale VAS at threetime points previously than COVID infection, during COVID hospitalization, and currently The 76 subjects with reliable ABG during the hospitalization were stratified in three groups according to their worst PaO2FiO2 ratio pF mild pF300 n  38 moderate 200pF300 n  30, severe pF  200 n  20 Results In this cohort, Covid19 recovered subjects still reported significant residual dyspnoea at the visit time The severe subjects group showed a lower Total Lung Capacity TLC, a lower DLco, and a worse 6MWT performance Conclusion After Covid19, respiratory and functional impairments may persist These impairments seem to be more severe as much as minor was the patient worst pF during hospitalization These patients should receive a strict followup,,Interleukin 6 IL6, a cytokine produced by various cells of the human body macrophages, lymphocytes, astrocytes, ischemic myocytes, endothelial cells has both proinflammatory and antiinflammatory properties, being a key component in regulating various physiologic and pathological processes The structure of this molecule and the receptor system it possesses are important due to the different activities that IL6 can exert through transsignaling proinflammatory activities are mediated, while through classic signaling, IL6 is responsible for antiinflammatory and regenerative activities IL6 signaling is involved in coronary artery disease and the global COVID19 pandemic This proatherogenic cytokine reaches elevated serum levels in the cytokine storm generated by SARSCoV2, and is also associated with smoking or obesityclassic cardiovascular risk factors which promote inflammatory states IL6 levels are proportionally correlated with dyslipidemia, hypertension and glucose dysregulation, and they are associated with poor outcomes in patients with unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction IL6 targeting for treatment development not only in cardiovascular disease and COVID19 is still a matter of ongoing research, although tocilizumab has proven to be effective in reducing the proatherogenic effects of IL6 and is suggested to improve COVID19 patient survival,Corresponding Author,,,,Pericardial inflammation is a recognised feature of coronavirus disease COVID19 The authors herein present the case of a female with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 SARSCoV2 infection who developed a large and lifethreatening pericardial effusion over a few days following the onset of pericarditis, despite prompt commencement of treatment This was successfully drained, and she was discharged in stable condition on oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and colchicineAt 6week followup she had made a full recovery, and repeat echocardiography demonstrated no recurrence of effusion or evidence of constrictive physiology,The paper describes a clinical case of hypersensitivity pneumonitis in a young patient during the COVID19 pandemic when the patient having complaints of dyspnea and interstitial lung changes as ground glass opacity was initially unambiguously diagnosed with viral COVIDrelated bilateral pneumonia The chief computed tomography manifestations in the lung were infiltrative inflammatory changes as numerous areas of predominantly interstitial infiltration by the type of ground glass, with consolidation areas and reticular changes, varying in extent, peripheral localization, mainly in the lower lobes and with the 2550 involvement of the right and left lung parenchyma The diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis was confirmed by cytological and histological examinations of the biopsy material obtained during bronchoscopy using a set of biopsies and endobronchial cryobiopsyThis clinical case demonstrates that the chest computed tomography detection of pulmonary ground glasstype changes is a reason for further patient examinations and requires morphological verification of the diagnosis, since the cost of a diagnostic error is the life of a patient,The prevalence of asthma is increasing rapidly, worldwide, due to changing geneenvironment interactions The rate of rise is more in resource poor nations due to lack of knowledge and nonavailability of expertise Monitoring of lung functions is mandatory for diagnosis and further management of asthmatic patients Spirometry, the widely available investigation, is the gold standard test used for mapping pulmonary dynamicity It has got its own limitations in the form of operational difficulties in children, the elderly, and in those with neuromuscular or behavioral issues In the current era of COVID19 pandemic, the utility of spirometry has been further restricted to selected cohort only, due to potential risk of viral transmission during the procedure Oscillometry technique has been used previously, to monitor lung functions, with promising results Ultrasonic waves of various frequencies accompany the tidal breath of patients and respiratory impedance is calculated by measured pressure and flow signals from exhaled breath The results are interpreted in the form of resistance, reactance, resonant frequency, and reactance area Various manufacturers have developed different mechanical models with slight variation in impulse pattern till date There are certain distinct advantages of oscillometry over spirometry Being tidal breathbased maneuver, it is more child friendly People with neuromuscular weakness, cognitive limitations, and the elderly can easily perform it with only minor understanding and effort Oscillometry is more sensitive than spirometry in detecting peripheral airway diseases Postbronchodilator reversibility can be evaluated by comparing with the baseline respiratory characteristics Their utility in restrictive diseases and vocal cord dysfunction has also been explored Less aerosol generation during the normal tidal breath is another advantage of oscillometry, over spirometry needing forceful efforts, which makes it more suitable for use in viral pandemic situations for monitoring patients with both asthma and pneumonia More research is needed, in various geographic locations and heterogeneous populations, to devise the normative data of oscillometric parameters Simultaneously, there is an urgent need for standardization of available machines at global platform,COVID19 is a world public health emergency caused by the new coronavirus, SARSCoV2 Many drugs were repurposed as a treatment for COVID19 patients including Chloroquine CQ CQ is a bitter taste receptor agonist reported to relax the airways suggesting a role in preventing disease severity of COVID19 patients with asthma,Sepsis caused acute lung injury ALI is a kind of serious disease in critically ill patients with very high morbidity and mortality Recently, it has been demonstrated that Golgi is involved in the process of oxidative stress However, whether Golgi stress is associated with oxidative stress in septic induced acute lung injury has not been elucidated In this research, we found that lipopolysaccharide LPS induced oxidative stress, apoptosis, inflammation and Golgi morphology changes in acute lung injury both in vivo and in vitro The knockout of heme oxygenase1HO1 aggravated oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and reduced the expression of Golgi matrix protein 130 GM130, mannosidase Ⅱ, Golgiassociated protein golgin A1 Golgin 97, and increased the expression of Golgi phosphoprotein 3 GOLPH3, which caused the fragmentation of Golgi Furtherly, the activation of hypoxia inducible factor1α HIF1αHO1 pathway, attenuates Golgi stress and oxidative stress by increasing the levels of GM130, mannosidase Ⅱ, Golgin 97, and decreasing the expression of GOLPH3 both in vivo and in vitro Therefore, the activation of HO1 plays a crucial role in alleviating sepsisinduced acute lung injury by regulating Golgi stress, oxidative stress, which may provide a therapeutic target for the treatment of acute lung injury,Hypertension is the most considerable but treatable risk factor for cardiovascular disease Although physicians prescribe multiple antihypertensive drugs and promote lifestyle modifications, the realworld blood pressure BP control rate remains poor To improve BP target achievement, we developed a novel digital therapeuticthe HERB software systemu2009to manage hypertension Here, we performed a randomized pilot study to assess the safety and efficacy of the HERB system for hypertension We recruited 146 patients with essential hypertension from March 2018 to March 2019 We allocated eligible patients to the intervention group HERB systemxa0xa0standard lifestyle modification or control group standard lifestyle modification alone The primary outcome was the mean change from baseline to 24xa0weeks in 24hour systolic BP SBP measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ABPM The baseline characteristics in each group were well balanced the mean age was approx 57xa0years, and 67 were male In the primary end point at 24xa0weeks, HERB intervention did not lower the mean change of 24hour SBP by ABPM compared with the controls adjusted difference 066xa0mmHg pxa0xa078 In an exploratory analysis focusing on antihypertensive drugnaïve patients aged 65, the effects of the HERB intervention were significantly greater than the control for reducing 24hour SBP by ABPM at 16xa0weeks adjusted difference 76xa0mmHg pxa0xa0013 and morning home SBP at 24xa0weeks adjusted differencexa0xa060xa0mmHg pxa0xa0012 Thus, the HERB intervention did not achieve a primary efficacy end point However, we observed that antihypertensive drugnaïve adult hypertensive patients aged 65xa0years could be a potential HERB systemeffective target for further investigations of the efficacy of the system,BACKGROUNDAIMS Ketogenic diet therapies KDTs offer a needed therapeutic option for patients with drugresistant epilepsy The current study investigated biochemical and anthropometric indices of cardiovascular disease CVD risk in adults with epilepsy treated with KDT over 6 months METHOD 65 adults with epilepsy naïve to diet therapy were enrolled in a prospective longitudinal study and instructed on modified Atkins diet MAD use Seizure frequency, anthropometric measures, blood levels of total cholesterol, lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol, highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoproteins A1 and B, and lipoprotein subfractions were assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months RESULTS Subsequent to study enrollment, 34 participants were lost to followup, elected not to start, or stopped MAD prior to study completion, leaving a total of 31 participants in the study at 6 months Compared to baseline, participants on MAD showed significant reductions in median seizure frequencyweek, weight, body mass index, waist and hip circumference, and percent body fat at 3 and 6 months Compared to baseline, participants on MAD for 3 months showed significantly increased levels of total, small and medium LDL particles, ApoB and ApoBA1 ratio At 6 months, only small LDL particles and ApoB levels remained elevated and levels of ApoA1 had risen, suggesting possible compensatory adaptation over time CONCLUSIONS This study provides evidence demonstrating the efficacy and cardiovascular safety of 6 months of MAD use by adults with epilepsy It also highlights an index of CVD risk  small LDL particles  that should be closely monitored Trial registration ClinicalTrialsgov identifier NCT02694094,This paper presents the computational fluidic modeling of a fluidic oscillator for the conversion of continuous positive airway pressure CPAP machines into emergency pressure support mechanical ventilators by providing a periodic pressure output to patients The design addresses potential ventilator shortages resulting from the ongoing COVID‐19 pandemic, or future pandemics by converting a positive pressure source into a mechanical ventilator with a part that is i inexpensive, ii easily manufactured without the need for specialized equipment, iii simple to assemble and maintain, iv does not require any electronics, and v has no moving components that could be prone to failure A Computational Fluid Dynamics CFD model is used to assess flow characteristics of the system, and a prototype is developed and tested with a commercial benchtop respiratory stimulator The simulations show clinically relevant periodic oscillation with outlet pressures in the range of 8‐20 cmH2O and end‐user‐tunable frequencies in the range of 3‐6 seconds respiratory rate RR of 10‐20 breaths per minute The prototype can respond to disrupted oscillations, an analogue for patient‐initiated breaths The fluidic oscillator presented here functions at physiologically‐relevant pressures and frequencies, demonstrating potential as a low‐cost, readily deployable means for converting CPAP machines into emergency use ventilators This article is protected by copyright All rights reserved,BackgroundFailed airway management is the major contributor for anaesthesiarelated morbidity and mortality Cannotintubatecannotventilate scenarios are the most critical emergency in airway management, and belong to the worst imaginable scenarios in an anaesthetists life In such situations, apnoeic oxygenation might be useful to avoid hypoxaemia Anaesthesia guidelines recommend careful preoxygenation and application of high flow oxygen in difficult intubation scenarios to prevent episodes of deoxygenation In this study, we evaluated the decrease in oxygen concentration in a model when using different strategies of oxygenation using a special oxygenation laryngoscope, nasal oxygen, nasal high flow oxygen, and controlMethodsIn this experimental study we compared no oxygen application as a control, standard pure oxygen application of 10u2009l·minu20091 via nasal cannula, high flow 90 oxygen application at 20u2009l·minu20091 using a special nasal high flow device, and pure oxygen application via our oxygenation laryngoscope at 10u2009l·minu20091 We preoxygenated a simulation lung to 97 oxygen concentration and connected this to the trachea of a manikin model simulating apnoeic oxygenation Decrease in oxygen concentration in the simulation lung was measured continuously for 20u2009minResultsOxygen concentration in the simulation lung dropped from 97u2009u20091 at baseline to 40u2009u20091 in the no oxygen group, to 80u2009u20091 in the standard nasal oxygen group, and to 73u2009u20092 in the high flow nasal oxygenation group However, it remained at 96u2009u20090 in the oxygenation laryngoscope group p,BackgroundSleepdisordered breathing SDB is highly prevalent in acute ischaemic stroke and is associated with worse functional outcome and increased risk of recurrence Recent metaanalyses suggest the possibility of beneficial effects of nocturnal ventilatory treatments continuous positive airway pressure CPAP or adaptive servoventilation ASV in stroke patients with SDB The evidence for a favourable effect of early SDB treatment in acute stroke patients remains, however, uncertainMethodseSATIS is an openlabel, multicentre 6 centres in 4 countries, interventional, randomized controlled trial in patients with acute ischaemic stroke and significant SDB Primary outcome of the study is the impact of immediate SDB treatment with noninvasive ASV on infarct progression measured with magnetic resonance imaging in the first 3u2009months after stroke Secondary outcomes are the effects of immediate SDB treatment vs nontreatment on clinical outcome independence in daily functioning, new cardiocerebrovascular events including death, cognition and

management beyond hospital, which is hard to implement in traditional care settings Integrated care combined with information technology can promote highquality healthcare services across the lifecourse However, few studies have applied a customized integrated care model in communitybased hypertension management in China, catering to the emerging threemanager mode This study aims to identify the effectiveness of a pathwaydriven eHealthbased integrated model that implemented as a fullfeatured telehealth system to facilitate standardized management of hypertension in ChinaMethodsThe trial has been designed as a 1year, nonblinded superiority trial with two parallel groups A total of 402 hypertensive patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be recruited and randomized with a 11 allocation All the participants will receive a mobile device for selfmanagement, which is a part of our telehealth system Participants in the control group will only use the device for BP measurement and receive regular followups from care providers according to the guidelines Participants in the intervention group will gain full access to the system and receive intervention based on the proposed model a welldesigned coordinated care pathway consisting of 9 tasks Outcomes will be measured mainly on three occasions at inclusion, at 6u2009months, and at 12u2009months The primary outcome is mean change in systolic blood pressure over a 12month period Secondary outcomes include changes in diastolic blood pressure, biochemical indexes related to

leading to chronic lung disease is a common consequence of premature birth and mechanisms responsible for early and progressive airway remodeling are not completely understood Current therapeutic options are only partially effective in reducing the burden of neonatal airway disease and premature decline of lung function Gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide H2S has been recently recognized for its therapeutic potential in lung diseases AREAS COVERED Contradictory to its wellknown toxicity at high concentrations, H2S has been characterized to have antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and antiapoptotic properties at physiological concentrations In the respiratory system, endogenous H2S production participates in late lung development and exogenous H2S administration has a protective role in a variety of diseases such as acute lung injury and chronic pulmonary hypertension and fibrosis Literature searches performed using NCBI PubMed without publication date limitations were used to construct this review, which highlights the dichotomous role of H2S in the lung, and explores its promising beneficial effects in lung diseases EXPERT OPINION The emerging role of H2S in pathways involved in chronic lung disease of prematurity along with its recent use in animal models of BPD highlight H2S as a potential novel candidate in protecting lung function following preterm birth,The incidence of acute kidney injury AKI as a result of acute cardiac failure is an increasingly frequent phenomenon driven by  demographic change and medical progress The main underlying pathophysiologic mechanism of this socalled cardiorenal syndrome typexa01 CRS1 is venous congestion in conjunction with neurohumoral activation and inflammation The prevention, diagnosis and treatment of CRS1 focus on treating the cardiac condition including decongestive recompensation This article provides nephrologists with the current definitions and differential diagnoses of acute heart failure In addition, the epidemiology and pathophysiology of AKI in the course of cardiac insufficiency are described Axa0stepwise approach for treatment and monitoring is provided according to the current consensus and the evidence This includes mechanisms and principles of the use of diuretics Finally, pertinent interventional studies on the pharmacotherapy of congestive heart failure are summarized,Background Parkinsons disease PD is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease and is associated with cognitive dysfunction Obstructive sleep apnea OSA has been linked with cognitive dysfunction in the general population and in PD Treatment with positive airway pressure PAP, can improve cognition in the general population and in patients with other neurodegenerative diseases However, the effect of PAP therapy on cognitive function has not been well studied in PD Methods This randomized controlled trial will assess the effect of 6 months of PAP therapy versus placebo on global cognitive function in PD patients with OSA and reduced baseline cognition Secondary outcomes will include quality of life and other nonmotor symptoms of PD Exploratory outcomes will be specific domains of neurocognitive function and symptoms of REM sleep behaviour disorder Conclusions PDrelated cognitive dysfunction often evolves towards dementia and has substantial personal, social and healthcare costs Few interventions have been shown to improve cognition in PD to date If positive, results from our study could prove OSA to be a new therapeutic target relevant to cognition and would support more systematic screening for OSA in PD patients with cognitive decline Trial Registration Trial registration number is NCT02209363,Up to 5 of patients with COVID 19 become seriously unwell due to respiratory failure of which a proportion require referral to the Intensive Care Unit ICU We designed a protocol to use CPAP early on the respiratory ward in confirmed Covid patients to reduce the need for ICU Clinical trials are ongoing examining the effectiveness of CPAP versus other forms of oxygen delivery in reducing mortality1 Covid patients in respiratory failure for escalation to ICU were considered for a trial of CPAP when their oxygen requirements exceeded 4Lminute CPAP was started at a positive end expiratory pressure PEEP of 5 cm H2O and up titrated to maintain oxygen saturations greater than 94 Demographic information, PEEP pressures, duration on CPAP, time to intubation if CPAP failed, ICU admission, hospital discharge and 60 day mortality was collected on CPAP responders and CPAP non responders over a sixweek period 43353 patients 12 admitted with Covid pneumonia to our hospital in respiratory failure were deemed suitable for a CPAP trial and were for escalation to ICU if CPAP failed Table 1 2343 54 responded favourably to CPAP and avoided ICU Males were more likely to fail CPAP 48 vs 75, p007 within the first day 5 vs 1 day, p0001 Hospital length of stay in CPAP responders was considerably shorter than CPAP non responders Differences between CPAP responders and CPAP non responders in Covid Pneumonia patients Over half of patients trialled on CPAP tolerated it well and avoided ICU admission with a shorter hospital stay These were younger patients with relatively few comorbidities Those who failed CPAP were mostly male and did so within the first 24 hours The nonresponders to CPAP all survived to hospital discharge Early CPAP use in this group has had no adverse outcomes to date More work is needed to look at the use of early CPAP in older patients with more medical comorbidities in respiratory failure due to Covid pneumonia RECOVERYRS Respiratory support  respiratory strategies in COVID19 CPAP, Highflow, and standard care Available httpwwwisrctncomISRCTN16912075,During the COVID19 pandemic, the use of continuous positive airway pressure CPAP for type 1 respiratory failure T1RF has been shown to possibly delay or avoid the need for intubation1 However, no study has identified patient characteristics that may be associated with more favourable outcomes We hypothesised that patients with a higher body mass index BMI would have better outcomes with CPAP as they are more likely to have undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnoea OSA and upper airway resistance We retrospectively reviewed use of CPAP in a ward setting for T1RF secondary to COVID19 between 20320 and 20420 In addition to patient demographic data and comorbidities, we assessed oxygen requirements preCPAP, mean CPAP pressures and survival with CPAP alone CPAP success 41 ward patients received CPAP Patients baseline characteristics are shown in table 1 All were deemed suitable for intubation and ventilation IV prior to commencing CPAP Nine out of 41 22 did not require IV and survived to discharge with CPAP alone CPAP failed in 32 patients 78 30 required IV ITU survival 67 and two patients were palliated Patients with CPAP success all had BMI 25 kgm2 median BMI 300 281370 kgm2 This was significantly higher than in those where CPAP failed 47 had BMI 25 kgm2 median 249 kgm2 229281, p0005 375 n12 of patients where CPAP failed had a smoking history, of which only 1 83 had a diagnosis of COPD, compared to 0 of CPAP success patients p0023 Demographics, comorbidities, investigations, observations and Continuous Positive Airway Pressure CPAP data for all patients Nonparametric data, therefore median and interquartile ranges presented All other data are presented as means  standard deviation Abbreviations CXR  Chest Xray In our small cohort, CPAP alone was successful in 22 This was lower than another recent study 1, however, our patient cohort had more comorbidities Patients with a higher BMI had significantly greater CPAP success This may be due to an increased number of undiagnosed OSA in this cohort and merits further investigation While smokers had an increased risk of CPAP failure, none of the patients were current smokers and there was limited data on packyear history Further studies are necessary to identify factors that may point to greater CPAP success during COVID19 Nightingale R, et al BMJ Open Respir Res 2020 Jul71e000639,SARSCoV2 COVID19 is associated with increased thrombosis Here, we demonstrate patterns of pulmonary vascular disease in COVID19 including classical acute pulmonary embolism and subsegmental perfusion defects in the absence of acute pulmonary embolism suggestive of microvascular thrombosis,Coronavirus disease 19 COVID19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2, first emerged in late 2019 and has since rapidly become a global pandemic SARSCoV2 infection causes damages to the lung and other organs The clinical manifestations of COVID19 range widely from asymptomatic infection, mild respiratory illness to severe pneumonia with respiratory failure and death Autopsy studies demonstrate that diffuse alveolar damage, inflammatory cell infiltration, edema, proteinaceous exudates, and vascular thromboembolism in the lung as well as extrapulmonary injuries in other organs represent key pathological findings Herein, we hypothesize that GPR4 plays an integral role in COVID19 pathophysiology and is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of COVID19 GPR4 is a proinflammatory G proteincoupled receptor GPCR highly expressed in vascular endothelial cells and serves as a gatekeeper to regulate endotheliumblood cell interaction and leukocyte infiltration GPR4 also regulates vascular permeability and tissue edema under inflammatory conditions Therefore, we hypothesize that GPR4 antagonism can potentially be exploited to mitigate the hyperinflammatory response, vessel hyperpermeability, pulmonary edema, exudate formation, vascular thromboembolism and tissue injury associated with COVID19,COVID19 presents with acute symptoms of cough, phlegm and pyrexia and can cause severe acute respiratory distress Little is known about the symptoms patients face following an acute admission for COVID19 and there is no validated questionnaire to assess patients This cross sectional study aims to explore the symptoms patients display following an admission with COVID19 using the COPD Assessment Test CAT This was an observational cohort study following patients who recovered from COVID19 Participants were called after discharge to assess their ongoing symptoms including the CAT and their rehabilitation needs Correlations between characteristics and CAT scores were performed using Spearmans rank test 131 patients were assessed following their admission 77 59 male, mean SD age 6014 31 had a preexisting respiratory condition Their mean SD hospital stay was 1012 days and 21 16 participants required mechanical ventilation The meanSD time to follow up call was 3218 days postdischarge Total CAT scores ranged from 0 to 34 with mean of 11478 52 of patients had a CAT score 10 with scores highest for the breathlessness, activities, sleep, confidence and energy items Of the patients without a preexisting respiratory condition 42 had a score of 10 and in patients with a preexisting respiratory condition this proportion was 75 Breathlessness, activity limitations and energy and were the highest reported symptoms for both groups There were no statistically significant correlations for the CAT with length of stay, number of days ventilated, selfreported physical activity or time from discharge The CAT total and item scores can provide insight into the severity of symptom burden for patients following a hospitalisation from COVID19 This may be a useful tool to identify rehabilitation needs Jones PW, Harding G, Berry P, et al Development and first validation of the COPD Assessment test Eur

Pulmonary Disease 20129175183,The COVID19 pandemic saw unprecedented pressure placed upon healthcare services and demand for additional Critical Care capacity National guidance recommended CPAP as a treatment option for patients with severe hypoxaemic respiratory failure We present our experience and clinical outcomes of patients with severe COVID19 treated with CPAP Clinical data was prospectively collated for all patients treated with CPAP for COVID19 at two hospital sites Both sites used the same treatment algorithm, involving a stepwise progression of oxygen therapy, CPAP and escalation to mechanical ventilation if appropriate CPAP was delivered within ED resus, respiratory ward CPAP area, respiratory HDU or Intensive Care Unit ICU Inclusion criteria included confirmed SARSCoV2 infection by nasopharyngeal swab PCR age³18 FiO2³04 with increased work of breathing or FiO2³06 to maintain target oxygen saturation Level 2 or 3 treatment escalation plan TEP treatment with CPAP 115 patients were identified, 22 female Median age was 673692 years, and Clinical Frailty Score 219 At initiation of CPAP, SF ratio was 11887245 and supplemental oxygen was FiO208 Diabetes was present in 64, hypertension in 61, cardiac disease in 22 and respiratory disease in 17 84 patients had a Level 3 TEP 30day mortality in this group was 29 50 required escalation to invasive ventilation and 30day mortality was 50, reflective of early national data In those who avoided intubation, mortality was 11 31 patients had a Level 2 TEP, where CPAP was the ceiling of treatment 30day mortality was 74 Admission to ICU was avoided in 67 of 115 patients Mortality in this group was 40 Median CPAP use was 3111 days Survivor length of stay was 551894 days in ICU mechanically ventilated patients vs 11553 days in ward treated patients In patients with COVID19 and severe hypoxaemic respiratory failure, mortality was high Our results showed that intubation can be avoided in 50 of patients treated with CPAP 30day mortality in patients subsequently mechanically ventilated was 50 but was only 11 in those who avoided intubation Further work is needed to assess the impact of CPAP on clinical outcomes in patients with COVID19 pneumonia,The COVID19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on a number of patient populations, not least those with airways disease Despite initial conflicting data, subsequent research has shown COPD patients to be at increased risk from the virus Other coronaviruses are also well recognised as viral precipitants of exacerbations in airways disease Therefore, it was reasonable to anticipate that COVID19 would take a particular toll on this population We investigated the rate of acute exacerbations in a cohort of our airways disease patients to determine the impact the virus had Telephone consultations and review of electronic records of 149 patients from the COPDasthma clinic at a South London district general hospital during the period March 23rd  June 23rd 2020 were reviewed This corresponded to the date the United Kingdom was placed into lockdown due to the pandemic This was used to establish whether, i they had presented to ED with exacerbation symptoms, ii required inpatient admission, iii selfreported episodes of exacerbations and corroborated this with dispensation of rescue packs from GP records This data was then compared to the same period in 2019 using this methodology In total, in the equivalent time period in 2019 there were 72 reported exacerbations of COPD, with 25 requiring inpatient admission In the corresponding time period in 2020 there were 55 reported exacerbations, with 20 requiring inpatient admission This represents a 236 and 20 decrease respectively In the asthma group there was a decrease in total number of exacerbations from 13 in 2019 to 7 in 2020 462 and those requiring inpatient admission from 4 in 2019 to 1 in 2020 75 We observed a reduction in the number of acute exacerbations in our cohort during the lockdown period of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 This may reflect effective shielding by these patients, minimising exposure to precipitant pathogens However, it may also be related to other consequences of the lockdown period, such as reduced air pollution These findings are notable and may provide further insights into future management of airways disease,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 SARSCOV2, a novel coronavirus, originated as an epidemic respiratory illness in Wuhan, China COVID19 eventually spread to almost all countries and has now been declared a global pandemic disease by the World Health Organisation A plethora of research has explored the dynamics of different clinical entities related to SARSCOV2, in particular, COVID19 associated coagulopathy A large scale of patients have been reported to have developed pulmonary embolism without any other standard triggers or risk factors, leading to speculation that COVID19 is an independent risk factor for venous thromboembolism In addition to the development of thromboembolic complications such as pulmonary embolism, COVID19 has also been reported to have triggered disseminated intravascular coagulation DIC however, it is unclear whether pulmonary embolism was due to COVID19induced thrombosis or a result of coagulopathy secondary to DIC We describe a unique case of a COVID19 associated coagulopathy in a patient with confirmed pulmonary embolism along with an overt DIC Following diagnosis, the challenge was to identify the appropriate treatment modality for this unique situation The patient was treated with anticoagulants and steroids along with blood products The patients condition markedly improved and was clinically stable on discharge,BACKGROUND There is limited data concerning the prevalence of arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation AF, which may develop as a consequence of direct myocardial injury and the inflammatory state existing in COVID19 METHODS This singlecenter study included data concerning 658 COVID19 patients, who were hospitalized in our institute, between April 20th, 2020 and July 30th, 2020 Demographic data, findings of the imaging studies, and laboratory test results were retrieved from the institutional digital database RESULTS New onset AF NOAF was identified in 33 patients 5 Patients who developed AF were older 7242xa0xa0610 vs 5378xa0xa01380, p,The Article considers the argumentative issues of the diagnosis of the virusinduced bronchial asthma and recurrent obstructive bronchitis in the children of infant and preschool age, the commonality of their pathogenesis, the feasibility and efficiency of their therapy  using the monteleukast  the antileukotriene receptor inhibitor Along with the antiinflammatory properties of the monteleukast, the  potential antiviral activity discovered in it was considered, in particular, against the SARSCoV2 virus, which causes COVID19,,PurposeCardiotoxicity from antihuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2 HER2 therapy carries a short and longterm risk of incident heart failure and increased cardiovascular mortality in patients with breast cancer Interruptions in antiHER2 therapy due to cardiotoxicity can lead to suboptimal cancer treatment The purpose of this narrative review is to outline opportunities to optimize cardiovascular care in patients with HER2positive breast cancer to prevent interruptions in therapyMethodsThis casebased review presents the current literature on evidencebased strategies for personalized cardiotoxicity risk assessment, risk mitigation interventions, cardiac function surveillance tools, and management of asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction in breast cancer patients receiving antiHER2 therapyResultsPretreatment cardiac risk assessment incorporates both treatmentrelated risk factors and patientrelated risk factors for the development of cardiac dysfunction Prevention and monitoring strategies while on treatment utilize risk factor modification, imaging and biomarker surveillance Management of asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction due to antiHER2 therapy is evolving Permissive cardiotoxicity in asymptomatic patients while starting cardioprotective therapies requires close collaboration between oncology and cardiology, and referral to cardiooncology if availableConclusionsPatientcentered, multimodal strategies to prevent, detect, and manage cardiotoxicity from antiHER2 therapy are necessary to improve outcomes in patients with HER2positive breast cancer,BACKGROUND The number of hospitalized young coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 patients has increased significantly However, specific data about COVID19 patients under 65 years old who are admitted to the hospital are scarce METHODS The COVID19 patients under 65 years old who were admitted to the hospital in Sichuan Province, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, and Wuhan Red Cross Hospital were included in this study Demographic information, laboratory data and clinical treatment courses were extracted from electronic medical records Risk factors associated with oxygen therapy were explored RESULTS Eight hundred thirtythree COVID19 patients under 65 years old were included Of the included patients, 294 had one or more comorbidities Oxygen therapy was required in 631 of these patients, and the mortality was 29 among the oxygen therapy patients Fever odds ratio OR 2072, 95 confidence interval CI 13123271, p  0002, dyspnea OR 2522, 95 CI 12135243, p  0013, chest distress OR 2278, 95 CI 11604473, p  0017, elevated respiratory rate OR 1114, 95 CI 10101228, p  0031, and decreased albumin OR 0932, 95 CI 08800987, p  0016 and globulin levels OR 0929, 95 08810980, p  0007 were independent factors related to oxygen therapy CONCLUSIONS Oxygen therapy is highly required in COVID19 patients under 65 years old who are admitted to the hospital, but the success rate is high Respiratory failurerelated symptoms, elevated respiratory rate, low albumin and globulin levels, and fever at admission are independent risk factors related to the requirement of oxygen,Objectives Guidelines for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD have undergone significant changes Specifically, inhaled corticosteroids ICSs either alone or in combination with a longacting beta2agonist LABA are now firstline treatment for asthma, while longacting muscarinic antagonists alone or in combination with LABAs are firstline treatment of COPD Data on local availability, cost, and affordability of these medicines in The Gambia are unknown   Materials and Methods We surveyed all registered pharmacists in Gambia and calculated affordability indices relative to the prevailing wage of the lowest government worker   Results Eight out of 18 registered pharmacists responded to the survey Respondents were responsible for stocking 19 out 26 registered pharmacies in the country, resulting in a response rate of 44 Salbutamol inhalers were widely available, stocked by the central medical stores and 6 out of 8 surveyed pharmacists Only one pharmacist reported stocking beclometasone 50 mcg, budesonide 100 mcg, and fluticasone propionate 125 mcg inhalers Aminophylline was stocked by 48 pharmacists The price of salbutamol 100 mcg inhaler was Gambian Dalasi GMD 200 US 4, 4 days wages, while ipratropium bromide 20 mcg cost GMD 675 US 14, 15 days wages ICS maintenance inhalers at private pharmacies cost 15, 26, and 28 days wages for beclomethasone 50 mcg, fluticasone propionate 125 mcg, and budesonide 100 mcg, respectively Combination of ICSLABA inhaler was 26 days wages while tiotropium bromide 18 mcg affordability was 95 days wages   Conclusion Guideline recommended medications for the management of asthma and COPD in The Gambia are unavailable, expensive, and unaffordable,The objective of this study is to address the problem of predicting the risk of obstructive sleep apnea OSA from overnight breath recordings collected by a subject using a smartphone or an iPhone The dataset used in this study was collected at a health care facility and consists of breathing amplitudes of 42 subjects using the smart phone App ZeeAppnea A total of four data mining multilevel classifiers are used on the Fast Fourier Transform FFT of each time series, and prediction accuracies are computed The Random Forest RF and the Support Vector Machine SVM classifiers yielded the best results, with overall multilevel prediction accuracies of 93 and 90, respectively the overall multilevel prediction accuracy of manual interpretations of recordings was 55 The binary overall accuracies for the severe OSA class were 98 RF, 95 SVM and 69 manual interpretations Our results show that either RF or SVM can be used on the recordings obtained from ZeeAppnea instead of the timeconsuming manual interpretation of charts of breathing amplitudes by medical personnel, as this would improve prediction accuracy and automate the process of this screening application,BACKGROUND The coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 outbreak has caused a great impact in many countries Older people are more susceptible to the virus than other people As a good health exercise suitable for the elderly, Tai Chi has a positive impact on heart function, blood pressure, lung function, immunity, etc It can enhance cardiopulmonary function, increase the elasticity of blood vessels, and improve the bodys selfregulation function For the elder patients with COVID19, Tai Chi has outstanding merits METHODS We will search PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database, Wanfang Database, Clinical Trials and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry The complete process will include study selection, data extraction, risk of bias assessment and metaanalyses Endnote X93 will be used to manage data screening The statistical analysis will be completed by StataSE 151 software RESULTS This proposed study will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Tai Chi for the improvement of psychological pressure, cardiopulmonary function, and immunity in elderly COVID19 patients during the recovery period CONCLUSION The conclusion of this study will provide evidence to prove the safety and effectiveness of Tai Chi on elderly COVID19 patients during the recovery period ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This protocol will not evaluate individual patient information or infringe patient rights and therefore does not require ethical approval REGISTRATION PEROSPERO CRD42020220128,Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 report severe respiratory symptoms consistent with ARDS The clinical presentation of ARDS in COVID19 is often atypical, as patients with COVID19 exhibit a disproportionate hypoxemia compared with relatively preserved lung mechanics This pattern is more similar to neonatal respiratory distress syndrome secondary to surfactant deficiency, which has been shown to benefit from exogenous surfactant We present our experience with exogenous surfactant treatment in a patient with COVID19 experiencing COVID19related ARDS The patient responded with improved oxygenation, and we believe surfactant was the catalyst for the successful extubation and clinical improvement of the patient,BackgroundCOVID19 has caused considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide and cardiac involvement has been reported during infection The shortterm cardiac outcome in survivors of COVID19 is not knownObjectiveTo examine the heart of patients who survived COVID19 and to compare the cardiac outcome between patients who recovered from mildtomoderate or severe illnessMethodsWith use of ECG and echocardiography, we examined the heart of 105 patients who had been hospitalized with COVID19 and were consecutively recruited after hospital discharge while attending followup visits Survivors of COVID19 were compared with 105 matched controls We also compared the cardiac outcome and lung ultrasound scan between COVID19 patients who had mildtomoderate or severe illnessResultsCardiac data were collected a median of 41xa0days from the first detection of COVID19 Symptoms were present in a low percentage of patients In comparison with matched controls, no considerable structural or functional differences were observed in the heart of survivors of COVID19 Lung ultrasound scan detected significantly greater residual pulmonary involvement in COVID19 patients who had recovered from severe than mildtomoderate illness No significant differences were detected in ECG tracings nor were found in the left and right ventricular function of patients who had recovered from mildtomoderate or severe illnessConclusionsIn a shortterm followup, no abnormalities were identified in the heart of survivors of COVID19, nor cardiac differences were detected between patients who had different severity of illness With the limitations of a crosssectional study, these findings suggest that patients who recover from COVID19 do not have considerable cardiac sequelaeGraphic abstract,A total occlusion of the aorta is a rare condition however, while rare, it has a very high mortality rate Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 poses serious health problems, including vascular problems Inflammatory changes produced by viral infections can cause serious disturbances in the coagulation system Although cases showing a marked increase in thrombotic activity in the venous system have been presented, thrombosis in the arterial system, especially in the aorta, has rarely been reported Here, we present 2 patients admitted to our hospital with an acute aortic thrombosis,It is unknown whether some of the clinical parameters transmitted by remote monitoring RM of cardiac implanted devices could show recurrent patterns caused by COVID19 infection Our aim was to describe RM daily temporal trends for implantable cardioverter defibrillator ICD or cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator CRTD recipients during COVID19 infection A 65yearold woman with a CRTD had a sudden increase of approximately 15xa0bpm and 10xa0bpm in nocturnal and mean heart rate, respectively, 11 days before hospitalization for COVID19 pneumonia At the same time physical activity decreased progressively and continuously A 78yearold woman with an ICD showed significant changes in RM trends starting from the COVID19related symptoms strong decrease in physical activity, progressive increase in mean and nocturnal heart rate, irregular trend of heart rate variability, and rapid drop in thoracic impedance Two months later, on hospitalization, computed tomography showed a crazypaving pattern of the lungs, which is a clinical picture of COVID19 pneumonia with concomitant pleuralxa0effusion Learningxa0objective Patients with complications related to the COVID19 infection appeared to show variations in the remote monitoring RM temporal trends of clinical variables daily transmitted from implanted cardiac devices These changes may not be specific to COVID19, but owing to the severity of the pandemic, the use of RM to capture patients condition makes intuitive sense for early diagnosis, intervention, and additional followup in this highrisk population,,Background Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 may develop severe acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS The aim of the study was to explore the lung recruitability, individualized positive endexpiratory pressure PEEP, and prone position in COVID19associated severe ARDS Methods Twenty patients who met the inclusion criteria were studied retrospectively PaO2FiO2 680  103 mmHg The patients were ventilated under volumecontrolled mode with tidal volume of 6 mLkg predicted body weight The lung recruitability was assessed via the improvement of PaO2, PaCO2, and static respiratory system compliance Cstat from low to high PEEP 515 cmH2O Patients were considered recruitable if two out of three parameters improved Subsequently, PEEP was titrated according to the best Cstat The patients were turned to prone position for further 1820 h Results For recruitability assessment, average value of PaO2 was slightly improved at PEEP 15 cmH2O 680  103 vs 697  79 mmHg, baseline vs PEEP 15 cmH2O p  031 However, both PaCO2 and Cstat worsened PaCO2 725  71 vs 751  90 mmHg p  001 Cstat 175  35 vs 166  39 mlcmH2O p  005 Only four patients 20 were considered lung recruitable Individually titrated PEEP was higher than the baseline PEEP 80  21 cmH2O vs 5 cmH2O, p  0001 After 1820 h of prone positioning, investigated parameters were significantly improved compared to the baseline PaO2 824  155 mmHg PaCO2 672  64 mmHg Cstat 206  44 mlcmH2O All p  0001 vs baseline Conclusions Lung recruitability was very low in COVID19associated severe ARDS Individually titrated PEEP and prone positioning might improve lung mechanics and blood gasses,OBJECTIVES A high incidence of pulmonary embolism PE is reported in patients with critical coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 Neutrophils may contribute to this through a process referred to as immunothrombosis The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of neutrophil subpopulations in blood preceding the development of COVID19 associated PE METHODS We studied COVID19 patients admitted to the ICU of our tertiary hospital between 19032020 and 17052020 Pointofcare fully automated flow cytometry was performed prior to ICU admission, measuring the neutrophil activationmaturation markers CD10, CD11b, CD16 and CD62L Neutrophil receptor expression was compared between patients who did or did not develop PE as diagnosed on CT angiography during or after their ICU stay RESULTS Among 25 eligible ICU patients, 22 subjects were included for analysis, of whom nine developed PE The median IQR time between neutrophil phenotyping and PE occurrence was 9 712 days A significant increase in the immunesuppressive neutrophil phenotype CD16bright CD62Ldim was observed on the day of ICU admission Pxa0xa00014 in patients developing PE compared to patients who did not CONCLUSION The increase in this neutrophil phenotype indicates that the increased number of CD16bright CD62Ldim neutrophils might be used as prognostic marker to predict those patients that will develop PE in critical COVID19 patients,BackgroundCOVID19 is a systemic viral infection which mainly targets the human respiratory system with many secondary clinical manifestations especially affecting the hematopoietic system and haemostasis Few studies have highlighted the prognostic value of blood findings such as lymphopenia, neutrophillymphocyte ratio, plateletlymphocyte ratio, LDH, CRP, cardiac troponin, lowdensity lipoproteins and chest radiographic abnormality A study of progressions of blood and radiological results may help to identify patients at high risk of severe outcomes This systematic review aimed to assess the temporal progression of blood and radiology findings of patients with COVID19MethodsComprehensive systematic literature search was conducted on Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases to identify articles published for peripheral blood investigation and radiological results of COVID19 patientsResultsA total of 27 studies were included in this review The common laboratory features reported include lymphopenia, elevated levels of Creactive proteins and lactate dehydrogenase For radiological signs, groundglass opacifications, consolidations, and crazy paving patterns were frequently reported There is a correlation between lymphocyte count, neutrophil count and biomarkers such as Creactive proteins and lactate dehydrogenase at a later phase of the disease more than 7xa0days since onset of symptoms, lymphopenia worsens while neutrophil count, Creactive protein levels and lactate dehydrogenase levels increase Frequencies of groundglass opacifications and groundglass opacifications with consolidations decrease at a later phase of the disease while that of consolidation and crazy paving pattern rises as the disease progresses More extensive lung involvement was also seen more frequently in the later phasesConclusionThe correlation between temporal progression and the reported blood and radiological results may be helpful to monitor and evaluate disease progression and severity,BACKGROUND Atrial fibrillation AF is the most encountered arrhythmia and has been associated with worse inhospital outcomes OBJECTIVE This study was to determine the incidence of AF in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 as well as its impact on inhospital mortality METHODS Patients hospitalized with a positive COVID19 polymerase chain reaction test between March 1 and April 27, 2020, were identified from the common medical record system of 13 Northwell Health hospitals Natural language processing search algorithms were used to identify and classify AF Patients were classified as having AF or not AF was further classified as newonset AF vs history of AF RESULTS AF occurred in 1687 of 9564 patients 176 Of those, 1109 patients 657 had newonset AF Propensity score matching of 1238 pairs of patients with AF and without AF showed higher inhospital mortality in the AF group 543 vs 372 P  0001 Within the AF group, propensity score matching of 500 pairs showed higher inhospital mortality in patients with newonset AF as compared with those with a history of AF 552 vs 468 P  009 The risk ratio of inhospital mortality for newonset AF in patients with sinus rhythm was 156 95 confidence interval 142171 P  0001 The presence of cardiac disease was not associated with a higher risk of inhospital mortality in patients with AF P  1 CONCLUSION In patients hospitalized with COVID19, 176 experienced AF AF, particularly newonset, was an independent predictor of inhospital mortality,,,The immunopathology of COVID19 remains enigmatic, exhibiting immunodysregulation and T cell lymphopenia Monocytic myeloidderived suppressor cells MMDSC are T cell suppressors that expand in inflammatory conditions, but their role in acute respiratory infections remains unclear We studied blood and airways of COVID19 patients across disease severity at multiple timepoints MMDSC frequencies were elevated in blood but not in nasopharyngeal or endotracheal aspirates of COVID19 patients compared to controls MMDSCs isolated from COVID19 patients suppressed T cell proliferation and IFNg production partly via an arginase1 Arg1 dependent mechanism Furthermore, patients showed increased Arg1 and IL6 plasma levels COVID19 patients had fewer T cells, and displayed downregulated expression of the CD3ζ chain Ordinal regression showed that early MMDSC frequency predicted subsequent disease severity In conclusion, MMDSCs expand in blood of COVID19 patients, suppress T cells and strongly associate with disease severity, suggesting a role for MMDSCs in the dysregulated COVID19 immune response,,BackgroundPrevious reports have shown various cardiac complications to be associated with COVID19 including myocardial infarction, microembolic complications, myocardial injury, arrythmia, heart failure, coronary vasospasm, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, stress Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, pericarditis and myocarditis These COVID19 cardiac complications were associated with respiratory symptoms However, our case illustrates that COVID19 myopericarditis with cardiac tamponade can present without respiratory symptomsCase presentationA 58yearold Caucasian British woman was admitted with fever, diarrhoea and vomiting She developed cardiogenic shock and Transthoracic echocardiogram TTE found a pericardial effusion with evidence of cardiac tamponade A nasopharyngeal swab showed a COVID19 positive result, despite no respiratory symptoms on presentation A pericardial drain was inserted and vasopressor support required on intensive treatment unit ITU The drain was removed as she improved, an antibiotic course was given and she was discharged on day 12ConclusionsOur case demonstrates that patients without respiratory symptoms could have COVID19 and develop cardiac complications These findings can aid timely diagnosis of potentially lifethreatening COVID19 myopericarditis with cardiac tamponade,BACKGROUND The prevalence of diseases other than TB detected during chest Xray CXR screening is unknown in subSaharan Africa This represents a missed opportunity for identification and treatment of potentially significant disease Our aim was to describe and quantify nonTB abnormalities identified by TBfocused CXR screening during the 2016 Kenya National TB Prevalence Survey METHODS We reviewed a random sample of 1140 adult 15 years CXRs classified as abnormal, suggestive of TB or abnormal other during field interpretation from the TB prevalence survey Each image was read blinded to field classification and study radiologist read by two expert radiologists, with images classified into one of four major anatomical categories and primary radiological findings A third reader resolved discrepancies Prevalence and 95 CIs of abnormalities diagnosis were estimated FINDINGS Cardiomegaly was the most common nonTB abnormality at 259 out of 1123 231, 95 CI 206 to 256, while cardiomegaly with features of cardiac failure occurred in 17 out of 1123 15, 95 CI 09 to 24 We also identified chronic pulmonary pathology including suspected COPD in 32 95 CI 23 to 44 and nonspecific patterns in 46 95 CI 35 to 60 Prevalence of activeTB and severe postTB lung changes was 36 95 CI 26 to 48 and 14 95 CI 08 to 23, respectively INTERPRETATION Based on radiological findings, we identified a wide variety of nonTB abnormalities during populationbased TB screening TB prevalence surveys and active case finding activities using mass CXR offer an opportunity to integrate disease screening efforts FUNDING National Institute for Health Research IMPALAgrant reference 1613635,,From the perspective of epidemiology, viral immunology and current clinical research, pulmonary fibrosis may become one of the complications of patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID19 Cytokine storm is a major cause of new coronavirus death The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of antiviral drug arbidol on cytokine storm and pulmonary fibrosis Here, we use a mouse model of bleomycininduced pulmonary fibrosis and a mouse model of fecal dilutioninduced sepsis to evaluate the effects of arbidol on pulmonary fibrosis and cytokine storm The results showed that arbidol significantly reduced the area of pulmonary fibrosis and improved lung function reduced inspiratory resistance, lung dynamic compliance and forced vital capacity increased Treatment with arbidol promoted reduced sepsis severity 48xa0h after sepsis induction, based on weight, murine sepsis score and survival rate Arbidol observably alleviates inflammatory infiltrates and injury in the lungs and liver Finally, we also found that arbidol reduced serum levels of proinflammatory factors such as TNFα and IL6 induced by fecal dilution In conclusion, our results indicate that arbidol can alleviate the severity of pulmonary fibrosis and sepsis, and provide some reference for the treatment of cytokine storm and sequelae of pulmonary fibrosis in patients with COVID19,,,Graphical abstract,,,As countries continue to industrialize, major cities experience diminished air quality, while rural populations also experience poor air quality from sources such as agricultural operations These exposures to environmental pollution from both rural and populatedindustrialized sources have adverse effects on human health Although respiratory diseases eg asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are the most commonly reported following longterm exposure to particulate matter and hazardous chemicals, gastrointestinal complications have also been associated with the increased risk of lung disease from inhalation of polluted air The interconnectedness of these organ systems has offered valuable insights into the roles of the immune system and the micromycobiota as mediators of communication between the lung and the gut during disease states A topical example of this relationship is provided by reports of multiple gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19, while the rapid transmission and increased risk of COVID19 has been linked to poor air quality and high levels of particulate matter In this review, we focus on the mechanistic effects of environmental pollution on disease progression with special emphasis on the gutlung axis,Arterial and venous thromboembolism are both more common in older adults The use of anticoagulants, the mainstay to prevent thromboembolism, requires consideration of the balance between risk and benefit Such consideration is even more important in the very elderly in whom the risk of anticoagulantrelated bleeding and thrombosis are higher This review will focus on the challenges of implementing and managing anticoagulant therapy in older patients in an era when the options for anticoagulants include not only vitamin K antagonists VKAs, but also directacting oral anticoagulants DOACs,The patients with COVID‐19 pneumonia who suffer from worsening of the clinical respiratory symptoms, after the beginning of the treatment, should be evaluated for pulmonary embolism using CT angiography if there are no contraindications The patients with COVID‐19 pneumonia who suffer from worsening of the clinical respiratory symptoms, after the beginning of the treatment, should be evaluated for pulmonary embolism using CT angiography if there are no contraindications,This review summarizes key imaging studies that were presented at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions 2020, which occurred virtually this year due to the pandemic, related to the fields of singlephoton emission computed tomography, positron emission tomography, cardiac computed tomography, cardiac magnetic resonance, and echocardiography The aim of this birds eye view is to inform readers of the various studies discussed at the meeting from these imaging modalities Since there was no physical attendance this year, we find that a general overview of imaging will be especially useful Further, we hope that the presentation of multiple imaging studies in a single synthesized review will stimulate new ideas for future research in imaging,,CART transfer, recently welldeveloped immunotherapy, has offered substantial benefit to more and more patients with advanced cancers However, along with growing experience in the clinical application comes the increasing awareness of the potentially fatal adverse effects, most notably cytokine release syndrome CRS and neurotoxicity Understanding the mechanisms underlying these toxicities can help to improve therapeutic outcomes Recent findings highlight the importance of monocytemacrophage in CARTrelated toxicities CARTOX and shed light on a novel mechanism mediated by damageassociated molecular patterns DAMPs released from pyroptotic cells Therefore, this review summarizes these findings and provides practical guidance to the management of CARTOX,Our aim is to present the importance of mobile Handheld Lung Ultrasound HLUS in COVID19 patients at the bedside, which is a prescreening tool with high diagnostic value that can provide triage of symptomatic patients at home prehospital, emergency services, Intensive Care Units ICU In this context, the current role and importance of HLUS at the bedside in COVID19 pneumonia has been summarized,In the presented clinical review, we evaluated the possibilities of drug and nondrug strategies for eliminating and preventing pathophysiological changes in the respiratory system of postCOVID19 patients We offer uptodate rehabilitation algorithms based on the assessment of the severity of clinical manifestations of COVID19, the possibilities of rehabilitation techniques and the patients personal compliance with their implementation,In 2020, new guidelines have been published by the European Society of Cardiology including those on nonSTsegment elevation acute coronary syndromes, atrial fibrillation and adult congenital heart disease Regarding interventional cardiology, POPular TAVI opens the possibility of antiplatelet monotherapy after transcutaneous aortic valve replacement EMPERORReduced confirms the importance of SGLT2 inhibitors in the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction Within the field of imaging, stress MRI has now become the firstline technique for the screening of coronary artery disease, demonstrating an excellent costbenefit ratio Finally, reninangiotensinaldosterone inhibitors do not appear to increase the risk of an infection by COVID19,,,OBJECTIVES A link between stress and Crohns disease activity suggests an association, but results have been conflicting The purpose of this study was to assess whether the stress related to the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic affected disease activity in patients with Crohns disease BASIC METHODS An anonymous survey was distributed to patients through gastroenterology clinics and networks Patients were asked to report their Crohns disease symptoms in the months prior to the COVID19 pandemic and again during the early stages of the COVID19 pandemic using the Manitoba inflammatory bowel disease index in addition to questions about stress, perception of reasons for symptom change and personal impact MAIN RESULTS Out of 243 individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of Crohns disease, there was a 24 relative increase in active symptoms between the preCOVID19 period to the duringCOVID19 period P  00001 reflecting an absolute change from 45 to 56, respectively The most frequent reported reason for a change in symptoms was Increased stressand or feeling overwhelmed 118236, and personal impact of the pandemic was, Im worrying a lot about the future 113236, both reported by approximately half of respondents PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS This study serves as a proof of concept demonstrating the impact of a significant and uniquely uniform stressor as a natural experiment on Crohns disease activity The severity of symptoms of Crohns disease increased during the COVID19 pandemic The primary reported reason for symptom change was an increase in stress, not a change in diet, exercise or other lifestyle behaviours, corroborating the hypothesis that stress affects Crohns disease activity,We report the case of a patient implanted with an implantable defibrillator endowed with a multisensor algorithm for heart failure monitoring Automatic measurement of multiple clinical variables allowed to detect impending heart failure decompensation and showed its ability to facilitate differential diagnosis in the context of the current COVID‐19 pandemic Implantable cardioverter‐defibrillators continuously monitor multiple physiological variables to identify patients at risk of HF Monitoring of multiple clinical variables may also facilitate screening, triage, and differential diagnosis in the context of the COVID‐19 pandemic,Abstract  Rationale The preliminary reports of COVID Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome COVIDARDS suggest the existence of a subset of patients with higher lung compliance despite profound hypoxemia Understanding heterogeneity seen in patients with COVIDARDS and comparing to nonCOVIDARDS may inform tailored treatments   Objectives To describe the trajectories of hypoxemia and respiratory compliance in COVIDARDS and associations with outcomes   Methods A multidisciplinary team of frontline clinicians and data scientists created the Northwell COVIDARDS dataset NorthCARDS leveraging over 11,542 COVID19 hospital admissions Data was summarized to describe differences based on clinically meaningful categories of lung compliance, and compared to nonCOVIDARDS reports A sophisticated method of extrapolating PaO2 from SpO2, as well estimating FiO2 from non invasive oxygen delivery devices were utilized to create meaningful trends of derived PaO2 to FiO2 PF   Measurements and Main Results Of the 1595 COVIDARDS patients in the NorthCARDS dataset, there were 538 34·6 who had very low lung compliance 20mlcmH2O, 982 63·2 with lownormal compliance 2050mlcmH2O, and 34 2·2 with high lung compliance 50mlcmH2O The very low compliance group had double the median time to intubation compared to the lownormal group 107 hoursIQR 26·3, 238·3 vs 37·9 hoursIQR 4·8, 90·7 Oxygenation trends have improved in all groups after a nadir immediately post intubation The PF ratio improved from a mean of 109 to 155, with the very low compliance group showing a smaller improvement compared to low compliance group The derived PF trends closely correlated with blood gas analysis driven PF trends, except immediately post intubation were the trends diverge as illustrated in the image Overall, 67·5 n1049 of the patients died during the hospitalization In comparison to nonCOVIDARDS reports, there were less patients in the high compliance category 22vs12, compliance 50mLcmH20, and more patients with PF  150 57·8 vs 456 No correlation was apparent between lung compliance and PF ratio The Oxygenation Index was similar, 11·12SD 5·67vs12·8SD 10·8   Conclusions Heterogeneity in lung compliance is seen in COVIDARDS, without apparent correlation to degree of hypoxemia Notably, time to intubation was greater in the very low lung compliance category Understanding ARDS patient heterogeneity must include consideration of treatment patterns in addition to trajectories of change in patientlevel data and demographics,First recognized in 1990, takotsubo syndrome TTS constitutes an acute cardiac condition that mimics acute myocardial infarction commonly in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease it is characterized by temporary left ventricular dysfunction, regularly in a circumferential apical, midventricular, or basal distribution Considering its acute clinical presentation, coronary angiography with left ventriculography constitutes the gold standard diagnostic tool to exclude or confirm TTS Frequently, TTS is related to severe emotional or physical stress and a subsequent increased adrenergic stimulation affecting cardiac function Beyond clinical presentation, epidemiology, and novel diagnostic biomarkers, this review draws attention to potential pathophysiological mechanisms for the observed reversible myocardial dysfunction such as sympathetic overdrivemediated multivessel epicardial spasms, microvascular dysfunction, the direct toxicity of catecholamines, lipotoxicity, and inflammation Considering the longterm prognosis, further experimental and clinical research is indispensable to elucidate further pathophysiological mechanisms underlying TTS before randomized control trials with evidencebased therapeutic management can be performed,Arterial hypertension is axa0real global burden with axa0very high prevalence In the last decades, many pharmaceutical approaches have been successfully developed for treating hypertension Currently, novel medications for influencing blood pressure are not in sight In recent years alternatives, such as interventional procedures for reducing blood pressure, have been developed and tested Ablation of the renal sympathetic nerves renal denervation, RDN, which are wrapped around the renal arteries in particular, has been intensively investigated as a procedure After the first RDN studies a clear influence on the blood pressure could be shown however, in the first shamcontrolled studies the reduction in blood pressure by RDN could no longer consistently be shown In very systematic shamcontrolled, blinded studies in patients with hypertension but without medication axa0robust blood pressure reducing effect of RDN could be shown, which corresponded to the effect of a blood pressurereducing drug It is obvious that larger studies and also longterm studies have to sustainably confirm this effect In recent years, active and passive stimulation of the baroreceptors could also be established as a blood pressure reducing principle, at least in studies but the evidence is still very low,Obstructive airway diseases, eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD and asthma, represent leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide However, the efficacy of currently available inhaled therapeutics is not sufficient for arresting disease progression and decreasing mortality, hence providing an urgent need for development of novel therapeutics Local delivery to the airways via inhalation is promising for novel drugs, because it allows for delivery directly to the target site of action and minimizes systemic drug exposure In addition, novel drug modalities like RNA therapeutics provide entirely new opportunities for highly specific treatment of airway diseases Here, we review state of the art of conventional inhaled drugs used for the treatment of COPD and asthma with focus on quality attributes of inhaled medicines, and we outline the therapeutic potential and safety of novel drugs Subsequently, we present recent advances in manufacturing of thermostable solid dosage forms for pulmonary administration, important quality attributes of inhalable dry powder formulations, and obstacles for the translation of inhalable solid dosage forms to the clinic Delivery challenges for inhaled RNA therapeutics and delivery technologies used to overcome them are also discussed Finally, we present future prospects of novel inhaled RNAbased therapeutics for treatment of obstructive airways diseases, and highlight major knowledge gaps, which require further investigation to advance RNAbased medicine towards the bedside,Hemoglobin DPunjab is the most common variant of hemoglobin D In premarital screening, molecular testing is often unavailable, and diagnosis and marriage guidance often relies on the hemoglobin analysis, family studies and epidemiological facts The use of latter methods sometimes results in hemoglobin DPunjabβthalassemia double heterozygote being mistaken for its homozygote, which could be costly We present the clinical and laboratory characteristics of hemoglobin DPunjab phenotypesgenotypes in 15 individuals and review similar reports in the literature We find that the quantity of hemoglobin DPunjab in homozygotes is higher than in hemoglobin DPunjabβthalassemia double heterozygotes, its fraction  92 being consistent with homozygosis The limitations of this diagnostic criterion are discussed, and clinical severity of this and other hemoglobin DPunjab double heterozygotes reviewed,The severe respiratory and systemic disease named coronavirus disease2019 COVID19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 Currently, the COVID19 pandemic presents a huge social and health challenge worldwide Many different risk factors are associated with disease severity, such as systemic arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, older age, and other coinfections Other respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD and smoking are common comorbidities worldwide Previous investigations have identified among COVID19 patients smokers and COPD patients, but recent investigations have questioned the higher risk among these populations Nevertheless, previous reports failed to isolate smokers and COPD patients without other comorbidities We performed a longitudinal evaluation of the disease course of smokers, former smokers, and COPD patients with COVID19 without other comorbidities, from hospitalization to hospital discharge Although no difference between groups was observed during hospital admission, smokers and COPD patients presented an increase in COVID19associated inflammatory markers during the disease course in comparison to nonsmokers and former smokers Our results demonstrated that smoking and COPD are risk factors for severe COVID19 with possible implications for the ongoing pandemic,There have been nearly 70 million cases of COVID19 worldwide, with over 15 million deaths at the time of this publication This global pandemic has mandated dramatic changes in healthcare delivery with a particular focus on social distancing in order to reduce viral transmission Heart failure patients are among the highest utilizers of health care and are at increased risk for COVIDrelated vulnerabilities Effectively managing this complex and resourceintensive patient population from a distance presents new and unique challenges Here, we review relevant data on telemedicine and remote monitoring strategies for heart failure patients and provide a framework to help providers treat this population during the COVID19 pandemic This includes i dedicated previsit contact and planning ie confirm clinical appropriateness, presence of compatible technology, and patient comfort ii utilization of virtual clinic visits use of telehealth platforms, a videoassisted exam, selfreported vital signs, and weights and iii use of existing remote heart failure monitoring sensors when applicable CardioMEMS, Optivol, and HeartLogic While telemedicine and remote monitoring strategies are not new, these technologies are emerging as an important tool for the effective management of heart failure patients during the COVID19 pandemic In general, these strategies appear to be safe however, additional data will be needed to determine their effectiveness with respect to both process and outcomes measures,Literature has been published stating that thrombosis is occurring at higher rates in patients who are positive for COVID19 This experience is more with limb ischemia Reports of mesenteric ischemia are coming in from different parts of the globe We share our early experience of managing two patients with acute mesenteric ischemia,The global COVID19 pandemic has prompted urgent need for potential therapies for severe respiratory consequences resulting from coronavirus infection New therapeutic agents that will attenuate ongoing inflammation and at the same time promote regeneration of injured lung epithelial cells are urgently needed Cellbased therapies, primarily involving mesenchymal stromal cells MSCs and their derivatives, are currently investigated worldwide for SARSCoV2induced lung diseases A significant number of academic centers and companies globally have already initiated such trials However, at a time of unprecedented need, it is also foreseen that families and caregivers will seek all available options, including access to cellbased and other investigational products, even before proven safety and efficacy as well as regulatory approval This should not be an excuse for opportunists to sell or advertise unproven therapies of any kind Compassionate use should be conducted in the context of a clinical investigation framed by strict ethical and regulatory permissions, with the goal of obtaining mechanistic information wherever possible,Reports of different types of neurological manifestations of COVID19 are rapidly increasing, including changes of posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome PRES Here we describe the first reported case of COVID19 and PRES in Australia diagnosed on basis of MRI brain imaging and confirmed clinically by presence of confusion, delirium, headaches, also associated with hypertension and blood pressure variability and stable longterm kidney problems He made full recovery as his blood pressure was controlled and clinical status was supported with appropriate supportive therapy Although traditionally a rare condition, PRES is likely to be more common among patients with COVID19 pathobiology there is Renin downregulation of ACE2 receptors, involvement of ReninAngiotensinAldosterone system, endotheliitis, cytokine storm, and hyperimmune response Thus we advocate clinical suspicion and early brain imaging with MRI brain among vulnerable patients with known comorbidities, and diagnosed with COVID19 given that hypertension and blood pressure variability are often exacerbated by acute SARSCoV2 immune reactions Such acute hypertensive encephalopathy was able to be reversed with timely supportive therapy ensuring rehydration and reestablishment of blood pressure control,BackgroundFutile resuscitation for outofhospital cardiac arrest OHCA patients in the coronavirus disease COVID19 era can lead to risk of disease transmission and unnecessary transport Various existing basic or advanced life support BLS or ALS, respectively rules for the termination of resuscitation TOR have been derived and validated in North America and Asian countries This study aimed to evaluate the external validation of these rules in predicting the survival outcomes of OHCA patients in the COVID19 eraMethodsThis was a multicenter observational study using the WinCOVID19 Daegu registry data collected during February 18March 31, 2020 The subjects were patients who showed cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac etiology The outcomes of each rule were compared to the actual patient survival outcomes The sensitivity, specificity, false positive value FPV, and positive predictive value PPV of each TOR rule were evaluatedResultsIn total, 170 of the 184 OHCA patients were eligible and evaluated TOR was recommended for 122 patients based on the international basic life support termination of resuscitation BLSTOR rule, which showed 85 specificity, 74 sensitivity, 08 FPV, and 99 PPV for predicting unfavorable survival outcomes When the traditional BLSTOR rules and KoCARC TOR rule II were applied to our registry, one patient met the TOR criteria but survived at hospital discharge With regard to the FPV upper limit of 95 confidence intervalu2009u200999 criteria, only the KoCARC TOR rule I, which included a combination of three factors including not being witnessed by emergency medical technicians, presenting with an asystole at the scene, and not experiencing prehospital shock delivery or return of spontaneous circulation, was found to be superior to all other TOR rulesConclusionAmong the previous nine BLS and ALS TOR rules, KoCARC TOR rule I was most suitable for predicting poor survival outcomes and showed improved diagnostic performance Further research on variations in resources and treatment protocols among facilities, regions, and cultures will be useful in determining the feasibility of TOR rules for COVID19 patients worldwide,OBJECTIVES Coronavirus disease 19 COVID19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2, is associated with diverse clinical, including hematologic, abnormalities We describe peripheral blood and bone marrow findings in deceased and living patients with COVID19 METHODS We examined bone marrows from 20 autopsies and 2 living patients with COVID19 using HEstained slides and immunohistochemical stains Clinical history and laboratory values were reviewed HScore was calculated to estimate risk of hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis HLH RESULTS The deceased patients included 12 men and 8 women aged 32 to 89 years median, 63 years Hematologic abnormalities included frequent neutrophilic leukocytosis, lymphopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia one patient showed striking erythrocytosis The bone marrows were all normocellular to hypercellular, most showing maturing trilineage hematopoiesis with myeloid left shift In all 19 evaluable bone marrows, hemophagocytic histiocytes were identified The HScore for secondary HLH ranged from 35 to 269 median, 125 169 in 5 patients Coinfections were identified in 6 patients In 2 living patients, bone marrow showed maturing trilineage hematopoiesis, including one showing few hemophagocytic histiocytes CONCLUSIONS Peripheral blood from deceased patients with COVID19 frequently showed neutrophilic leukocytosis, lymphopenia, and, rarely, secondary polycythemia hemophagocytosis was common in their bone marrow Consistent with other studies, we provide histopathologic evidence of secondary HLH development in patients with COVID19,,BackgroundThe global pandemic COVID19 caused by the new coronavirus SARSCoV2 has already caused about 14 million deaths, and to date, there are no effective or direct antiviral vaccines Some vaccines are in the last stages of testing Overall mortality rates vary between countries, for example, from a minimum of 005 in Singapore to a maximum of 975 in Mexico however, mortality and severity of COVID19 are higher in the elderly and in those with comorbidities already present such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart diseaseMain textRecent evidence has shown that an underlying liver disease can also be a risk factor, and SARSCoV2 itself can cause direct or indirect damage to liver tissue through multisystem inflammation generated especially in the more severe stages In the current pandemic, liver dysfunction has been observed in 1453 of patients with severe COVID19 In addition, drugs administered during infection may be an additional factor of liver damage The mechanism of cellular penetration of the virus that occurs by viral entry is through the receptors of the angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme ACE2 host that are abundantly present in type II pneumocytes, heart cells, but also liver cholangiocytesConclusionIn this manuscript, we describe the clinical management aimed at preserving the liver or reducing the damage caused by COVID19 and antiCOVID19 drug treatments,Rationale Patients with and without cardiovascular diseases have been shown to be at risk of influenzamediated cardiac complications Recent clinical reports support the notion of a direct link between laboratoryconfirmed influenza virus infections and adverse cardiac events Objective Define the molecular mechanisms underlying influenza virusinduced cardiac pathogenesis after resolution of pulmonary infection and the role of necroptosis in this processMethods and Results Hearts from wildtype and necroptosis deficient MLKLKO mice were dissected twelve days after initial Influenza A virus IAV infection when viral titers were undetectable in the lungs Immunofluorescence microscopy and plaque assays showed presence of viable IAV particles in the myocardium without generation of interferon responses Global proteome and phosphoproteome analyses using high resolution accurate mass based LCMSMS and labelfree quantitation showed that the global proteome as well as the phosphoproteome profiles were significantly altered in IAVinfected mouse hearts in a strain independent manner Necroptosis deficient mice had increased survival and reduced weight loss postIAV infection, as well as increased antioxidant and mitochondrial function, indicating partial protection to IAV infection These findings were confirmed in vitro by pretreatment of human and rat myocytes with antioxidants or necroptosis inhibitors, which blunted oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage after IAV infection Conclusions This study provides the first evidence that the cardiac proteome and phosphoproteome are significantly altered post pulmonary influenza infection Moreover, viral particles can persist in the heart after lung clearance, altering mitochondrial function and promoting cell death without active replication and interferon responses Finally, our findings show inhibition of necroptosis or prevention of mitochondrial damage as possible therapeutic interventions to reduce cardiac damage during influenza infections,With alternatives such as gene profiling available for surveillance after orthotopic heart transplantation, we sought to evaluate the utilization of endomyocardial biopsies EMBs for hospitalized patients after heart transplantation Surveillance EMBs in patients with and without complications were evaluated from the 2004 to 2014 National Inpatient Sample Over the study period, there was no significant change in the number of EMB procedures performed P  044 Of 37,955 EMBs, 2283 6 were in the setting of graft complications, while 35,672 EMBs were not related to graft complications EMBs in graft complications did not show a significant increase in length of stay over time P  006, but had a significant increase in cost over time P  0001 However, those with graft complications had an average of a 5day longer length of stay P  0001 and costs that were 88,816 P  0001 more expensive compared with those without graft complications In conclusion, the vast majority of inhospital EMBs were not related to heart transplantation complications Nevertheless, EMB hospitalizations with graft complications showed significantly greater length of stay and cost With the COVID19 pandemic, it seems more effective to use minimalcontact health surveillance methods rather than invasive EMBs,Background 828 of patients infected with COVID19 have evidence of cardiac injury, and this is associated with an adverse prognosis The cardiovascular mechanisms of injury are poorly understood and speculative We aim to use multimodality cardiac imaging including cardiac magnetic resonance CMR imaging, computed tomography coronary angiography CTCA and positron emission tomography with 2deoxy2fluorine18fluoro Dglucose integrated with computed tomography 18FFDGPETCT to identify the cardiac pathophysiological mechanisms related to COVID19 infectionsMethods This is a singlecentre exploratory observational study aiming to recruit 50 patients with COVID19 infection who will undergo cardiac biomarker sampling Of these, 30 patients will undergo combined CTCA  18FFDGPETCT, followed by CMR Prevalence ofxa0obstructive and nonobstructive atherosclerotic coronary disease will be assessed using CTCA CMR will be used to identify and characterise myocardial disease including presence of cardiac dysfunction, myocardial fibrosis, myocardial oedema and myocardial infarction 18FFDGPETCT will identify vascular and cardiac inflammation Primary endpoint will be the presence of cardiovascular pathology and the association with troponin levels Discussion The results of the study will identify the presence and modality of cardiac injury associated COVID19 infection, and the utility of multimodality imaging in diagnosing such injury This will further inform clinical decision making during the pandemic TRIAL REGISTRATIONxa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0xa0 This study has been retrospectively registered at the ISRCTN registry ID ISRCTN12154994 on 14th August 2020 Accessible at wwwisrctncomISRCTN12154994,Emerging evidence hints in favor of a lifethreatening link between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 SARSCoV2 and the cardiovascular system SARSCoV2 may result in dramatic cardiovascular complications, whereas the severity of COronaVIrus Disease 2019 COVID19 and the incidence of fatalities tend to increase in patients with preexisting cardiovascular complications SARSCoV2 is internalized into the host cells by endocytosis and may then escape the endolysosomal system via endosomes Twopore channels drive endolysosomal trafficking through the release of endolysosomal Ca2 Recent evidence suggested that the pharmacological inhibition of TPCs prevents Ebola virus and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome COronaVirus MERSCoV entry into host cells In this perspective, we briefly summarize the biophysical and pharmacological features of TPCs, illustrate their emerging role in the cardiovascular system, and finally present them as a reliable target to treat cardiovascular complications in COVID19 patients,,Traditionally, the management of patients with pulmonary embolism has been accomplished with anticoagulant treatment with parenteral heparins and oral vitamin K antagonists Although the administration of heparins and oral vitamin K antagonists still plays a role in pulmonary embolism management, the use of these therapies are limited due to other options now available This is due to their toxicity profile, clearance limitations, and many interactions with other medications and nutrients The emergence of direct oral anticoagulation therapies has led to more options now being available to manage pulmonary embolism in inpatient and outpatient settings conveniently These oral therapeutic options have opened up opportunities for safe and effective pulmonary embolism management, as more evidence and research is now available about reversal agents and monitoring parameters The evolution of the pharmacological management of pulmonary embolism has provided us with better understanding regarding the selection of anticoagulants There is also a better understanding and employment of anticoagulants in pulmonary embolism in special populations, such as patients with liver failure, renal failure, malignancy, and COVID19,An amendment to this paper has been published and can be accessed via the original article,,Abstract  Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD is associated with increased risk of severe COVID19, but the mechanisms are unclear Besides, patients with severe COVID19 have been reported to have increased levels of several immune mediators   Objective To perform an immunoproteomic profiling of dysregulated plasma proteins in patients with asthma and COPD and to evaluate their relationship with biomarkers of severe COVID19   Methods Ninetytwo proteins were quantified in 315 plasma samples from adult subjects age 4090 years including 118 asthmatics, 99 COPD patients and 98 healthy controls, that have been recruited in two reference pneumology clinics in Colombia before the beginning of the COVID19 pandemic Protein levels were compared between each disease group and healthy controls Significant proteins were compared to the gene signatures of SARSCoV2 infection reported in the COVID19 Drug and Gene Set Library and with known protein biomarkers of severe COVID19   Results Fortyone plasma proteins showed differences between patients and controls Asthmatic patients have increased levels in IL6 while COPD patients have a broader systemic inflammatory dysregulation driven by HGF, OPG, and several chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, CX3CL1, CXCL1, MCP3, MCP4, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL11 These proteins are involved in chemokine signaling pathways related with response to viral infections and some, were found upregulated upon SARSCoV2 experimental infection of Calu3 cells as reported in the COVID19 Related Gene Sets database An increase of HPG, CXCL9, CXCL10, IL6, MCP3, TNF and ENRAGE has also been found in patients with severe COVID19   Conclusions COPD patients have altered levels of plasma proteins that have been reported increased in patients with severe COVID19 Our study suggests that COPD patients have a systemic dysregulation in chemokine networks including HGF and CXCL9 that could make them more susceptible to severe COVID19 Our study also suggest that IL6 levels are increased in some asthmatics and this may influence their immune response to COVID19,The current uncontrollable outbreak of novel coronavirus COVID19 has unleashed severe global consequences in all aspects of life and society, bringing the whole world to a complete halt and has modeled significant threats to the global economy The COVID19 infection manifests with flulike symptoms such as cough, cold, and fever resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS, lung dysfunction, and other systemic complications in critical patients are creating panic across the globe However, the licensed vaccine has started to show up some resulted in side effects that would limit its possibility in some circumstances as allergic personnel, for example Moreover, the production and approval of new drugs is a very complicated process and takes a long time On the other hand, stem cells have gone the extra mile and intensively investigated at preclinical and clinical studies in various degenerative diseases, including infectious ones Stem cells are proposed as a broadspectrum therapeutic agent, which may suppress the exaggerated immune response and promote endogenous repair by enhancing COVID19 infected lung microenvironment Also, stem cells have different application manners, either direct transplantation, exosome transplantation, or drug delivery of specific cytokines or nanoparticles with antiviral property by engineering stem cells This review discusses and summarizes the possible emerging role of cellbased therapy, especially stem cell therapy, as an alternative promising therapeutic option for the treatment and control of novel COVID19 and its potential role in tissue rejuvenation after COVID19 infection,,Shielding during the coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the potential of routinely collected primary care records to identify patients with highrisk conditions, including severe asthma We aimed to determine how previous studies have used primary care records to identify and investigate severe asthma and whether linkage to other data sources is required to fully investigate this highrisk disease variant A scoping review was conducted based on the Arksey and OMalley framework Twelve studies met all criteria for inclusion We identified variation in how studies defined the background asthma cohort, asthma severity, control and clinical outcomes Certain asthma outcomes could only be investigated through linkage to secondary care records The ability of primary care records to represent the entire known asthma population is unique However, a number of challenges need to be overcome if their full potential to accurately identify and investigate severe asthma is to be realised,Obstructive sleep apnea OSA, the most prevalent form of sleeprelated breathing disorder SRBD, is associated with cardiovascular, neurocognitive, and metabolic complications Evidence suggests that these comorbidities are also risk factors for enhanced severity in COVID19 patients Hence, initial diagnosis or screening of OSArisk is a major requirement of current times, which can be fulfilled by a noncommercial, easily accessible mobile application for selfassessment of OSArisk The current article mentions a prototype of an OSARisk Assessment Tool, a mobile application developed after prior testing of needs analysis and comprising various interfaces for OSArisk assessment in all age groups, and further refined for user applicability through a cognitive, pluralistic walkthrough and heuristic evaluation by the authors and four volunteers It has huge scope of application in orthodontic clinics, primary healthcare centers in middle and lowincome strata of developing countries, and multiple educational and licensing institutions for the larger benefit of the society,Background Thousands of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID19 patients have been discharged from hospitals, persistent followup studies are required to evaluate the prevalence of postCOVID19 fibrosisMethods This study involves 462 laboratory confirmed patients with COVID19 who were admitted to Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital from January 11, 2020 to April 26, 2020 A total of 457 patients underwent thinsection chest CT scans during the hospitalization or after discharge to identify the pulmonary lesion A total of 287 patients were followed up from 90 days to 150 days after the onset of the disease, and lung function tests were conducted in about three months after the onset The risk factors affecting the persistence of pulmonary fibrosis were identified through regression analysis and the prediction model of the persistence of pulmonary fibrosis was establishedResultsxa0xa0Parenchymal bands, irregular interfaces, reticulation and traction bronchiectasis were the most common CT features in all COVID19 patients During the 030, 3160, 6190, 91120 and 120 days after onset, 8687, 7440, 7956, 6812 and 6203 patients developed with pulmonary fibrosis and 453, 1961, 1802, 3830 and 4898 patients reversed pulmonary fibrosis, respectively It was observed that Age, BMI, Fever, and Highest PCT were predictive factors for sustaining fibrosis even after 90 days from onset A predictive model of the persistence with pulmonary fibrosis was developed basedon the Logistic Regression method with an accuracy, PPV, NPV, Sensitivity and Specificity of the model of 76, 71, 79, 67, and 82, respectively More than half of COVID19 patients revealed abnormal condition in lung function after 90 days from onset, and the ratio of abnormal lung function did not differ on a statistically significant level between the fibrotic and nonfibrotic groupsConclusions Persistent pulmonary fibrosis was more likely to develop in patients with older age, high BMI, severecritical condition, fever, long time to turn the viral RNA negative, preexisting disease and delay to admission Fibrosis developed in COVID19 patients could be reversed in about a third of the patients after 120 days from onset The pulmonary function of less than half of COVID19 patients could turn to normal condition after three months from onset An effective prediction model with an average Area Under the Curve AUC of 084 was established to predict the persistence of pulmonary fibrosis in COVID19 patients for early diagnosis,,Abstract  Background Hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin was one of the common therapies at the beginning of the COVID19 pandemic They can prolong QT interval, cause Torsade de pointes, and lead to sudden cardiac death We aimed to assess QT interval prolongation and its risk factors in patients who received hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin   Methods This was a retrospective cohort study 172 patients with COVID19 included, hospitalized at hospitals of Babol University of Medical Sciences between March 5, 2020, and April 3, 2020 Patients were divided into two groups hydroxychloroquine alone and hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin Electrocardiograms were used for outcome assessment   Results  831 of patients received hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin vs 169 of patients who received only hydroxychloroquine The mean age of patients was 592  154 The mean of posttreatment QTc interval in the monotherapy group was shorter than the mean of posttreatment QTc interval in the combination therapy group but it had no significant statistical difference 4625  431 milliseconds vs 4643  591 milliseconds P  0488 Generally, 221 of patients had a prolonged QTc interval after treatment Male gender, or baseline QTc  450 milliseconds, or highrisk Tisdale score increased the likelihood of prolonged QTc interval Due to QTc prolongation, 14 patients did not continue therapy after 4 days    Conclusion Hospitalized patients treated with hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin, had no significant difference in prolongation of QT interval and outcome But the number of patients with prolonged QT intervals in this study emphasizes careful cardiac monitoring during therapy especially in highrisk patients,PurposeLaryngotracheal stenosis describes various airflow compromising conditions leading to laryngeal and tracheal narrowing, including subglottic and tracheal stenosis Direct laryngobronchoscopy is the diagnostic gold standard for laryngotracheal stenosis This study aimed to explore the effect of inhaled fluticasone propionate as adjuvant medical therapy in patients with laryngotracheal stenosis after balloon dilation MethodsThis prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted from April 2019 to April 2020 Fourteen adults u200918xa0years with laryngotracheal stenosis consented to participate All patients underwent endoscopic balloon dilation Seven patients were treated with inhaled fluticasone propionate, and seven acted as controls Detailed documentation of operative findings and pre and postballoon dilation spirometry measurements were recorded Basic demographic data and operative details, including information about the percentage of laryngotracheal stenosis, distance of laryngotracheal stenosis from the vocal cords, the stenotic segment vertical length, and the largest endotracheal tube used before and after dilation were noted ResultsSpirometry measurements were obtained on 34 occasions 17 before and 17 after balloon dilation The two groups were similar in spirometry values after treatment Both groups had significantly improved on most spirometry values after balloon dilationConclusionWe found that using inhaled steroids after balloon dilatation in patients with laryngotracheal stenosis had no benefit over nonuser patients in spirometry parameters during the short postoperative followup To confirm this outcome, we recommend a largescale doubleblind study with a longer followup period,This report supports the feasibility of pulmonary thromboendarterectomy in thalassemic patients, and highlights the need for a comprehensive evaluation of the cause of pulmonary hypertension prior to determining the likelihood of surgical cure This report supports the feasibility of pulmonary thromboendarterectomy in thalassemic patients, and highlights the need for a comprehensive evaluation of the cause of pulmonary hypertension prior to determining the likelihood of surgical cure,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 infection was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020 Initially, infected patients presented with fever, nonproductive cough, dyspnea, myalgia, shortness of breath, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia However, others presented with atypical cardiac manifestation As this disease is new, the full picture of the disease presentation is not fully understood Since December 2019, many morbidities related to coronavirus disease2019 COVID19 were documented, including vascular complications like venous thromboembolism VTE, pulmonary embolism PE, and deep vein thrombosis DVT in acutely ill COVID19 patients Hereby, we are writing a case of a patient with COVID19 infection suffering from newonset atrial fibrillation AF It was complicated by multiple arterial embolisms involving different organs despite the use of an intermediate dose of lowmolecularweight heparin LMWH, and the patient was eventually discharged home on a directacting oral anticoagulant DOAC,,Introduction The novel coronavirus disease has disrupted blood transfusion services worldwide Despite blood transfusion services taking several precautionary measures to minimize the risks of COVID19 during blood donations, donors became anxious regarding the risk of the COVID19 infection during the donation and the blood transfusion services was facing the inevitable hazard of blood shortage Methods The study was conducted at a tertiary care oncology hospitalbased blood transfusion services and included analysis of blood donations, packed red blood cell units requirements, and packed red blood cell inventory in the pre lockdown and lockdown phase New COVID19 standard operating procedures with enhanced safety guidelines and donor confidencebuilding measures were implemented at the blood transfusion services Results The total number of average monthly blood donations decreased in lockdown but the decrease was not statistically significant 2385 vs 1978, Pu202fu202f0391 The requisitions for the packed red blood cell crossmatches 7225 vs 3290, Pu202fu202f0001 and the packed red blood cell utilization 1765 vs 1033, Pu202fu202f0028 for the hospital patients also decreased significantly due to the lockdown In the lockdown phase, an expressive number of packed red blood cell units were outdated due to the unprecedented fall in the number of patients In the postlockdown phase, the packed red blood cell inventory was optimized with decreased outdating via a comprehensive approach A special emphasis was given to the inhouse donations A second partial lockdown also decreased the blood donations Conclusion Confidencebuilding in blood donors and the resolution of logistical issues were crucial for the efficient packed red blood cell inventory management in the lockdown Implementation of COVID19 preventive measures helped in the blood donor and blood transfusion services staff safety,AIMS Patients with advanced heart failure HF with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction HFrEF and concurrent coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 might have a higher risk of severe events METHODS AND RESULTS We retrospectively studied 16 patients with advanced HFrEF who developed COVID19 between 1 March and 29 May 2020 Followup lasted until 30 September Ten patients previously hospitalized with decompensated HFrEF were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 during hospitalization Six patients undergoing ambulatory care at initiation of COVID19 symptoms were hospitalized because of advanced HFrEF All patients who experienced worsening of HFrEF due to COVID19 required higher doses or introduction of additional inotropic drugs or intraaortic balloon pump in the intensive care unit The mean intravenous dobutamine dose before SARSCoV2 infection in previously hospitalized patients nxa0xa010 and the median interquartile range peak intravenous dobutamine dose during SARSCoV2 infection in all patients nxa0xa016 were 2 07 μgkgmin and 20 1420 P,AIMS Remote patient monitoring RPM in the management of heart failure HF, including telemonitoring, thoracic impedance, implantable pulmonary artery pressure PAP monitors, and cardiac implantable electronic device CIEDbased sensors, has had varying outcomes in single platform studies Uncertainty remains regarding the development of singlecentre RPM programs additionally, no studies examine the effectiveness of dual platform RPM programs for HF This study describes the implementation and outcomes of a dual platform RPM program for HF at a single centre METHODS AND RESULTS An RPM program was developed to include two platforms eg CardioMEMS™ HF System and HeartLogic™ HF Diagnostic To examine changes within each participant over time, studyrelated outcomes including total hospitalizations TH, total length of stay TLOS, cardiac hospitalizations CH, cardiac LOS CLOS, and cardiacrelated emergency department ED visits were compared in two timeframes 12xa0months preenrolment and postenrolment into RPM For 141 participants enrolled, there was a significant reduction in the likelihood of experiencing a CH by 19 077 vs 061 eventspatientyear HR 081, 95 CI 067097, Pxa0xa0003 and a cardiacrelated ED visit by 28 048 vs 034

Noncancerous extrinsic compression of portal vein to drive PVT formation is rare, but important to identify A 64yearold female with idiopathic hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm HAPA rupture 7 months prior presented with acuteonset hematemesis and melena and was found to have prehepatic portal hypertensive variceal bleeding Her HAPArelated retroperitoneal hematoma had resulted in portal vein compression, thrombosis, and cavernous transformation despite prompt stent graft placement across the ruptured HAPA, and required definitive treatment by transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt creation with portal vein reconstruction utilizing a transsplenic access This case highlights the importance of interval abdominal imaging and hypercoagulability screening for noncirrhotic patients atrisk for PVT, which identified the patient as a heterozygous carrier of Factor V Leiden,Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 causes a vast number of infections and fatalities worldwide As the development and safety validation of effective vaccines are ongoing, drug repurposing is most efficient approach to search FDA approved agents against coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 In the present study, we found that endogenous ACE2 expressions could be detected in H322M and Calu3 cell lines, as well as their ACE2 mRNA and protein expressions were suppressed by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate PDTC, a NFkappa B inhibitor, in dose and timedependent manners Moreover, Nacetylcysteine NAC pretreatment reversed PDTCinduced ACE2 suppression, as well as the combined treatment of hydrogen peroxide and knockdown of p50 subunit of NFkappa B by siRNA reduced ACE2 expression in H322M cells In addition, anthelmintic drug triclabendazole and antiprotozoal drug emetine, repurposed drugs of NFkappa B inhibitor, also inhibited ACE2 mRNA and protein expressions in H322M cells Moreover, zinc supplement augmented the suppressive effects of triclabendazole and emetine on ACE2 suppression in H322M and Calu3 cells Taken together, these results indicate that ACE2 expression is modulated by reactive oxygen species ROS and NFkappa B signal in human lung cell lines, and zinc combination with triclabendazole or emetine has the clinical potential for the prevention and treatment of COVID19,,The p53p21 pathway is activated in response to cell stress However, its role in acute lung injury has not been elucidated Acute lung injury is associated with disruption of the alveolocapillary barrier leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS Mechanical ventilation may be necessary to support gas exchange in patients with ARDS, however, high positive airway pressures can cause regional overdistension of alveolar units and aggravate lung injury Here, we report that acute lung injury and alveolar overstretching activate the p53p21 pathway to maintain homeostasis and avoid massive cell apoptosis A systematic pooling of transcriptomic data from animal models of lung injury demonstrates the enrichment of specific p53 and p21dependent gene signatures and a validated senescence profile In a clinically relevant, murine model of acid aspiration and mechanical ventilation, we observed changes in the nuclear envelope and the underlying chromatin, DNA damage and activation of the Tp53p21 pathway Absence of Cdkn1a decreased the senescent response, but worsened lung injury due to increased cell apoptosis Conversely, treatment with lopinavir andor ritonavir led to Cdkn1a overexpression and ameliorated cell apoptosis and lung injury The activation of these mechanisms was associated with early markers of senescence, including expression of senescencerelated genes and increases in senescenceassociated heterochromatin foci in alveolar cells Autopsy samples from lungs of patients with ARDS revealed increased senescenceassociated heterochromatin foci Collectively, these results suggest that acute lung injury activates p53p21 as an antiapoptotic mechanism to ameliorate damage, but with the side effect of induction of senescence,Background Covid19 is a triphasic disorder characterized by a viral phase lasting 710 days from onset of symptoms In approximately 20 it is followed by a second stage heralded by elevation of pro inflammatory markers such as ferritin, IL6, CRP, LDH and Ddimers We hypothesized that those with few abnormalities would have a low risk for progression to respiratory insufficiency and hence could be monitored at home without treatment Methods Inclusion criteria included Covid infection, age 21, Oxygen saturation 90 To be observed without treatment, patients could have no more than 1 of the following CRP  10 mgdL, high LDH, ferritin  500 ngml, Ddimer  1 mgL, IL6  10 pgml, absolute lymphocyte count 1,000, Oxygen saturation 94, or CT chest evidence of pneumonia Primary endpoint was progression to respiratory failure and secondary endpoints was 28day survival Results Of 208 entered, 132 were lowrisk and hence were monitored without therapy None progressed to respiratory failure or died Conclusions We have shown that our approach can identify cases who can safely be observed without treatment, thus avoiding expensive, potentially toxic therapies, and circumventing unnecessary, costly hospitalizations These results support our hypothesis that applying our criteria, 64 of Covid19 cases can be monitored as outpatients without therapy What is already known about this subject COVID19 is a triphasic disorder first typified by an infectious or viral phase that lasts from the first onset of symptoms until 710 days later This is followed by a second phase considered as the inflammatory stage, characterized initially by the appearance of lung infiltrates which is followed in some cases by hypoxemiaApproximately 80 of patients never proceed to the second phase but currently there is no reliable and objective method to accurately predict those that are cured spontaneously without any treatment and who could be managed at home What this study adds We have developed an approach, based essentially on bloodbased inflammatory markers which identifies lowrisk cases that do not require therapy and can be managed at home This method showed an excellent correlation with clinical outcome and has encouraging financial and psychological effectsOf 208 patients, 132, fulfilled criteria for lowrisk disease that justified monitoring at home without therapy and none of these developed respiratory failure or any other significant complicationIncluded in this lowrisk group were many cases with comorbidities, with COVID19 pneumonia, as well as patients older than 65 and with more than two symptoms at presentation These characteristics would usually portend an unfavourable prognosis, yet all these patients had an excellent outcome,BACKGROUND Ecological evidence suggests that exposure to air pollution affects coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 outcomes However, no individuallevel study has confirmed the association to date METHODS We identified COVID19 patients diagnosed at the University of Cincinnati hospitals and clinics and estimated particulate matter 25xa0μm PM25 exposure over a 10year period 20082017 at their residential zip codes We used logistic regression to evaluate the association between PM25 exposure and hospitalizations for COVID19, adjusting for socioeconomic characteristics and comorbidities RESULTS Among the 1128 patients included in our study, the mean standard deviation PM25 was 1134 070 μgm3 for the 10year average exposure and 1383 103 μgm3 for the 10year maximal exposures The association between longterm PM25 exposure and hospitalization for COVID19 was contingent upon having preexisting asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary COPD Pinteractionxa0xa00030 for average PM25 and Pinteractionxa0xa00001 for maximal PM25 In COVID19 patients with asthma or COPD, the odds of hospitalization were 62 higher with 1xa0μgm3 increment in 10year average PM25 odds ratio OR 162, 95 confidence interval CI 100264 and 65 higher with 1xa0μgm3 increase in 10year maximal PM25 levels OR 165, 95 CI 116235 However, among COVID19 patients without asthma or COPD, PM25 exposure was not associated with higher hospitalizations OR 084, 95 CI 065109 for average PM25 and OR 078, 95 CI 065095 for maximal PM25 CONCLUSIONS Longterm exposure to PM25 is associated with higher odds of hospitalization in COVID19 patients with preexisting asthma or COPD,OBJECTIVES Indication for invasive mechanical ventilation in COVID19 pneumonia has been a major challenge This study aimed to evaluate if lung ultrasound LUS can assist identification of requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation in moderate to severe COVID19 pneumonia MATERIALS AND METHODS Between April 23 and November 12, 2020, hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID19 oxygen demand 4u2009Lmin were included consecutively Lung ultrasound was performed daily until invasive mechanical ventilation IMVgroup or spontaneous recovery nonIMVgroup Clinical parameters and lung ultrasound findings were compared between groups, at intubation IMVgroup and highest oxygen demand nonIMVgroup A reference group with oxygen demand 4u2009Lmin was examined at hospital admission RESULTS Altogether 72 patients were included 50 study patients IMVgroup, n  23 nonIMVgroup, n  27 and 22 reference patients LUSscore correlated to oxygen demand SpO2 FiO2 ratio r  0728 p,Purpose To evaluate the longitudinal changes in retinal vessel diameters in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 Methods This study included 25 patients with COVID19 Group 1 and 25 healthy subjects Group 2 The diameters of peripapillary temporal and nasal retinal arteries and veins were measured at baseline and at 4xa0months after remission Results The baseline diameters of the inferior temporal vein and the artery were increased in group 1 compared to controls p xa0007 and p xa0041, respectively There was also an increase in the diameters of the inferior and superior nasal veins and arteries in group 1 at baseline p xa0001, p xa0019, p xa0037, and p xa0008, respectively Retinal vessel diameters decreased after remission in all quadrants in comparison to baseline measurements all p xa005 Conclusion Increased retinal vessel diameters were measured in COVID19 patients during the disease Measurement of retinal vessel diameters may be a noninvasive method of estimating the vascular risk,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 SARSCoV2 infects both children and adults but epidemiological and clinical data demonstrate that children are less likely to have a severe disease course or die Furthermore, asthmatic children show less severe disease manifestations when infected with SARSCoV2 comparing to adults This review focuses on SARSCoV2 and childhood asthma interaction and aims at summarizing the current knowledge of the potential mechanisms that ameliorate disease symptomatology in asthmatic children,Asthma is the most frequent chronic condition in childhood and a current concern exists about asthma in the pediatric population and its risk for severe SARSCoV2 infection Although all ages can be affected, SARSCoV2 infection has lower clinical impact on children and adolescents than on adults Fever, cough and shortness of breath are the most common symptoms and signs in children wheezing has not been frequently reported Published studies suggest that children with asthma do not appear to be disproportionately more affected by COVID19 This hypothesis raises two issues is asthma andor atopy an independent protective factor for COVID19 If yes, why Explanations for this could include the lower IFNα production, protective role of eosinophils in the airway, and antiviral and immunomodulatory proprieties of inhaled steroids Additionally, recent evidence supports that allergic sensitization is inversely related to ACE2 expression Obesity is a known risk factor for COVID19 in adults However, in the childhood asthmaobesity phenotype, the classic atopic Th2 pattern seems to predominate, which could hypothetically be a protective factor for severe SARSCoV2 infection in children with both conditions Finally, the return to school activities raises concerns, as asymptomatic children could act as vectors for the spread of the disease Although this is still a controversial topic, the identification and management of asymptomatic children is an important approach during the SARSCoV2 epidemic Focus on asthma control, risk stratification, and medication adherence will be essential to allow children with asthma to return safely to school,BACKGROUND Treatment numbers of various cardiovascular diseases were reduced throughout the early phase of the ongoing COVID19 pandemic Aim of this study was to a expand previous study periods to examine the longterm course of hospital admission numbers, b provide data for in and outpatient care pathways, and c illustrate changes of numbers of cardiovascular procedures METHODS AND RESULTS Administrative data of patients with ICD10encoded primary diagnoses of cardiovascular diseases heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease and in or outpatient treatment between March, 13th 2020 and September, 10th 2020 were analyzed and compared with 2019 data Numbers of cardiovascular procedures were calculated using OPScodes The cumulative hospital admission deficit CumAD was computed as the difference between expected and observed admissions for every week in 2020 In total, 80 hospitals contributed 294u2009361 patient cases to the database without relevant differences in baseline characteristics between the studied periods There was a CumAD of 10 to 16 at the end of the study interval in 2020 for all disease groups driven to varying degrees by both reductions of in and outpatient case numbers The number of performed interventions was significantly reduced for all examined procedures catheter ablations 10 cardiac electronic device implantations 7 percutaneous cardiovascular interventions 9 cardiovascular surgery 15 CONCLUSIONS This study provides data on the longterm development of cardiovascular patient care during the COVID19 pandemic demonstrating a significant CumAD for several cardiovascular diseases and a concomitant performance deficit of cardiovascular interventions,We describe the case of a healthy patient with moderate COVID19 infection without thrombophilia nor coronary disease background who presented with a relapsing thrombotic occlusion of the right coronary artery despite normal oxygenation, adequate antiaggregation and prophylactic anticoagulation Prophylactic anticoagulation recommendations in COVID19 were inadequate for this patient Further data are needed to propose fulldose therapeutic anticoagulation for patients with coronary thrombosis and COVID19 infection This could nevertheless be considered even in mild forms of COVID19,Novel COVID19 continues to intrigue medical professionals with its varied presentations Though it affects the respiratory tract primarily, thrombogenesis has been the Achilles heel A 44yearold man diagnosed with COVID19 presented with upper limb pain at a local hospital and was found to have thrombosis of the right axillary artery Despite a successful embolectomy at the local hospital, there was reocclusion of the axillary artery and the limb became ischaemic He was referred to our institution by which time the limb became gangrenous above the elbow and had to be amputated Extensive sloughing of the nerves was also seen in the local area Hypercoagulability presenting with various manifestations is common in COVID19 and needs early anticoagulation We present this asymptomatic patient who lost a limb to this COVID19 sequelae,BACKGROUND A decrease in the pulse oxygen saturation SpO2 level is an indicator of hypoxemia that may occur in various respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD, sleep apnea syndrome SAS and the coronavirus disease COVID19 There is currently no massmarket wristworn SpO2 monitor meeting the medical standards for pulse oximeters   OBJECTIVE The main objective of this monocentric and prospective clinical study with singleblind analysis was to test and validate the accuracy of the Withings ScanWatchs reflective pulse oximeter function to measure SpO2 levels at different stages of hypoxia The secondary objective is to confirm the safety of this device when used as intended   METHODS To achieve these objectives, we included 14 healthy participants aged 23 to 39, and we induced several stable plateaus of arterial oxygen saturation SaO2 ranging from 100 to 70 to mimic nonhypoxic conditions and then mild, moderate, and severe hypoxic conditions We measured the SpO2 level with a Withings ScanWatch on each participants wrist and the SaO2 from blood samples with a cooximeter, the ABL90 hemoximeter   RESULTS After removal of the inconclusive measurements, we had 275 and 244 conclusive measurements with the two ScanWatches on the participants right and left wrists, evenly distributed among the 3 predetermined SpO2 groups SpO2  80, 80  SpO2  90 and 90  SpO2 We found a strong association and a high level of agreement between the measurements collected from the devices, with a high Pearson correlation coefficient PCC of r  0944 and r  0954 on correlation plots, a low PCC of r  0083 p  0166 and r  023 p  00013 on BlandAltman plots, and a Root Mean Square Error RMSE of 297 and 300 from the participants right and left hands, respectively   CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, the Withings ScanWatches is able to measure SpO2 levels with an adequate accuracy at a clinical grade No undesirable effects or adverse events were reported during the study   CLINICALTRIAL This clinical study, Accuracy of ScanWatch Pulse Oximeter With Profound Hypoxia Clinical Trials Registration Number NCT04380389, was conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practices ISO 141552011, ICH guidelines and the declaration of Helsinki after approval from the Institutional Review Board IRB, Laurel Heights Panel, on March 9, 2020 NIRB 1000437, N Reference 272720 I The selected eligible participants were informed and gave their signed consent prior to enrollment,,Outofhospital cardiac arrest OHCA is a major cause of death in the Western world with an estimated number of 275xa0000 treated with resuscitation attempts by the Emergency Medical Services EMS in Europe each year Overall survival rates remain low, and most studies indicate that around 1 out 10 will survive to 30xa0days Amongst the strongest factors associated with survival in OHCA is first recorded rhythm amendable to defibrillation, early defibrillation and prompt initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation CPR Overall, CPR started prior to EMS arrival has repeatedly been shown to be associated with survival rates 23 times higher compared with no such initiation The primary goal of CPR is to generate sufficient blood flow to vital organs, mainly the brain and heart, until restoration of spontaneous circulation can be achieved Barriers to the initiation of CPR by bystanders in OHCA include fear of being incapable, causing harm, and transmission of infectious diseases Partly due to these barriers, and low rates of CPR, the concept of CPR with compression only was proposed as a simpler form of resuscitation with the aim to be more widely accepted by the public in the 1990s But how reliable is the evidence supporting this simpler form of CPR, and are the outcomes after COCPR comparable to standard CPR,We describe a case of proven transmission of SARSCoV2 from lung donor to recipient The donor had no clinical history or findings suggestive of infection with SARSCoV2 and tested negative by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction RTPCR on a nasopharyngeal NP swab obtained within 48 hours of procurement Lower respiratory tract testing was not performed The recipient developed fever, hypotension and pulmonary infiltrates on posttransplant day 3, and RTPCR testing for SARSCoV2 on an NP swab specimen was nonreactive, but positive on bronchoalveolar lavage BAL fluid One thoracic surgeon present during the transplantation procedure developed COVID19 Sequence analysis of isolates from donor BAL fluid obtained at procurement, the recipient, and the infected thoracic surgeon proved donor origin of recipient and health care worker infection No other organs were procured from this donor Transplant centers and organ procurement organizations should perform SARSCoV2 testing of lower respiratory tract specimens from potential lung donors, and consider enhanced personal protective equipment for health care workers involved in lung procurement and transplantation,BACKGROUND The COVID19 pandemic with the stayathome orders and lockdown has dramatically forced athletes to stop team training and competitions, causing deep changes in habits and lifestyle Aim of this study was to evaluate in a retrospective single center study the cardiovascular CV health and fitness of elite football player after COVID19 lockdown in Italy and to compare such findings with the 2019 offseason period, in order to identify potential differences in the CV features and outcomes METHODS All 29 professional Football players of the first male team were enrolled before resuming training and competition after COVID19 lockdown and underwent several exams including physical examination, resting and stress electrocardiography ECG, echocardiography, spirometry and blood tests RESULTS Median age was 27 years 23 31, with no athlete being COVID19 positive at the time of the evaluation In comparison with the usual offseason 2month detraining, significant differences were found for left ventricular LV mass 189g 172 212 vs 181g 167 206, p0024 and LV mass index for body surface area 94gm2 85 104 vs 88gm2 795 1015, p0017, while LV massfat free mass remained unchanged 28 gKg 26 29 vs 29 gKg 26 32, p0222 Respiratory function and metabolic profile were improved, while no significant changes were found in ECG findings, at rest and during exercise CONCLUSIONS Prolonged abstinence from training and competitions induced by lockdown elicited significant changes in comparison with offseason in parameters ascribable to detraining, as the changes in LV mass, in respiratory function and in metabolic profile,,Introduction During the last 40xa0years equipment has been improved with smaller instruments and sufficient size working channels This has ensured that bronchoscopy offers therapeutic and interventional options Areas covered We provide a review of recent advances and clinical challenges in pediatric bronchoscopy This includes singleuse bronchoscopes, endobronchial ultrasound, and cryoprobe Bronchoscopy in persistent preschool wheezing and asthma is included The indications for interventional bronchoscopy have amplified and included balloon dilatation, endoscopic intubation, the use of airway stents, whole lung lavage, closing of fistulas and air leak, as well as an update on removal of foreign bodies Others include the use of laser and microdebrider in airway surgery Experience with bronchoscope during the COVID19 pandemic has been included in this review PubMed was searched for articles on pediatric bronchoscopy, including rigid bronchoscopy as well as interventional bronchoscopy with a focus on reviewing literature in the past 5 years Expert opinion As the proficiency of pediatric interventional pulmonologists continues to grow more interventions are being performed There is a scarcity of published evidence in this field Courses for pediatric interventional bronchoscopy need to be developed The COVID19 experience resulted in safer bronchoscopy practice for all involved,IntroductionSerious cardiac arrhythmias caused by QTprolonging drugs are difficult to predict based on physiological measurement and preapproval clinical trials Postmarketing surveillance and monitoring are important to generate safety dataObjectivesTo assess whether an observational study using Medicare claims data can detect the arrhythmogenic risk of QTprolonging drugsMethodsWe identified 17 QTprolonging drugs with known risk of torsades des pointes TdP that were not used to treat cardiac arrhythmias Amoxicillin and four serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors SNRIs were used as controls Deidentified claims data of 12 million Medicare beneficiaries were accessed Two separate Cox regressions were done for shortterm and chronicuse drugs The primary outcome was a composite of ventricular arrhythmias andor sudden death, identified by ICD diagnostic codes We explored the independent effect of each study drug on the outcomes Other covariates included patient demographics, comorbidities, and known risk factors for druginduced cardiac arrhythmiaResultsWe were able to detect increased risk in 14 of 17 study drugs 823, and none of the control drugs Among the fluoroquinolones, ciprofloxacin was the safest Azithromycin and clarithromycin were relatively safe compared to erythromycin Compared to SNRIs, both citalopram and escitalopram had increased risk, more so with escitalopram than citalopram Comorbidities associated with increased risk included ischemic heart disease, electrolyte imbalance, bradycardia, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and chronic kidney and liver diseaseConclusionMedicare data can be utilized for postmarketing surveillance and monitoring of the proarrhythmic risk of QTprolonging drugs in older adults,Abstract Although SARSCoV2 is primarily a pulmonarytropic virus, it is nonetheless responsible for multiorgan failure in patients with severe forms of COVID19, particularly those with hypertension or cardiovascular disease Infection requires virus binding to the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 ACE2 monocarboxypeptidase, a regulator of blood pressure homeostasis through its ability to catalyze the proteolysis of Angiotensin II AngII into Ang17 Although assumed, it had not been proven so far whether the SARSCoV2 replication in COVID19 patients could modulate the expression of the ACE2 receptor andor the AngII plasma levels We demonstrate here, that in COVID19 patients the ACE2 mRNA expression is markedly reduced in circulating blood cells This ACE2 gene dysregulation mainly affects the monocytes which also show a lower expression of membrane ACE2 protein Moreover, a significant decrease in soluble ACE2 plasma levels is observed in COVID19 patients, whereas the concentration of sACE2 returns to normal levels in patients recovered from COVID19 In the plasma of COVID19 patients, we also found an increase in AngI and AngII On the other hand, the plasma levels of Ang17 remains almost stable in COVID19 patients Despite the Ang17 presence in the plasma of COVID19 patients it seems insufficient to prevent the effects of massive AngII accumulation These are the first direct evidence that the SARSCoV2 may affect the expression of blood pressure regulators with possible harmful consequences on COVID19 outcome,The SARSCoV2 virus, or COVID19, is responsible for the current global pandemic and has resulted in the death of over 100,000 in the United States Interestingly, rates of venous thromboembolism have been noted to be much higher in those infected with COVID19 Here we report a caseseries of COVID19 patients with diverse presentations of pulmonary embolism PE at our institution We also briefly describe the pathophysiology and mechanisms for pulmonary embolism in COVID19 These cases indicate a need to maintain a high index of suspicion for PE in patients with COVID19, as well as the need to consider occult COVID19 infection in patients with PE in the right clinical circumstance,Due to its debilitating character pneumonectomy this is lastresort procedure Preoperative results of the 6min walking test 6MWT help to identify high risk of postoperative complications and increased mortality in patients undergoing lobectomy for lung cancer The aim of the study was to validate the value of 500 m in 6MWT as an indicator, which differentiates risk of complications in patients undergoing pneumonectomy 125 patients who underwent pneumonectomy at Thoracic Surgery Department between 2009 and 2018 On the day preceding the surgery, patients underwent 6MWT The patients were in median age of 63 years The cutoff value of 500 m identified patients with increased 90day mortality 179 vs 35, odds ratio OR 6271, 95 confidence interval CI 152825739, firstyear mortality 307 vs 116, OR 3378, 95CI 13108709, and overall survival p  002 Patients who covered a distance  500 m had an increased risk of atrial fibrillation 359 vs 163, OR 2880, 95CI 12076870 and cardiac complications 384 vs 198, OR 2537, 95CI 11005849 Patients unable to reach 500 m in 6MWT are in a high risk of postoperative death after pneumonectomy, what may be a result of increased frequency of postoperative cardiac complications Poor result of 6MWT is a predictor of worse overall survival,Introduction Severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure AHRF in COVID19 pneumonia is associated with a high mortality rate, resulting in mounting pressures on intensive care units worldwide Different oxygenation management protocols are used in different centres Most centres switch patients who fail to oxygenate adequately using conventional oxygen therapy COT methods to noninvasive positive pressure ventilation NIPPV, usually continuous positive airway pressure CPAP Other centres resort to invasive mechanical ventilation IMV directly, without a trial of NIPPV In this trial, we aim to compare the efficacy of different approaches in managing COVIDrelated AHRF, and ascertain if CPAP therapy reduces the need for IMV Methods We carried out a retrospective cohort study on patients with laboratoryconfirmed COVID19 at three university hospitals in Essex, United Kingdom We included all patients with significant AHRF defined as needing oxygen therapy FiO2 more than 04 to maintain an oxygen saturation of 92 who were deemed eligible for IMV escalation during a 3month period 1st March to 31st May 2020Results Out of 174 patients who met the criteria, 84 patients received CPAP Group 1 Half needed intubation n42 90 patients did not have a CPAP trial Group 2 766 needed intubation n69 No difference was found between the two groups in demographic criteria or disease severity Our results show a significant difference in 60day mortality between group 1 and 2 25 versus 378, p002 COT as standalone therapy for COVID19 patients group 2 was associated with a trend of more increased risk of intubation and an increased relative risk of death RR 214, 95 CI 139 to 329 This corresponds to a number needed to treat NNT of 374 95 CI 247 to 773 Patients in group 1 who failed CPAP trial and required intubation did not have an increased risk of mortality when compared to group 2 patients who required intubationConclusion Our results support introducing CPAP rather than escalating FiO2 in cases refractory to COT Our study suggests CPAP can be safely used to treat patients with AHRF Clinical trials are needed to guide recommendations for optimum timing and selection of patients most likely to benefit,BACKGROUND The willingness of interventional cardiologists to adopt innovation and implement changes in daytoday practice has received limited study METHODS Onlinebased survey on learning and innovation 38 questions were distributed via email list to interventional cardiologists RESULTS The survey was distributed to 8,110 emails and completed by 621 77, 918 men, 60 in the 35 to 54yearold age group Of the respondents who perform coronary interventions, 45 perform 100 cases of noncomplex percutaneous coronary interventions per year and of the respondents who perform structural interventions, 15 perform more than 100 transcatheter aortic valve replacements per year Most respondents 867 rate themselves as highly likelylikely to introduce recently approved equipment in everyday practice and 475 have tried a new coronary guidewire in the past 6 months The most common reasons for reluctance to use new equipment were high cost 64 and uncertainty about whether it provides additional benefits compared with existing equipment 485 Radial access in STEMI cases is always used by 436 of the respondents and 55 always use radial access for coronary angiography Of those who use femoral access, 32 always use ultrasound guidance and 91 have used a closure device in the last 6 months Most respondents 80 read journals to keep up with current practice and believe that the most effective way to learn is through attendance of workshopsshort courses 775 Most respondents 69 are involved in research CONCLUSION Interventional cardiologists who participated in the survey are highly likely to adopt innovation in daily clinical practice,BackgroundEven when resting pulse oximetry is normal in the patient with acute Covid19, hypoxia can manifest on exertion We summarise the literature on the performance of different rapid tests for exertional desaturation and draw on this evidence base to provide guidance in the context of acute COVID19Main research questions1xa0xa0xa0xa0What exercise tests have been used to assess exertional hypoxia at home or in an ambulatory setting in the context of Covid19 and to what extent have they been validated2xa0xa0xa0xa0What exercise tests have been used to assess exertional hypoxia in other lung conditions, to what extent have they been validated and what is the applicability of these studies to acute Covid19MethodAMED, CINAHL, EMBASE MEDLINE, Cochrane and PubMed using LitCovid, Scholar and Google databases were searched to September 2020 Studies where participants had Covid19 or another lung disease and underwent any form of exercise test which was compared to a reference standard were eligible Risk of bias was assessed using QUADAS 2 A protocol for the review was published on the Medrxiv databaseResultsOf 47 relevant papers, 15 were empirical studies, of which 11 described an attempt to validate one or more exercise desaturation tests in lung diseases other than Covid19 In all but one of these, methodological quality was poor or impossible to fully assess None had been designed as a formal validation study most used simple tests of correlation Only one validation study comparing a 1minute sittostand test 1MSTST with reference to the 6minute walk test 6MWT in 107 patients with interstitial lung disease contained sufficient raw data for us to calculate the sensitivity 88, specificity 81, and positive and negative predictive value 79 and 89 respectively of the 1MSTST The other 4 empirical studies included two predictive studies on patients with Covid19, and two on HIVpositive patients with suspected pneumocystis pneumonia We found no studies on the 40step walk test a less demanding test that is widely used in clinical practice to assess Covid19 patients Heterogeneity of study design precluded metaanalysisDiscussionExertional desaturation tests have not yet been validated in patients with or suspected of having Covid19 A stronger evidence base exists for the diagnostic accuracy of the 1MSTST in chronic long term pulmonary disease, the relative intensity of this test may raise safety concerns in remote consultations or unstable patients The less strenuous 40step walk test should be urgently evaluated,High proportion of patients with multiple myeloma suffer from comorbidities which may alter clinical management Therefore, our aims were to evaluate the prevalence of comorbidities and their impact on survival We included patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma 19902013 in Sweden and all diagnoses from each patient from 1985 A total of 13xa0656 patients with multiple myeloma were included in the study, thereof 7404 54 had comorbidity at diagnosis The risk of death was increased for those with one comorbidity at diagnosis compared to those without any comorbidity hazard ratioxa0xa0119 95 confidence interval114125 this risk was higher for those with two 138 130147 and three or more comorbidities 172 162183 Furthermore, the risk of death was increased in patients with prior history of cancer, arrhythmia, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disease, chronic lung disease, psychological disease, peptic ulcer, neurological disease, peripheral vascular disease, chronic kidney disease, dementia, and inflammatory bowel disease This large study shows that over 50 of multiple myeloma patients have a comorbidity at diagnosis and survival decreased with increasing numbers of comorbidities This emphasizes the importance of comorbidities when evaluating patients and deciding on treatment strategies for individuals with multiple myeloma,,Persistent Somatic Symptom Burden and Sleep Disturbance in Patients with COVID19 During Hospitalization and After Discharge A Prospective Cohort Study  Article abstract 930447,,,Children and young people with asthma need regular monitoring to maintain good asthma control, prevent asthma attacks and manage comorbidities The COVID19 pandemic has resulted in healthcare professionals making fundamental changes to the way healthcare is delivered and for patients and families adapting to these changes Comprehensive remotely delivered, technologybased healthcare, closer to the patients home reducing hospital footfall and possibly reducing carbon footprint is likely to be one of the important collateral effects of the pandemic Telemedicine is anticipated to impact everyone involved in healthcare  providers and patients alike It is going to bring changes to organization, work areas and work culture in healthcare Healthcare providers, policymakers and those accessing healthcare services will experience the impact of technologybased healthcare delivery Telemedicine can play an exciting role in the management of childhood asthma by delivering highquality care closer to the childs home However, unlike adults, children still need to be accompanied by their carers for virtual care Policymakers will need to take into account potential additional costs as well as the legal, ethical and cultural implications of large scale use of telemedicine In this narrative review, we review evidence regarding the role of telemedicine and related emerging technologies in paediatric and adolescent asthma Although there are gaps in the current knowledge, there is evidence demonstrating the important role of telemedicine in management of childhood and adolescent asthma However, there is an urgent need for healthcare researchers and policymakers to focus on improving the technologies and address the disparities in accessing novel technologybased management strategies to improve asthma care,In the early phase of the Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic, it was postulated that the reninangiotensinsystem inhibitors RASi increase the infection risk This was primarily based on numerous reports, which stated that the RASi could increase the organ Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2, the receptor of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2, in rodents RASi can theoretically antagonize the potential influence of angiotensin II Ang II on ACE2 However, while Ang II decreases the ACE2 levels in cultured cells, there is little evidence that supports this phenomenon in living animals In this study, we tested whether Ang II or Ang II combined with its antagonist would alter the ACE2 and other molecules associated with the infection of SARSCoV2 Male C57BL6J mice were administered vehicle, Ang II 400xa0ngkgmin, or Ang II with losartan 10xa0mgkgmin for 2xa0weeks ACE2 knockout mice were used as a negative control for the ACE2 assay We found that both Ang II, which elevated blood pressure by 30xa0mmxa0Hg, and Ang II with losartan, had no effect on the expression or protein activity of ACE2 in the lung, left ventricle, kidney, and ileum Likewise, these interventions had no effect on the expression of Transmembrane Protease Serine 2 TMPRSS2 and Furin, proteases that facilitate the viruscell fusion, and the expression or activity of Tumor Necrosis Factor αConvertase TACE that cleaves cellsurface ACE2 Collectively, physiological concentrations of Ang II do not modulate the molecules associated with SARSCoV2 infection These results support the recent observational studies suggesting that the use of RASi is not a risk factor for COVID19,ABSTRACT  Background There is an urgent need for tools allowing the early prognosis and subsequent monitoring of individuals with heterogeneous COVID19 disease trajectories Preexisting cardiovascular CV disease is a leading risk factor for COVID19 susceptibility and poor outcomes, and cardiac involvement is prevalent in COVID19 patients both during the acute phase as well as in convalescence The utility of traditional CV risk biomarkers in mild COVID19 disease or across disease course is poorly understood We sought to determine if a previously validated 27protein predictor of CV outcomes served a purpose in COVID19   Methods The 27protein test of residual CV RCV risk was applied without modification to n860 plasma samples from hospitalized and nonhospitalized SARSCoV2 infected individuals at disease presentation from three independent cohorts to predict COVID19 severity and mortality The same test was applied to an additional n991 longitudinal samples to assess sensitivity to change in CV risk throughout the course of infection into convalescence   Results In each independent cohort, RCV predictions were significantly related to maximal subsequent COVID19 severity and to mortality At the baseline blood draw, the mean proteinpredicted likelihood of an event in subjects who died during the study period ranged from 8899 while it ranged from 836 in subjects who were not admitted to hospital Additionally, the test outperformed existing risk predictors based on commonly used laboratory chemistry values or presence of comorbidities Application of the RCV test to sequential samples showed dramatic increases in risk during the first few days of infection followed by risk reduction in the survivors a period of catastrophically high cardiovascular risk above 50 typically lasted 812 days and had not resolved to normal levels in most people within that timescale   Conclusions The finding that a 27protein candidate CV surrogate endpoint developed in multimorbid patients prior to the pandemic is both prognostic and acutely sensitive to the adverse effects of COVID19 suggests that this disease activates the same biologic riskrelated mechanisms The test may be useful for monitoring recovery and drug response,BACKGROUND Blood centers BCs rely on schools and businesses Shelterinplace orders closed them This study determined how COVID19 affected donation habits STUDY DESIGN AND

envelopes with the host cell membranes and deliver their genetic material Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is the seventh coronavirus closest to the bat severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS that infects humans COVID19 attacks the respiratory system and stimulates the host inflammatory responses, promotes the recruitment of immune cells, and enhances angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2 activities Patients with confirmed COVID19 may have experienced fever, dry cough, headache, dyspnea, acute kidney injury AKI, acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS, and acute heart injury Several strategies such as oxygen therapy, ventilation, antibiotic or antiviral therapy, and renal replacement therapy are commonly used to decrease COVID19associated mortality Inflammation is a common and important factor in the pathogenesis of COVID19 In recent years, stem cellbased therapies represent a promising therapeutic option against various diseases Mesenchymal stem cells MSCs are multipotent stem cells that can selfrenew and differentiate into various tissues of mesodermal origin MSCs can be derived from bone marrow, adipose tissue, and umbilical cord blood MSCs with their unique immunomodulatory properties represent a promising therapeutic alternative against diseases associated with inflammation Several previous studies have shown that MSCs with a strong safety profile can improve the treatment of patients with COVID19 The information in this review provides a summary of the prevention and diagnosis of COVID19 Also, we focus on the current clinical application of MSCs for treatments of patients with COVID19,A 38yearold man presented to emergency department with dizziness, dyspnea and diarrhea for 5 days Serum lab data revealed lymphopenia and computed tomography imaging of the chest exhibited multiple groundglass patches in bilateral lung fields COVID19 was suspected and further examination was done But patients dyspnea progressed while waiting for the result of COVID19 examination and respiratory failure with cardiac arrest occurred eventually, acute myocardial infarction was diagnosed then This article is aimed to discuss the dilemmas in managing acute myocardial infarction during COVID19 pandemic,Pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by progressive and irreversible scarring in the lungs with poor prognosis and treatment It is caused by various factors, including environmental and occupational exposures, and some rheumatic immune diseases Even the rapid global spread of the COVID19 pandemic can also cause pulmonary fibrosis with a high probability Functions attributed to long noncoding RNAs lncRNAs make them highly attractive diagnostic and therapeutic targets in fibroproliferative diseases Therefore, an understanding of the specific mechanisms by which lncRNAs regulate pulmonary fibrotic pathogenesis is urgently needed to identify new possibilities for therapy In this review, we focus on the molecular mechanisms and implications of lncRNAs targeted proteincoding and noncoding genes during pulmonary fibrogenesis, and systematically analyze the communication of lncRNAs with various types of RNAs, including microRNA, circular RNA and mRNA Finally, we propose the potential approach of lncRNAbased diagnosis and therapy for pulmonary fibrosis We hope that understanding these interactions between proteincoding and noncoding genes will contribute to the development of lncRNAbased clinical applications for pulmonary fibrosis,The coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 has spread over the world for more than one year COVID19 often develops lifethreatening hypoxemia Endothelial injury caused by the viral infection leads to intravascular coagulation and ventilationperfusion mismatch However, besides above pathogenic mechanisms, the role of alveolar edema in the disease progression has not been discussed comprehensively Since the exudation of pulmonary edema fluid was extremely serious in COVID19 patients, we bring out a hypothesis that severity of alveolar edema may determine the size of poorlyventilated area and the blood oxygen content Treatments to pulmonary edema alcoholoxygen vapor therapy and fluid management may be great helpful for reducing occurrence of severe cases Given that late mechanical ventilation may cause mucus edema fluid to be blown to the deep of the small airways, oxygen therapy should be given at the early stages The optimal time and SpO2 threshold for oxygen therapy are also discussed,BackgroundVapingassociated lung injury is a newly emerging disease process with the potential for serious health implications and high mortality, even despite the lack of underlying lung disease We present a case of a young, otherwise healthy patient with tetrahydrocannabinol vapingassociated lung injuryCase presentationA 23yearold Caucasian man with a past history of tetrahydrocannabinol vaping and benzodiazepine and methamphetamine abuse presented to the emergency department of our institution with a complaint of feeling malnourished over the past 5 days, along with associated fevers, cough, and vomiting His past medical, surgical, family, and social histories were significant only for the recent use of marijuana vaping pens Upon initial presentation, the patient appeared to be in significant respiratory distress A computed tomographic scan of his chest demonstrated diffuse central predominant interstitial opacities, and he was admitted to the medical intensive care unit, where he was eventually intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure No other cause of his respiratory failure was found, and it was ultimately believed that the patient had sustained a vapingassociated lung injuryConclusionTetrahydrocannabinolcontaining vapingassociated lung injury is still poorly understood overall and is currently being investigated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention In the meantime, physicians should consider vaping to be a public health emergency We summarize the appropriate history, physical examination, appropriate workup, and therapies that physicians should be aware of in order to appropriately manage and treat patients presenting with suspected vapingassociated lung injury,Cardiovascular CV diseases and lower respiratory tract infections dominate human burden of disease across the world Combined, they cause nearly 20 million or 36 of annual global deaths 1 Additionally, both are linked together and interact bidirectionally underlying CV disease is an established risk factor for the development of pneumonia and poor prognosis during pneumonia 2, 3, and vice versa, the role of pneumonia as risk factor for CV complications and newonset CV disease has been demonstrated 46 Preventing cardiovascular events after pneumonia by aspirin another step forward, but questions remain httpsbitly2H5z4OB,The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCov2, is the causative pathogen of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19, which is primarily described as a respiratory illness However, a wide array of cardiovascular complications has also been described in the setting of COVID19 Wellens syndrome, also regarded as a left anterior descending coronary Twave syndrome, is an electrocardiography EKG pattern that indicates critical proximal left anterior descending LAD artery stenosis It is characterized by deeply inverted Twaves or biphasic Twaves in the anterior precordial chest leads in a patient with unstable angina Patients typically present with symptoms consistent with acute coronary syndrome To our knowledge, we presentxa0the first case of Wellens syndrome in a patient with a COVID19 infection Furthermore, this case describes stenosis of the left circumflex artery, a variant of the unusual angiographic findings associated with Wellens, as it is usually associated with occlusion of the proximal LAD The pathophysiology of cardiovascular complications associated with COVID19 is not wellunderstood nevertheless, it was reported that mortality from coronary artery disease CAD complications is significantly higher in these patient populations Healthcare providers should also be aware of identifying Wellens syndrome, as urgent coronary angiography is superior to stress testing,ObjectiveTo compare intravenous methylprednisolone IVMP with oral prednisolone OP for the treatment of West syndromeMethodsIn this randomized, openlabel trial, children aged 2 to 30 mo presenting with epileptic spasms with hypsarrhythmia or its variants on EEG were randomized to receive either IVMP 30xa0mgkgd for 3 d followed by oral prednisolone taper or OP 4xa0mgkgd for two weeks followed by taper The primary outcome measure was spasms

first nationwide audit in Australia to establish the current practices across cardiac genetics clinics METHOD An audit of records of patients with a suspected genetic heart disease cardiomyopathy, primary arrhythmia, autosomal dominant congenital heart disease who had a cardiac genetics consultation between 1st January 2016 and 31 July 2018 and were offered a diagnostic genetic test RESULTS This audit included 536 records at multidisciplinary cardiac genetics clinics from 11 public tertiary hospitals across five Australian states Most genetic consultations occurred in a clinic setting 90, followed by inpatient 6 and Telehealth 4 Queensland had the highest proportion of Telehealth consultations 9 of state total Sixtysix percent of patients had a clinical diagnosis of a cardiomyopathy, 28 a primary arrhythmia, and 07 congenital heart disease The reason for diagnosis was most commonly as a result of investigations of symptoms 73 Most patients were referred by a cardiologist 85, followed by a general practitioner 9 and most genetic tests were funded by the state Genetic Health Service 73 Nationally, 29 of genetic tests identified a pathogenic or likely pathogenic gene variant 32 of cardiomyopathies, 26 of primary arrhythmia syndromes, and 25 of congenital heart disease CONCLUSION We provide important information describing the current models of care for genetic heart diseases throughout Australia These baseline data will inform the implementation and impact of whole genome sequencing in the Australian healthcare landscape,,The unprecedented nature of the COVID19 pandemic has challenged how and whether patients with heart disease are able to safely access centerbased exercise training and cardiac rehabilitation CR This commentary provides an experiencebased overview of how one health system quickly developed and applied inclusive policies to allow patients to have safe and effective access to exercisebased CR,Abstract IntroductionThere is considerable overlap between the clinical manifestations of covid19 pneumonia and the acute interstitial lung disease seen in certain rheumaticxa0disorders In addition, pulmonary fibrosis is increasingly recognised as a potentially serious consequence of bothMethodsThis review explores this overlap of clinical features, risk factors and causation, offering insights into the immune mechanisms that contribute to both sets ofxa0disordersResultsThe therapeutic role of immunosuppression and biologic agents in the treatment of covid19 is explained in the light of thisDiscussionWe propose how lessons learned from the insights recently gained into each disorder can improve our insight into immunological mechanisms and application of therapeutic interventions in the other,Background Patients infected with SARSCoV2 having preexisting noncommunicable diseases NCDs are at a higher risk of complications Obesity is one of the proven risk factors causing NCDs and can influence outcomes of COVID19 patients It is closely related to obstructive sleep apnea OSA The increased risk of COVID19 and reduced access to treatment of nonCOVID conditions during the pandemic may increase the stress in obese patients with OSA This situation makes it necessary for them to cope with their condition by themselves This review aimed at the effect of this pandemic on these patients and coping strategies for them Methods Databases like PubMed and Scopus were searched using a combination of key words Fulltext articles meeting the inclusion criteria were selected Results The search yielded eight studies, discussing about the potential interactions between the COVID19, obesity and OSA, the impact of COVID19 on them, and management of these patients Conclusions Increased prevalence of COVID19 was found among obese patients with OSA The fear of COVID19 and shift of health care workers to manage COVID19 patients has affected their regular visits to the hospital However, there is lack of coping strategies for them, which should soon be established for these patients,BackgroundSeveral pharmacological agents, such as chloroquinehydroxychloroquine, have been promoted for COVID19 treatment or preexposure prophylaxis However, no comprehensive evaluation of the safety of these possible agents is available, and is urgently neededObjectiveThe purpose of this study was to investigate the risks of cardiac adverse events associated with the possible pharmacotherapies for COVID19, including certain antimalarial, antiviral, and antibiotic drugsPatients and MethodsWe conduced retrospective pharmacovigilance analyses of the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database The reporting odds ratio ROR, a data mining algorithm commonly used in pharmacovigilance assessment, was generated to quantify the detection signal of adverse eventsResultsAmong individuals without coronavirus infection from 2015 Q1 to 2020 Q1, increased risks for cardiac disorders were found for antiviral agents such as chloroquinehydroxychloroquine ROR 168 95 confidence interval CI 166170, lopinavirritonavir ROR 152 95 CI 139166, and antibiotics such as azithromycin ROR 137 95 CI 130144 and ceftriaxone ROR 192 95 CI 180205 Increased serious cardiac adverse events, including myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, and cardiac arrest, were also reported for these drugs Further analyses of individuals with coronavirus infections revealed that 40 of individuals receiving chloroquinehydroxychloroquine reported serious cardiac adverse events Two cases resulted in QT prolongations and one case resulted in cardiac arrest Chloroquinehydroxychloroquine and azithromycin contributed to all the QT prolongation and cardiac arrest casesConclusionsThe current pharmacotherapies for COVID19 are associated with increased risks of cardiac adverse events Variations in the cardiac safety profiles of these pharmacotherapies were also observed Clinicians should closely monitor patients with COVID19, especially those at high risk, using chloroquinehydroxychloroquine and azithromycin,,Advanced interventional pulmonary procedures of the airways, pleural space, and mediastinum continue to evolve and be refined Healthcare, finance, and clinical professionals are challenged by both the indications and related coding complexities As the scope of interventional pulmonary procedures expands with advanced technique and medical innovation, program planning and ongoing collaboration between clinicians, finance executives, and reimbursement experts are key elements for success We describe advanced bronchoscopic procedures, appropriate CPT coding, valuations, and necessary modifiers to fill the knowledge gap between basic and advanced procedural coding Our approach is to balance the description of procedures with the associated coding in a way that is of utility to the proceduralist, the coding specialists, and other nonclinical professionals,The pulmonary endothelium is an immediate recipient of high oxygen concentrations upon oxygen therapy and mediates downstream responses Cyclic collapse and reopening of atelectatic lung areas during mechanical ventilation with high fractions of inspired oxygen result in the propagation of oxygen oscillations in the hypoxichyperoxic range We used primary murine lung endothelial cell cultures to investigate cell responses to constant and oscillating oxygen conditions in the hypoxic to hyperoxic range Severe constant hyperoxia had proinflammatory and cytotoxic effects including an increase in expression of ICAM1, Eselectin, and RAGE at 24xa0hr exposure The coagulativefibrinolytic system responded by upregulation of uPA, tPA, and vWF and PAI1 under constant severe hyperoxia Among antioxidant enzymes, the upregulation of SOD2, TXN1, TXNRD3, GPX1, and Gstp1 at 24xa0hr, but downregulation of SOD3 at 72xa0hr constant hyperoxia was evident Hypoxichyperoxic oscillating oxygen conditions induced proinflammatory cytokine release to a lesser extent and later than constant hyperoxia Gene expression analyses showed upregulation of NFKB p65 mRNA at 72xa0hr More evident was a biphasic response of NOS3 and ACE1 gene expression downregulation until 24xa0hr and upregulation at 72xa0hr ACE2 mRNA was upregulated until 72xa0hr, but shedding of the mature protein from the cell surface favored ACE1 Oscillations resulted in severe production of peroxynitrite, but apart from upregulation of Gstp1 at 24xa0hr responses of antioxidative proteins were less pronounced than under constant hyperoxia Oscillating oxygen in the hypoxichyperoxic range has a characteristical impact on vasoactive mediators like NOS3 and on the activation of the reninangiotensin system in the lung endothelium,Abstract  Context Serum cortisol may be associated with cardiovascular risk factors and mortality in patients undergoing coronary angiography, but previous data on this topic are limited and controversial   Objective We evaluated whether morning serum cortisol is associated with cardiovascular risk factors, lymphocyte subtypes and mortality   Design and Setting This is a prospective cohort study performed at a tertiary care centre in southwest Germany between 1997 and 2000   Participants We included 3052 study participants who underwent coronary angiography   Main Outcome Measures Primary outcome measures were cardiovascular risk factors, lymphocyte subtypes and allcause and cardiovascular mortality   Results Serum cortisol was associated with an adverse cardiovascular risk profile, but there was no significant association with coronary artery disease or acute coronary syndrome In a subsample of 2107 participants, serum cortisol was positively associated with certain lymphocyte subsets including CD16CD56 natural killer cells p0001 Comparing the fourth versus the first serum cortisol quartile, the crude Cox proportional hazard ratios with 95 confidence intervals were 122 100 to 147 for allcause and 132 104 to 167 for cardiovascular mortality, respectively After adjustments for various cardiovascular risk factors, these associations were attenuated to 093 076 to 114 for allcause, and 097 076 to 125 for cardiovascular mortality, respectively   Conclusions Despite significant associations with classic cardiovascular risk factors and natural killer cells, serum cortisol was no significant and independent predictor of mortality in patients referred to coronary angiography These findings might reflect that adverse cardiovascular effects of cortisol could be counterbalanced by some cardiovascular protective actions,BACKGROUND Preventive behaviours have been recommended to control the spread of SARSCoV2 Adults with chronic diseases CDs are at higher risk of COVID19related mortality compared to the general population Our objective was to evaluate adherence to COVID19 preventive behaviours among adults without CDs compared with those with CDs and identify determinants of nonadherence to COVID19 preventive behaviours STUDY DESIGN Crosssectional SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS We used data from the nationally representative COVID19 Impact Survey n10u2009760 conducted in the USA PRIMARY MEASURES Adults with CDs were categorised based on a selfreported diagnosis of diabetes, high blood pressure, heart diseaseheart attackstroke, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD, bronchitis or emphysema, cystic fibrosis, liver disease, compromised immune system, or cancer 54 RESULTS Compared with adults without CDs, adults with CDs were more likely to adhere to preventive behaviours including wearing a face mask χ2p0001, social distancing χ2p0001, washing or sanitising hands χ2p0001, and avoiding some or all restaurants χ2p0002

encephalomyelitischronic fatigue syndrome MECFS affects tens of millions worldwide the causes of exertional intolerance are poorly understood The MECFS label overlaps with postural orthostatic tachycardia POTS and fibromyalgia, and objective evidence of small fiber neuropathy SFN is reported in ∼50 of POTS and fibromyalgia patients RESEARCH QUESTION Can invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing iCPET and PGP95immunolabeled lowerleg skin biopsies inform the pathophysiology of MECFS exertional intolerance and potential relationships with SFN STUDY DESIGN and Methods We analyzed 1516 upright invasive iCPETs performed to investigate exertional intolerance After excluding patients with intrinsic heart or lung disease and selecting those with right atrial pressures RAP 65 mmHg, results from 160 patients meeting MECFS criteria who had skinbiopsy test results were compared to 36 controls Resttopeak changes in cardiac output Qc were compared to oxygen uptake QcVO2 slope to identify participants with low, normal, or high pulmonary blood flow by QcVO2 tertiles RESULTS During exercise, the 160 MECFS patients averaged lower RAP 192 vs 8315 P00001 and peak VO2 8021 vs 101417 P00001 than controls The lowflow tertile had lower peak Qc than the normal and highflow tertiles 88419 vs 995238 vs 999195 predicted P001 In contrast, systemic oxygen extraction was impaired in highflow versus low and normalflow participants 07401 vs 088011 vs 08601 P00001 in association with peripheral lefttoright shunting Among the 160 MECFS patient biopsies, 31 was consistent with SFN epidermal innervation 50 of predicted P  00001 Denervation severity did not correlate with exertional measures INTERPRETATION These results identify two types of peripheral neurovascular dysregulation that are biologically plausible contributors to MECFS exertional intolerancedepressed Qc from impaired venous return, and impaired peripheral oxygen extraction In patients with smallfiber pathology, neuropathic dysregulation causing microvascular dilation may limit exertion by shunting oxygenated blood from capillary beds and reducing cardiac return,Background xa0COVID19 pneumonia has been

difference in vascular density, myocardial perfusion, molecular signaling, and gene expression between normal diet ND and high fat diet HFD groups at baseline and following intramyocardial injection of EVs Methods and Results Intact male Yorkshire swine fed either an ND n17 or HFD n14 underwent placement of an ameroid constrictor on the left circumflex coronary artery Subsequently, animals received either intramyocardial injection of vehiclesaline as controls NDcontrols n7, HFDcontrols, n6 or EVs NDEVs n10, HFDEVs n8 into the ischemic territory Five weeks later, myocardial function, perfusion, vascular density, cell signaling, and gene expression were examined EVs improved indices of myocardial contractile function, myocardial perfusion, and arteriogenesis in both dietary cohorts Interestingly, quantification of alpha smooth muscle actin demonstrated higher basal arteriolar density in HFD swine compared with their ND counterparts whereas EVs were associated with increased CD31labeled endothelial cell density only in the ND tissue, which approached significance Levels of total endothelial nitric oxide synthase, FOXO1 forkhead box protein O1 , transforming growth factorβ, phosphorylated VEGFR2 vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, and phosphorylated MAPK ERK1ERK2 mitogenactivated protein kinase were higher in ischemic myocardial lysates from NDcontrols compared with HFDcontrols Conversely, HFDcontrol tissue showed increased expression of phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase, phosphorylated FOXO1, VEGFR2, and MAPK ERK1ERK2 with respect to NDcontrols Preliminary gene expression studies indicate differential modulation of transcriptional activity by EVs between the 2 dietary cohorts Conclusions HFD produces a profound metabolic disorder that dysregulates the molecular mechanisms of collateral vessel formation in the ischemic myocardium, which may hinder the therapeutic angiogenic effects of EVs,Inflammatory lung disease results in a high global burden of death and disability There are no effective treatments for the most severe forms of many inflammatory lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, corticosteroidresistant asthma, and coronavirus disease 2019 hence, new treatment options are required Here, we review the role of oxidative imbalance in the development of difficulttotreat inflammatory lung diseases The inflammationinduced overproduction of reactive oxygen species ROS means that endogenous antioxidants may not be sufficient to prevent oxidative damage, resulting in an oxidative imbalance in the lung In turn, intracellular signaling events trigger the production of proinflammatory mediators that perpetuate and aggravate the inflammatory response and may lead to tissue damage The production of high levels of ROS in inflammatory lung diseases can induce the phosphorylation of mitogenactivated protein kinases, the inactivation of phosphoinositide 3kinase PI3K signaling and histone deacetylase 2, a decrease in glucocorticoid binding to its receptor, and thus resistance to glucocorticoid treatment Hence, antioxidant treatment might be a therapeutic option for inflammatory lung diseases Preclinical studies have shown that antioxidants alone or combined with antiinflammatory drugs are effective in the treatment of inflammatory lung diseases, although the clinical evidence of efficacy is weaker Despite the high level of evidence for the efficacy of antioxidants in the treatment of inflammatory lung diseases, the discovery and clinical investigation of safer, more efficacious compounds are now a priority,Over the past two decades, studies have demonstrated that lung ultrasound is useful in diagnosing alveolar interstitial syndrome, which is seen in patients with decompensated Congestive Heart Failure CHF We studied medical students performing lung ultrasound on patients admitted to the hospital with a presumed diagnosis of decompensated CHF in a prospective convenience observation study Two ultrasound‐fellowship trained emergency medicine attendings independently reviewed the lung ultrasounds at a later date, blinded to the students interpretation and other clinical information, to confirm ultrasound findings and assess for inter‐rater reliability of the lung ultrasound using intraclass correlation coefficients ICCs Thirty‐six patients were enrolled in the study resulting in 653 unique lung zones scanned The zones were imaged and classified as being normal B‐lines3 or pathologic B‐lines3 The novice scanners interpretation was compared to expert reviews using intra‐class correlation coefficients The ICC was 088 with a 95 CI 087‐090 for all lung zones scanned There was almost perfect agreement between novice practitioners and experts when determining the presence of pathological B‐lines in individual patients,BackgroundThrombosis and coagulopathy are highly prevalent in critically ill patients with COVID19 and increase the risk of death Immunothrombosis has recently been demonstrated to contribute to the thrombotic events in COVID19 patients with coagulopathy As the primary components of immunothrombosis, neutrophil extracellular traps NETs could be induced by complement cascade components and other proinflammatory mediators We aimed to explore the clinical roles of NETs and the regulation of complement on the NET formation in COVID19MethodsWe recruited 135 COVID19 patients and measured plasma levels of C5, C3, cellfree DNA and myeloperoxidase MPODNA Besides, the formation of NETs was detected by immunofluorescent staining and the cytotoxicity to vascular endothelial HUVEC cells was evaluated by CCK8 assayResultsWe found that the plasma levels of complements C3 and MPODNA were positively related to coagulation indicator fibrinogen degradation products C3 ru2009u20090300, pu2009u20090005 MPODNA ru2009u20090316, pu2009u20090002 in COVID19 patients Besides, C3 was positively related to direct bilirubin ru2009u20090303, pu2009u20090004 and total bilirubin ru2009u20090304, pu2009u20090005, MPODNA was positively related to lactate dehydrogenase ru2009u20090306, pu2009u20090003 and creatine kinase ru2009u20090308, pu2009u20090004 By using antiC3a and antiC5a antibodies, we revealed that the complement component anaphylatoxins in the plasma of COVID19 patients strongly induced NET formation The pathological effect of the anaphylatoxinNET axis on the damage of vascular endothelial cells could be relieved by recombinant carboxypeptidase B CPB, a stable homolog of enzyme CPB2 which can degrade anaphylatoxins to inactive productsConclusionsOveractivation in anaphylatoxinNET axis plays a pathological role in COVID19 Early intervention in anaphylatoxins might help prevent thrombosis and disease progression in COVID19 patients,Objective To quantify the occurrence rate of abnormal ECG findings and symptoms following COVID19 infection Patients Adult patients 18 years old who were participating in collegiate athletics and previously tested positive for COVID19 between August 2020 to November 2020 Methods In this retrospective study, we report findings of electrocardiogram ECG testing to screen athletes for cardiac abnormalities following COVID19 Athletes underwent general examinations and ECG screening prior to being medically cleared for a return to sport following COVID19 Predetermined predictors were grouped into categorical variables including 1 Sex 2 Symptom severity and 3 BMI normal vs overweight   24 kg∙m2 These were used to examine differences of abnormal rates occurred between different predictor categories Results Of the 170 athletes screened, 6 35 presented with abnormal ECG criteria and were referred to cardiology We found no evidence that symptom severity, sex and BMI category were associated with a higher rate of abnormal ECG p  005 Greater severity of COVID19 symptoms were associated with higher percentage of ST depression, Twave inversion, STT changes and presence of fQRS Loss of smell, loss of taste, headache and sore throat were the most prevalent symptoms with 329, 388, 365 and 253 of athletes reporting each symptom, respectively Conclusions Preliminary findings indicate a low risk of myocardial injury secondary to COVID19 infection with less than4 of patients presenting with abnormal ECG and 10 requiring referral to a cardiologist While viral myocarditis was not demonstrated in any athlete referred for cardiology assessment, two patients developed effusative viral pericarditis,Background COVID19 is a respiratory disease associated to thrombotic outcomes with coagulation and endothelial disorders Based on that, several anticoagulation AC guidelines have been proposed We aimed to identify if AC therapy modifies the risk of developing severe COVID19 Methods and Results COVID19 patients initially admitted in medical wards of 24 French hospitals were included prospectively from February 26th to April 20th, 2020 We used Poisson regression model, Cox proportional hazard model and matched propensity score to assess the effect of AC on outcomes intensive care unit ICU admission andor inhospital mortality Study enrolled 2878 COVID19 patients, among whom 382 132 were treated with oral AC therapy prior to hospitalization After adjustment, AC therapy prior to hospitalization was associated with a better prognosis with an adjusted Hazard Ratio aHR 070 95 CI 055088 Analyses performed using propensity score matching confirmed that AC therapy prior to hospitalization was associated with a better prognosis with an aHR of 043 95 CI 029063 for ICU admission and aHR of 076 95 CI 061098 for composite criteria ICU admission andor death In contrast, therapeutic or prophylactic low or high dose AC started during hospitalization were not associated with any of the outcomes Conclusions AC therapy used prior to hospitalization in medical wards was associated with a better prognosis in contrast to AC initiated during hospitalization AC therapy introduced in early step of disease could better prevent COVID19associated coagulopathy, endotheliopathy and prognosis,,BackgroundControversies exist on the nature of COVID19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS in particular on the static compliance of the respiratory system Crs We aimed to analyze the association of Crs with outcome in COVID19associated ARDS, to ascertain its determinants and to describe its evolution at day14MethodsIn this observational multicenter cohort of patients with moderate to severe Covid19 ARDS, Crs was measured at day1 and day14 Association between Crs or Crsideal body weight IBW and breathing without assistance at day28 was analyzed with multivariable logistic regression Determinants were ascertained by multivariable linear regression Day14 Crs was compared to day1 Crs with paired ttest in patients still under controlled mechanical ventilationResultsThe mean Crs in 372 patients was 376u2009u200913xa0mLcmH2O, similar to as in ARDS of other causes Multivariate linear regression identified chronic hypertension, low PaO2FiO2 ratio, low PEEP, and low tidal volume as associated with lower CrsIBW After adjustment on confounders, nor Crs OR 10 CI 95 098102 neither CrsIBW OR 063 CI 95 01331 were associated with the chance of breathing without assistance at day28 whereas plateau pressure was OR 093 CI 95 088099 In a subset of 108 patients, day14 Crs decreased compared to day1 Crs 312u2009u2009144xa0mLcmH2O vs

aim of this study was to evaluate the association between CT findings and laboratory data in a cohort of COVID19 patientsMethodsThis was an observational crosssectional study including consecutive patients presenting to the Reggio Emilia Italy province emergency rooms for suspected COVID19 for one month during the outbreak peak, who underwent chest CT scan and laboratory testing at presentation and resulted positive for SARSCoV2ResultsIncluded were 866 patients Total leukocytes, neutrophils, Creactive protein CRP, creatinine, AST, ALT and LDH increase with worsening parenchymal involvement an increase in platelets was appreciable with the highest burden of lung involvement A decrease in lymphocyte counts paralleled worsening parenchymal extension, along with reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure and saturation After correcting for parenchymal extension, groundglass opacities were associated with reduced platelets and increased procalcitonin, consolidation with increased CRP and reduced oxygen saturationConclusionsPulmonary lesions induced by SARSCoV2 infection were associated with raised inflammatory response, impaired gas exchange and endorgan damage These data suggest that lung lesions probably exert a central role in COVID19 pathogenesis and clinical presentation,Patients with severe coronavirus disease in 2019 COVID19 pneumonia may have many sequelae, which seriously affect their quality of life and work Here, we report a case of infection in China, reviewed the course, treatment, and rehabilitation of a patient suffering from severe COVID19 pneumonia, and collected his examination reports, including chest CT, laboratory examination results, lung function examination, sleep monitoring report, sex hormones, sperm morphology and activity The patients antiviral immunoglobulin G IgG continued to be positive for more than 11 months, and his small airway function was abnormal, and he suffered from respiratory problems cough, chest pain, chest tightness, and shortness of breath, unstructured sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome, and nocturnal sleep hypoxemia His abnormal sperm rate increased obviously, and sperm activity decreased obviously Patients with severe COVID19 pneumonia may have respiratory sequela, the abnormal sperm rate is obviously increased, and IgG positive can last for a long time,BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES We aimed to evaluate sonographic features that may aid in risk stratification and propose a focused cardiac and lung ultrasound LUS algorithm in patients with COVID19 METHODS Two hundred consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID19 underwent comprehensive clinical and echocardiographic examination, as well as LUS, irrespective of clinical indication, within 24 hours of admission as part of a prospective predefined protocol Assessment included calculation of the Modified Early Warning Score MEWS, left ventricular LV systolic and diastolic function, hemodynamic and right ventricular RV assessment and a calculated LUS score We performed outcome analysis to identify echocardiographic and LUS predictors of mortality or the composite event of mortality or need for invasive mechanical ventilation, and to assess their adjunctive value on top of clinical parameters and MEWS RESULTS A simplified echocardiographic risk score comprised of LV ejection fraction 50 combined with TAPSE 18 mm, was associated with mortality p00002 and with the composite event p00001 Stepwise analyses evaluating echocardiographic and LUS parameters on top of existing clinical risk scores showed that addition of TAPSE and SVI improved prediction of mortality when added to clinical variables but not when added to MEWS Once echocardiography was added, and patients recategorized as high risk only if having both high risk MEWS, and highrisk cardiac features, the specificity increased from 63 to 87, positive predictive value from 28 to 48 and accuracy improved from 66 to 85 Although LUS was not associated with incremental risk prediction for mortality above clinical and echocardiographic criteria, it improved prediction of need for invasive mechanical ventilation CONCLUSIONS In hospitalized patients with COVID19, a very limited echocardiographic exam is sufficient for outcome prediction The addition of echocardiography in patients with high risk MEWS score decreases the rate of falsely identifying patients as high risk to die, and may improve resource allocation in case of high patient load BACKGROUND,,Interferons are an ancient and wellconserved group of inflammatory cytokines most famous for their role in viral immunity A decade ago, we discovered that interferons also play an important role in the biology of hematopoietic stem cells HSCs, which are responsible for lifelong blood production Though we have learned a great deal about the role of interferons in HSC quiescence, differentiation, and selfrenewal, there remains some controversy regarding how interferons affect these stem cells, with differing conclusions depending on experimental models and clinical context Here, we review the contradictory roles of type 1 and 2 interferons in hematopoiesis Specifically, we highlight the roles of interferons in embryonic and adult hematopoiesis, along with shortterm and longterm adaptive and maladaptive responses to inflammation We discuss experimental challenges in the study of these powerful yet shortlived cytokines and strategies to address those challenges We also review the contribution by interferons to disease states including bone marrow failure and aplastic anemia, as well as their therapeutic use to treat myeloproliferative neoplasms and viral infections, including SARSCoV2 Understanding the opposing effects of interferons on hematopoiesis will elucidate immune responses, bone marrow failure syndromes, and future therapeutic approaches for patients undergoing HSC transplantation or fighting infectious diseases and cancer,Introduction A growing body of evidence indicates that prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD has been increasing more rapidly among women compared to men, but the available data on the differences between the sexes in the responses to the various COPD therapies are still scarceAreas covered The aim of this narrative review is to provide an overview of current knowledge on sex differences in COPD managementExpert opinion There is no solid evidence of sex differences in response to usual COPD treatments but there are sexrelated differences in management of patients with a clinical diagnosis of COPD It is difficult to explain the reason for these differences, but most likely they are due to local prescribing habits, rather than solid scientific reasons However, there are also signals of different sexrelated responses, the qualification and quantification of which is difficult with the information currently available These signals should lead to the inclusion of more women in clinical trials, but also to the design of prospective clinical studies to assess the possible differences linked to sex in COPD treatment responses, whose identification is an important step toward the definition of personalized COPD therapy,Background Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID19, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2, most frequently presents with respiratory symptoms such as fever, dyspnea, shortness of breath, cough, or myalgias There is now a growing body of evidence that demonstrates that severe SARSCoV2 infections can develop clinically significant coagulopathy, inflammation, and cardiomyopathy, which have been implicated in COVID19 associated cerebrovascular accidents CVAs Case Report We report an uncommon presentation of a 32yearold man who sustained a large vessel cerebellar stroke associated with a severe COVID19 infection He presented with a headache, worse than his usual migraine, dizziness, rotary nystagmus, and dysmetria on exam but had no respiratory symptoms initially He was not a candidate for thrombolytic therapy or endovascular therapy and was managed with clopidogrel, aspirin, and atorvastatin During hospital admission he developed COVID19 related hypoxia and pneumonia, but ultimately he was discharged to home rehabilitation Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This We present this case to increase awareness among emergency physicians of the growing number of reports of neurological and vascular complications such as ischemic CVAs in otherwise healthy individuals who are diagnosed with SARSCoV2 infection A brief review of the current literature will help elucidate possible mechanisms, risk factors, and current treatments for CVA associated with SARSCoV2,Background There have been inconsistent reports regarding the unique manifestations of severe coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 occurring in China This study analyzed the clinical manifestation of 13 severe COVID19 cases at a single institution and compared the data to previously reported characteristics of severe COVID19 in China Methods This retrospective case study included patients with severe COVID19 who were admitted to the isolation ward of the Shandong Chest Hospital from January 2020 to February 2020 The clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory examination results, imaging features, treatment strategies, and patient prognoses were summarized A database search was then conducted for studies published through December 2020 documenting characteristics of severe COVID19 cases in China The pooled results for severe COVID19 patients in China were calculated by using the randomeffects modelResults A total of 4 severe and 9 critical patients were included from Shandong Chest Hospital The average patient age was 553 range 2388 years, and 615 of patients were male Chest computed tomography for all patients showed multiple lesions as groundglass shadows in both lungs All patients presented bacterial infection and various degrees of liver and myocardial injury The treatment strategies for patients included antibiotics, immunoglobulin, and glucocorticoids, and mechanical ventilation was used in all patients for respiratory failure Two patients died, and 11 recovered In the pooled data for severe COVID19 patients, the most common comorbidities were hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary heart disease The common signs in these patients were fever, cough, fatigue, chest tightness, and a leukocyte count  10 Conclusions Older males with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary heart disease may be at higher risk of developing severe COVID19 Patients should be assessed for concomitant bacterial infections Cardiac and liver enzymes, fever, cough, fatigue, chest tightness, and leukocytosis should be monitored for signs of disease progression,STUDY OBJECTIVES Obstructive sleep apnea OSA and other sleep disorders overlap with comorbidities associated with poor outcomes related to SARSCoV2 infection However, the prevalence of OSA among patients hospitalized for COVID19 and relationship to outcomes is poorly characterized, and the relevance of other sleep disorders remains unknown The objective of this study was to identify the prevalence of preexisting sleep disorders and association with outcomes related to severe COVID19 illness METHODS Patients with SARSCoV2 infection admitted to the University of Michigan Hospital System were included Electronic medical records were queried for sleep disorders diagnostic codes Data was extracted from polysomnography and home sleep testing in a subgroup with previous diagnostic testing at our center Logistic regression was used to examine the association of sleep disorders with mechanical ventilation requirement, treatment with vasopressors, and death, and Cox proportional hazards regression for time to discharge RESULTS Among N572 adult patients hospitalized for COVID19, 113 198 patients had OSA, 4 patients had central sleep apnea CSA 07, 5 had hypoventilation 09, 63 had insomnia 110, and 22 had restless legs syndrome or periodic limb movements disorder RLSPLMD 39 After adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and race, no significant relationship was apparent between sleep disorders diagnoses or indices of sleep disordered breathing severity and outcomes CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to determine the prevalence of OSA and other sleep disorders in a wellcharacterized cohort of patients hospitalized for COVID19 Once hospitalized, a significant contribution of sleep disorders to outcomes was not identified Therefore, future evaluations should focus on earlier outcomes, such as infection or clinical manifestations after exposure to SARSCoV2,Objectives and backgroundPeople with diabetes PWD are one of the highrisk groups for coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 infection, increasing the disease mortality This study was aimed to compare the epidemiological characteristics and outcomes of COVID19 in diabetic versus nondiabetic individualsMethodsIn this retrospective observational study, the epidemiological characteristics of the two groups of diabetic n1365 and nondiabetic n15,026 subjects with definite diagnosis of COVID19 in the southwestern region of Iran were compared All clinical signs and comorbidities of the patients were evaluated Chisquare test was used to examine the differences in qualitative variables between diabetic and nondiabetic groupsResultsOf 16,391 enrolled subjects, 83 had diabetes, and 283 of COVID19related deaths occurred in diabetics Also, the mortality rate among diabetics was reported as 143 The average age of diabetic patients and nondiabetic patients was 59 and 37 years, respectively The odds of fever, cough, shortness of breath, headache, and underlying diseases, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, immune deficiency, and hyperlipidemia, were significantly higher in diabetic patients than in nondiabeticsConclusionDiabetes is associated with increased mortality rate in patients with COVID19 and is considered as a major risk factor for COVID19 infection, posing a major public health challenge for health policymakers in managing and controlling the disease Therefore, development of prevention and treatment strategies aimed at reducing COVID19 morbidity and mortality in diabetes patients is of significant importance,To analyze diagnostic accuracy of chest computed tomography CT and RTPCR realtime polymerase chain reaction for COVID19 coronavirus disease 19 pneumonia in early and progressive stages To evaluate if combination of chest CT with RTPCR can supplement the shortage of RTPCR in diagnosis of COVID19 pneumonia We conducted a prospective study on 103 male patients The study population were divided into two groups early COVID19 stage numberxa0xa050 patients, with positive RTPCR but mild symptoms and progressive COVID19 stage numberxa0xa053, positive RTPCR and sever symptoms including feveru2009xa0375xa0°C, cough, and shortness of breath All patients underwent CT imaging The early stage included typical category 34 17 out of 50 cases, 6 indeterminate category 3 cases, 10 atypical category 5 cases and 50 25 cases were normal CT imaging The progressive stage included typical category that was further divided to five subgroups i peripheral bilateral lower lobe groundglass opacity GGO in 377, ii peripheral bilateral lower lobes GGO with peribronchovascular consolidation and bronchiolar dilatation in 188, iii peripheral bilateral lower lobes GGO with crazy paving appearance in 15, iv bilateral diffuse GGO in 188, and v peripheral bilateral GGO with mediastinal lymph node enlargement 94 Chest CT imaging could aid to supplement the shortages of PCR for clinically suspected patients of COVID19 in the epidemic area as CT was positive in 50 of patients Chest CT is very effective in detecting pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities in the progressive stage of COVID19 patients in 100,Up to now, COVID19related vascular changes were mainly described as thromboembolic events A handful of researchers reported another type of vascular abnormality referred to as vascular thickening or vascular enlargement, without specifying whether the dilated vessels are arteries or veins nor providing a physiopathological hypothesis Our observations indicate that the vascular dilatation occurs in the venous compartment, and underlying mechanisms might include increased blood flow due to inflammation and the activation of arteriovenous anastomoses,BACKGROUND COVID19 is associated with both venous and arterial thrombotic complications While prophylactic anticoagulation is now widely recommended for hospitalized patients with COVID19, the effectiveness and safety of thromboprophylaxis in outpatients with COVID19 has not been established STUDY DESIGN PREVENTHD is a doubleblind, placebocontrolled, pragmatic, eventdriven phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in symptomatic outpatients with laboratoryconfirmed COVID19 at risk for thrombotic events, hospitalization, and death Several challenges posed by the pandemic have necessitated innovative approaches to clinical trial design, startup, and conduct Participants are randomized in a 11 ratio, stratified by time from COVID19 confirmation, to either rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily or placebo for 35 days The primary efficacy end point is a composite of symptomatic venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, acute limb ischemia, noncentral nervous system systemic embolization, allcause hospitalization, and allcause mortality The primary safety end point is fatal and critical site bleeding according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis definition Enrollment began in August 2020 and is expected to enroll approximately 4,000 participants to yield the required number of end point events CONCLUSIONS PREVENTHD is a pragmatic trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of the direct oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban in the outpatient setting to reduce major venous and arterial thrombotic events, hospitalization, and mortality associated with COVID19,Background RVEF right ventricular ejection fraction measured by threedimensional echocardiography 3DE has been used in evaluating right ventricular RV function and can provide useful prognostic information in other various cardiovascular diseases However, the prognostic value of 3DRVEF in coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 remains unknown We aimed to investigate whether 3DRVEF can predict the mortality of COVID19 patients Methods A cohort of 128 COVID19confirmed patients who had undergone echocardiography were studied Thirtyone healthy volunteers were also enrolled as controls COVID19 patients were divided into three subgroups general, severe, and critical according to COVID19 severityofillness Conventional RV structure and function parameters, RV free wall longitudinal strain FWLS and 3DRVEF were acquired RVFWLS was measured by twodimensional speckle tracking echocardiography RVEF was acquired by 3DE Results Compared with controls, 2DRVFWLS and 3DRVEF were both significantly decreased in COVID19 patients 272  44 vs 229  48, P  0001 537  45 vs 485  58, P  0001 Critical patients were more likely to have a higher incidence of acute cardiac injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS, and worse prognosis than general and severe patients The critical patients exhibited larger rightheart chambers, worse RV fractional area change RVFAC, 2DRVFWLS, and 3DRVEF and higher proportion of pulmonary hypertension than general and severe patients Eighteen patients died during a median followup of 91 days The multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed the acute cardiac injury, ARDS, RVFAC, RVFWLS, and 3DRVEF were independent predictors of death 3DRVEF chisquare to improve 183 P  0001, RVFAC chisquare to improve 45 P  0034 and 2DRVFWLS chisquare to improve 51 P  0024 all provided additional prognostic value of higher mortality over clinical risk factors Moreover, the incremental predictive value of 3DRVEF was significantly P  005 higher than RVFAC and RVFWLS Conclusion 3DRVEF was the most robust independent predictor of mortality in COVID19 patients and provided a higher predictive value over conventional RV function parameters and RVFWLS, which may be helpful to identify COVID19 patients at a higher risk of death,The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 secondary to the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 has bestowed an unprecedented challenge upon us, resulting in an international public health emergency COVID19 has already resulted in u20091,600,000 deaths worldwide and the fear of a global economic collapse SARSCoV2 is notorious for causing acute respiratory distress syndrome, however emerging literature suggests various dreaded cardiac manifestations associated with high mortality The mechanism of myocardial damage in COVID19 is unclear but thought to be multifactorial and mainly driven by the hosts immune response cytokine storm, hypoxemia and direct myocardial injury by the virus Cardiac manifestations from COVID19 include but are not limited to, acute myocardial injury, cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure and acute coronary syndrome Cardiac imaging is paramount to appropriately diagnose and manage the cardiac manifestations of COVID19 Herein, we present cardiac imaging findings of COVID19 patients with biomarker and imaging confirmed myocarditis to provide insight regarding the variable manifestations of COVID19 myocarditis via Cardiac MRI CMR coupled with CMRedema education along with recommendations on how to incorporate advanced CMR into the clinicians COVID19 armamentarium,Lung infection named as COVID19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 CT computed tomography has been shown to have good sensitivity in comparison with RTPCR, particularly in early stages However, CT findings appear to not always be related to a certain clinical severity The aim of this study is to evaluate a correlation between the percentage of lung parenchyma volume involved with COVID19 infection compared to the total lung volume at baseline diagnosis and correlated to the patients clinical course need for ventilator assistance and or death All patients with suspected COVID19 lung disease referred to our imaging department for Chest CT from 24 February to 6 April 2020were included in the study Specific CT features were assessed including the amount of high attenuation areas HAA related to lung infection HAA, defined as the percentage of lung parenchyma above a predefined threshold of 650 HAA, HAAtotal lung volume, was automatically calculated using a dedicated segmentation software Lung volumes and CT findings were correlated with patients clinical course Logistic regressions were performed to assess the predictive value of clinical, inflammatory and CT parameters for the defined outcome In the overall population we found an average infected lung volume of 314  263 while in the subgroup of patients who needed ventilator assistance and who died as well as the patients who died without receiving ventilator assistance the volume of infected lung was significantly higher 414  285 and 727  362 p  0001 In logistic regression analysis best predictors for ventilation and death were the presence of air bronchogram p  0006, crazy paving p  0007, peripheral distribution p  0001, age p  0002, fever at admission p  0007, dyspnea p  0002 and cardiovascular comorbidities p  0001 In multivariable analysis, quantitative CT parameters and features added incremental predictive value beyond a model with only clinical parameters area under the curve, 078 vs 074, p  002 Our study demonstrates that quantitative evaluation of lung volume involved by COVID19 pneumonia helps to predict patients clinical course,Background Patients with COVID19 present with diagnostic challenges as it can cause varied endorgan failures that mimic respiratory distress of pulmonary origin Early identification of concurrent complications can significantly alter patient management and course Pointofcare ultrasound POCUS can be particularly useful in helping to differentiate concomitant complications with COVID19 While lung POCUS findings related to COVID19 have been published, little guidance exists on how ultrasound can be incorporated into a more comprehensive evaluation of patients under investigation PUI for COVID19 Objectives We devised a pathway called COVUS that incorporates POCUS into the initial evaluation of PUIs for COVID19 to guide diagnosis and management Discussion The pathway was derived based on review of literature, consensus from the ultrasound faculty, as well as feedback from the entire faculty group at one academic institution with high volumes of COVID19 patients The scanning protocol utilizes a cardiac first, rather than lung first, approach to identify potential concomitant organ failure that may immediately alter management Conclusions COVUS aims to maximize identification of the most immediately lifethreatening complications while minimizing time at bedside and provider risk of exposure to COVID19,,We evaluated coagulation abnormalities via traditional tests and rotational thromboelastometry ROTEM in a group of 94 patients with confirmed SARSCoV2 infection and different severity of pneumonia 34 moderate, 25 severe, 35 critical with the hypothesis that ROTEM parameters differed by coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 severity Shorter than normal clotting time CT and higher than normal maximum clot firmness MCF in extrinsic rotational thromboelastometry EXTEM and fibrinogen rotational thromboelastometry FIBTEM, shorter than normal EXTEM clot formation time CFT, and higher than normal αangle were classified as markers of hypercoagulable state Increment in the number of patients with 2 hypercoagulable parameters, higher EXTEM P  0001, FIBTEM MCF P  0001 and maximum lysis decrement P  002 with increment in disease severity was observed P  0001 Significant positive correlations between IL6 and CT EXTEM P  003, MCF EXTEM P  033, MCF FIBTEM P  01, and negative with ML EXTEM P  006 were seen Our findings based on analysis of different disease severity groups confirmed that a hypercoagulable ROTEM pattern characterized by clot formation acceleration, high clot strength, and reduced fibrinolysis was more frequent in advanced disease groups and patients with high IL6 These results supported the need for different thromboprophylaxis approaches for different severity groups,Introduction The lack of mechanical ventilators for patients with COVID19 has necessitated the use of other noninvasive ventilation NIV systems One of these NIV systems is the use of an adapted snorkel mask with inspiration valves and pressure valve PEEP Case and outcomes A 48yearold man with no previous history of lung disease was admitted to the emergency room with a diagnosis of acute respiratory failure due to SARSCOV2 The patient did not improve saturation with the use of the reservoir mask Oxygenation was started using an adapted snorkel mask with a PEEP valve with an alveolar recruitment function and double oxygen flow The patient presented clinical and radiological improvement after 2 days of use and was discharged 16 days later Discussion The use of a snorkel mask is an important, viable, and simpler NIV modality for the management of patients with COVID19 with respiratory failure who fail to use a reservoir mask, and it can be an alternative before the use of a mechanical ventilator Conclusion The use of the adapted snorkel mask with Charlotte valve and PEEP is a feasible alternative for the treatment of patients with COVID19,AIMS Chronic heart failure HF is a major comorbidity accounting for an increased severity and mortality related to coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 To reduce the risk of COVID19 in HF patients, telemedicine has been encouraged METHODS AND RESULTS During the COVID19 pandemic, telemedical management with mainly overthephone appointments became a major strategy of followup of our HF clinic patients Previously, the large majority of patients have been seen in the hospital with direct patientprovider contact We compared both strategies of followup, in prepandemic PPP and pandemic PP periods, regarding total mortality and hospitalizationsemergency department ED visits due to HF exacerbation We prospectively studied a cohort of 196 patients The mean followup time in PPP was 14xa0years In this period, 20 patients died In PP followup of 71xa0days, there was one additional death Total mortality in the first year of followup was 120, matching the mortality predicted by the MetaAnalysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure score Considering hospitalizationsED visits due to decompensated HF, there was no statistically significant difference between PPP and PP Only one patient was diagnosed with COVID19 CONCLUSIONS In the light of an increase in telemedical management of this cohort of HF patients, we were able to maintain a low rate of admissions due to HF decompensation, without an increment in mortality Regarding these results, we encourage the incremental use of telemedicine in HF patients in the context of this or future pandemics and also in situations in which physical consultation might not be possible due to logistic issues,The article describes the case of a hospitalized 58yearold female patient with a chronic dry cough and increased inflammation values Before hospital admission, the presence of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 was excluded by a normal chest X‑ray and two negative PCR tests on throat swabs On admission the only symptom was a dry cough with clinically inconspicuous auscultation findings The laboratory investigations revealed anemia and increased inflammation parameters, eg C‑reactive protein CRP 924u202fmgl and erythrocyte sedimentation rate ESR 102u202fmmh according to Westergren Axa0large vessel vasculitis was demonstrated on magnetic resonance angiography MRA After the diagnosis of axa0giant cell arteritis, treatment with an oral glucocorticoid and subcutaneous methotrexate MTX was initiated, with good clinical and laboratory parameter responses Dry cough has been described in rare cases in the literature as the first sign of large vessel vasculitis,BACKGROUND Krebs von den Lungen6 KL6 was suggested as ILD biomarker including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis IPF Lung cancer is one of the most severe comorbidity of IPF patients This study aims to serially analyze KL6 in IPF patients after 24 months of Nintedanib and to first investigate the biomarker behavior in IPF associated with adenocarcinoma MATERIALS AND METHODS One hundred and fortytwo ILD patients median IQR, 69 6375 years 86 males were retrospectively enrolled Serial serum samples were collected from IPF patients before starting antifibrotic therapy and after 12 months Serum KL6 levels were measured by KL6 reagent assay Fujirebio Europe, UK RESULTS Increased KL6 concentrations were identified in IPFLC patients than IPF, fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and pulmonary fibrosis associated with autoimmune disease groups A cutoff value was calculated to distinguish IPF and IPFLC patients IPF patients monitored for 24 months with Nintedanib showed persisted increased levels of KL6 with a progressive decline of FVC percentages CONCLUSION This preliminary study offers a first demonstration that very high serum concentrations of KL6 in IPFLC patients are associated with poor prognosis Moreover, serial evaluation of serum KL6 in IPF patients over 24 months of Nintedanib treatment revealed that most patients experienced a stabilization of lung function parameters and of serum concentrations of KL6,,,,,Background The COVID19 pandemic challenges our ability to safely treat breast cancer patients and requires revisiting current techniques to evaluate optimal strategies Potential longterm sequelae of breast radiation have been addressed by deep inspiration breathhold DIBH, prone positioning, and fourdimensional computed tomography 4DCT average intensity projection AveIPbased planning techniques Dosimetric comparisons to determine the optimal technique to minimize the normal tissue dose for leftsided breast cancers have not been performed Methods Ten patients with leftsided, earlystage breast cancer undergoing whole breast radiation were simulated in the prone position, supine with DIBH, and with a freebreathing 4DCT scan The target and organs at risk OAR contours were delineated in all scans Target volume coverage and OAR doses were assessed Oneway analysis of variance ANOVA and KruskalWallis oneway ANOVA were used to detect differences in dosimetric parameters among the different treatment plans Significance was set as p  005 Results We demonstrate differences in heart and lung dose by the simulation technique The mean heart doses in the prone, DIBH, and AveIP plans were 129 cGy, 154 cGy, and 262 cGy, respectively p002 The lung V20 in the prone, DIBH, and AveIP groups was 05, 103 and 95, respectively p 0001 Regardless of technique, lumpectomyxa0planning target volume PTV coverage did not differ between the three plans with 95 of the lumpectomy PTV volume covered by 1004 in prone plans, 985 in AveIP plans, and 993 in DIBH plans p07 Conclusions Prone positioning provides dosimetric advantages as compared to DIBH When infection risks are considered as in the current coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic, prone plans have advantages in reducing the risk of disease transmission In instances where prone positioning is not feasible, obtaining an AveIP simulation may be useful in more accurately assessing heart and lung toxicity and informing a riskbenefit discussion of DIBH vs free breathhold techniques,,,,The Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 virus spread from Wuhan, China, in 2019 and is spreading rapidly around the world COVID19 victims are almost associated with cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and other underlying diseases Concerning the high prevalence of these disorders, widespread mortality threatens global society, and its fatality rate may increase with increasing COVID19 prevalence in countries with older populations Therefore, evaluating patients clinical status with severe COVID19 infection and their medical history can help manage treatment Currently, one of the considered treatments is angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2 inhibition This study investigated virus entry mechanisms through membrane receptors, their role in the pathogenesis of COVID19 and underlying diseases, and treatment methods based on the viral entrance inhibition According to existing studies, inhibition of ACE2 can increase oxidative stress, inflammation, fibrosis and ultimately exacerbate underlying diseases such as cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, diabetes, and hypertension in individuals with COVID19 The ACE2 inhibition is not suitable for patients with COVID19 with underlying diseases, but it seems that the recombinant ACE2 solution is more appropriate for inhibiting the virus in these patients if hypotension would be monitored,The Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic has grown to be a global public health crisis with no safe and effective treatments available yet Recent findings suggest that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2, the coronavirus pathogen that causes COVID19, could elicit a cytokine storm that drives edema, dysfunction of the airway exchange, and acute respiratory distress syndrome in the lung, followed by acute cardiac injury and thromboembolic events leading to multiorgan failure and death Mesenchymal stem cells MSCs, owing to their powerful immunomodulatory abilities, have the potential to attenuate the cytokine storm and have therefore been proposed as a potential therapeutic approach for which several clinical trials are underway Given that intravenous infusion of MSCs results in a significant trapping in the lung, MSC therapy could directly mitigate inflammation, protect alveolar epithelial cells, and reverse lung dysfunction by normalizing the pulmonary microenvironment and preventing pulmonary fibrosis In this review, we present an overview and perspectives of the SARSCoV2 induced inflammatory dysfunction and the potential of MSC immunomodulation for the prevention and treatment of COVID19 related pulmonary disease,,,The WiSE system is a novel, leadless endocardial system that can provide cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients who cannot be treated with a conventional epicardial left ventricular lead Safety and efficacy was being evaluated in the pivotal, randomized, doubleblind SOLVECRT Trial Stimulation of the Left Ventricular Endocardium for Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy The trial was initiated in 2018 however, patient enrollment was significantly impacted by the COVID19 pandemic necessitating a change in design This paper describes the revised trial and the scientific rationale for the specific changes in the protocol,We thank Dr Kotnik and colleagues for their commentary on the American College of Rheumatologys clinical guidance for pediatric patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children MISC The use of anticoagulation in this population remains an intensely debated topic with little clinical evidence to guide treatment decisions For this reason, the task force was only able to achieve consensus on recommending anticoagulation in patients with larger coronary artery aneurysms CAAs zscore 10 and significant cardiac dysfunction ejection fraction  35 based on the wellestablished risk for thrombosis in patients with these clinical features1, 2,Background Nowadays, the new coronavirus SARSCoV2 and its complications are one of the main concerns of the world One of the most severe complications of COVID19 is hypoxemia Objectives This study aimed to assess the importance of happy hypoxemia in COVID19 Methods We systematically searched web of science, PubMed, and Google scholar databases to find articles related to COVID19 and happy hypoxemia Results COVID19 causes a type of hypoxemia named silent happy hypoxemia, which has an atypical clinical presentation This type of hypoxemia has not been noted before in viral pneumonia, and there is no specific treatment for this serious complication Patients with silent hypoxemia may develop severe hypoxemia without dyspnea and with nearnormal lung compliance These patients are awake, calm, and responsive Although their lungs are not oxygenated efficiently, they are alert and cooperative Their condition may be deteriorated rapidly without warning and causes death Conclusions According to the findings, paying attention to happy hypoxemia is important for improving the health status of COVID19 patients,Background Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 has resulted in a pandemic Early diagnosis of complications and mortality caused by this disease will guide the treatment process in patients with COVID19 Materials and methods In total, 102 adult patients 18 years who were followed up in the intensive care unit ICU between May and August 2020 because of COVID19 were included in this study Demographic data, comorbid diseases, and hematological parameters of the patients during admission to the ICU were examined Hematological parameters such as leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte, platelet counts, Creactive protein CRP, Ddimer, and lactate data were recorded Neutrophiltolymphocyte ratio NLR and fibrinogentoalbumin ratio FAR were calculated, and their effects on mortality were examined Results Of the patients, 71 696 were male and the mean age of all patients was 691  143 24103 years Comorbid diseases of the patients were as follows hypertension, 40 392 patients diabetes mellitus, 28 274 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 20 196 coronary artery disease, 14 137, heart failure, 4 39, and cerebrovascular disease, 3 29 Results showed that mortality was higher in patients with older age median age  72 range  6280 years, and bilateral infiltration was observed in lung computed tomography of all patients who died Mortality was higher in patients with NLR  916, FAR  015, Ddimer  201 mgL, CRP  116 mgdL, lactate  23 mmolL Conclusion During the hospitalization of patients with COVID19 to the ICU, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, hyperfibrinogenemia, high NLR, FAR, Ddimer, CRP, and lactate levels were found to be associated with mortality Keywords COVID19 Ddimer fibrinogentoalbumin ratio mortality factors neutrophiltolymphocyte ratio,,BACKGROUND Coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization WHO in March 2020 To further reveal the pathologic associations between coronavirus and hypoxemia, we report the findings of 4 complete systematic autopsies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2positive individuals who died of multiple organ failure caused by severe hypoxemia MATERIAL AND METHODS We examined the donated corpses of 4 deceased patients who had been diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 A complete postmortem examination was carried out on each corpse, and multiple organs were macroscopically examined RESULTS The 4 corpses were 2 males and 2 females, with an average age of 69 years Bilateral lungs showed various degrees of atrophy and consolidation, with diffusely tough and solid texture in the sections A thromboembolism was found in the main pulmonary artery extending into the atrium in 1 corpse, and significant atherosclerotic plaques tagged in the inner wall of the aortic arch were found in 2 corpses Two corpses were found to have slightly atrophied bilateral renal parenchyma Atrophic changes in the spleen were found in 2 corpses Notably, there were significantly expanded alveolar septa and prominent fibroblastic proliferation CONCLUSIONS The laboratory data of these corpses showed a progressive decrease in blood oxygen saturation, followed by refractory and irreversible hypoxemia Clinical and laboratory information and autopsy and histologic presentations of multiple organs showed insufficient air exchange due to abnormalities in the respiratory system, and reduced erythropoiesis in bone marrow may play a role,We aimed to investigate changes in pulmonary function and computed tomography CT findings in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 during the recovery period COVID19 patients underwent symptom assessment, pulmonary function tests, and highresolution chest CT 6 months after discharge from the hospital Of the 54 patients enrolled, 31 and 23 were in the moderate and severe group, respectively The main symptoms 6 months after discharge were fatigue and exertional dyspnea, experienced by 241 and 185 of patients, respectively, followed by smell and taste dysfunction 93 and cough 56 One patient dropped out of the pulmonary function tests Of the remaining 54 patients, 415 had pulmonary dysfunction Specifically, 75 presented with restrictive ventilatory dysfunction forced vital capacity 80 of the predicted value, 189 presented with small airway dysfunction, and 321 presented with pulmonary diffusion impairment diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide 80 of the predicted value Of the 54 patients enrolled, six patients dropped out of the chest CT tests Eleven of the remaining 48 patients presented with abnormal lung CT findings 6 months after discharge Patients with residual lung lesions were more common in the severe group 526 than in the moderate group 34 a higher proportion of patients had involvement of both lungs 421 vs 34 in the severe group The residual lung lesions were mainly groundglass opacities 208 and linear opacities 146 Semiquantitative visual scoring of the CT findings revealed significantly higher scores in the left, right, and both lungs in the severe group than in the moderate group COVID19 patients 6 months after discharge mostly presented with fatigue and exertional dyspnea, and their pulmonary dysfunction was mostly characterized by pulmonary diffusion impairment As revealed by chest CT, the severe group had a higher prevalence of residual lesions than the moderate group, and the residual lesions mostly manifested as groundglass opacities and linear opacities,,The General Data Protection Regulation GDPR became binding law in the European Union Member States in 2018, as a step toward harmonizing personal data protection legislation in the European Union The Regulation governs almost all types of personal data processing, hence, also, those pertaining to biomedical research The purpose of this article is to highlight the main practical issues related to data and biological sample sharing that biomedical researchers face regularly, and to specify how these are addressed in the context of GDPR, after consulting with ethicslegal experts We identify areas in which clarifications of the GDPR are needed, particularly those related to consent requirements by study participants Amendments should target the following 1 restricting exceptions based on national laws and increasing harmonization, 2 confirming the concept of broad consent, and 3 defining a roadmap for secondary use of data These changes will be achieved by acknowledged learned societies in the field taking the lead in preparing a document giving guidance for the optimal interpretation of the GDPR, which will be finalized following a period of commenting by a broad multistakeholder audience In parallel, promoting engagement and education of the public in the relevant issues such as different consent types or residual risk for reidentification, on both localnational and international levels, is considered critical for advancement We hope that this article will open this broad discussion involving all major stakeholders, toward optimizing the GDPR and allowing a harmonized transnational research approach,Sustained hypoxia normally induces a carotid body upregulation of AT1 receptor expression, increasing response to AngiotensinII3 However, ACE2 receptors blocked by CoV2 as their entry port could decrease AngiotensinII production Thereby, carotid body hypoxia sensing could be impaired This numbness interferes with normal pulmonarycardiovascular compensatory response Rapid progression to extreme hypoxia in COVID19 without initial shortness of breath and sudden death could ensue Following this hypothesis, incipient asymptomatic COVID19 patients with low pulse oximetry lt90 at sea level and lt80 in La Paz at 3,600m can be diagnosed before temperature rise Early treatment could avoid progression Pulse oximetry in public places is recommended,,Postmortem computed tomography PMCT is axa0rapid and noninvasive diagnostic tool for important contributions to the identification of pulmonary findings in the deceased with pneumonia, including cases of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 Although computed tomography CT shows axa0high sensitivity for pneumonia in living persons, it is relatively unspecific for COVID19 pneumonia clinically Typical CT findings for viral pneumonia therefore require confirmation by PCR tests polymerase chain reaction tests, even if lung infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 SARSCoV2 show characteristic patterns, most frequently ground glass opacities GGO and axa0combination of GGO and air space consolidationsIn the consecutive autopsy series of SARSCoV‑2 deaths from Hamburg, Germany, the most frequent cause of death was and still is COVID19 pneumonia Typical findings were frequently found in the PMCT in SARSCoV2associated deaths, which were taken into account when classifying the death as COVID19,BACKGROUND Although it is known that the new coronavirus disease COVID19, which was first seen in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has affected the whole world, mainly targets the respiratory tract, cases of this disease with a wide clinical spectrum are emerging as information is shared CASE REPORT We present the case of a pregnant woman who was diagnosed with venous sinus thrombosis after she developed headache and hemiparesis Polymerase chain reaction PCR positivity lasted for two weeks after COVID19 had been diagnosed CONCLUSIONS In patients with suspected COVID19, especially in the presence of causes of hypercoagu lability and presence of atypical features, venous sinus thrombosis needs to be kept in mind in making the differential diagnosis,BACKGROUND Lungs are the primary organ of involvement of COVID19, and the severity of pneumonia in COVID19 patients is an important cause of morbidity and mortality AIM We aimed to evaluate the visual and quantitative pneumonia severity on chest computed tomography CT in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 and compare the CT findings with clinical and laboratory findings METHODS We retrospectively evaluated adult COVID19 patients who underwent chest CT, clinical scores, laboratory findings, and length of hospital stay Two independent radiologists visually evaluated the pneumonia severity on chest CT VSQS Quantitative CT QCT assessment was performed using a free DICOM viewer, and the percentage of the wellaerated lung WAL, highattenuation areas HAA at different threshold values, and mean lung attenuation MLA values were calculated The relationship between CT scores and the clinical, laboratory data, and length of hospital stay were evaluated in this crosssectional study The students ttest and chisquare test were used to analyze the differences between variables The Pearson correlation test analyzed the correlation between variables The diagnostic performance of the variables was assessed using receiver operating characteristic ROC analysis was used RESULTS The VSQS and QCT scores were significantly correlated with procalcitonin, ddimer, ferritin, and Creactive protein levels Both VSQ and QCT scores were significantly correlated with disease severity p0001 Among the QCT parameters, the HAA600 value showed the best correlation with the VSQS r730,p0001 VSQS and QCT scores had high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing disease severity and predicting prolonged hospitalization CONCLUSION The VSQS and QCT scores can help manage the COVID19 and predict the duration of hospitalization,OBJECTIVE Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 SARSCoV2 is the etiologic agent of the current, worldwide coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2 is the SARSCoV2 host entry receptor for cellular inoculation and target organ injury We reviewed ACE2 expression and the role of ACE2  angiotensin 17 Mas receptor axis activity in abdominal aortic aneurysm AAA pathogenesis to identify potential COVID19 influences on AAA disease pathogenesis METHODS A comprehensive literature search was performed on PubMed, National Library of Medicine, USA Key words included COVID19, SARSCoV2, AAA, ACE2, ACE or angiotensin II type 1 AT1 receptor inhibitor, angiotensin 17, Mas receptor, age, gender, respiratory diseases, diabetes, autoimmune diseases Key publications on the epidemiology and pathogenesis of COVID19 and AAAs were identified and reviewed RESULTS All vascular structural cells, including endothelial and smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts and pericytes express ACE2 Cigarette smoking, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lupus, certain types of malignancies and viral infection promote ACE2 expression and activity, with the magnitude of response varying by sex and age Genetic deficiency of AT1 receptor, or pharmacological ACE or AT1 inhibition also increases ACE2 and its catalytic product angiotensin 17 Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of ACE2 or Mas receptor augments, whereas ACE2 activation or angiotensin 17 treatment attenuates, progression of experimental AAAs Potential influences of SARSCoV2 on AAA pathogenesis include augmented ACEangiotensin IIAT1 receptor activity resulting from reduced reciprocal ACE2angiotensin 17Mas activation increased production of proaneurysmal mediators stimulated by viral spike proteins in ACE2negative myeloid cells or by ACE2expressing vascular structural cells augmented local or systemic crosstalk between viral targeted nonvascular, nonleukocytic ACE2expressing cells via ligand recognition of their cognate leukocyte receptors and hypoxemia and increased systemic inflammatory tone experienced during severe COVID19 illness CONCLUSION COVID19 may theoretically influence AAA disease through multiple SARSCoV2induced mechanisms Further investigation and clinical followup will be necessary to determine whether and to what extent the COVID19 pandemic will influence the prevalence, progression and lethality of AAA disease in the coming decade,Coronavirus disease pandemic has caused a dramatic reduction of elective and urgent interventional cardiology procedures, with a negative impact on training of interventional cardiology fellows This study showed that 95 of interventional cardiology fellows during the first wave of the COVID‐19 pandemic believe that their training would be moderately or severely impacted by the health crisis Interventional cardiology programs need to reorganize in order to ensure safe pathways for both urgent and elective cases, primarily for patients care but also to grant an adequate caseload for trainees,BACKGROUND The Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic is having a major global impact, and the resultant response in the development of new diagnostics is unprecedented The detection of antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 has a role in managing the pandemic We evaluated the feasibility of using SARSCoV2 peptide Kode Technologymodified red cells C19kodecytes to develop an assay compatible with existing routine serologic platforms STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS A panel of eight unique red cells modified using Kode Technology functionspacerlipid constructs and bearing short SARSCoV2 peptides was developed C19kodecyte assay Kodecytes were tested against undiluted expected antibodynegative and positive plasma samples in manual tube and three column agglutination technology CAT platforms Parallel analysis with the same peptides in solid phase by enzyme immunoassays was performed Evaluation samples included 120 expected negative blood donor samples and 140 COVID19 convalescent plasma samples, with independent serologic analysis from two centers RESULTS Specificity negative reaction rate against expected negative samples in three different CAT platforms against novel C19kodecytes was 91, which correlated with published literature Sensitivity positive reaction rate against expected positive convalescent, PCRconfirmed samples ranged from 82 to 97 compared to 77 with the Abbott Architect SARSCoV2 IgG assay Manual tube serology was less sensitive than CAT Enzyme immunoassay results with some Kode Technology constructs also had high sensitivity CONCLUSIONS C19kodecytes are viable for use as serologic reagent red cells for the detection of SARSCoV2 antibody with routine blood antibody screening equipment,,Sepsis and autoimmune diseases remain major causes of morbidity and mortality The last decade has seen a new appreciation of platelets in host defense, in both immunity and thrombosis Platelets are first responders in the blood to microbes or nonmicrobial antigens The role of platelets in physiologic immunity is counterbalanced by their role in pathology, for example, microvascular thrombosis Platelets encounter microbes and antigens via both innate and adaptive immune processes platelets also help to shape the subsequent adaptive response FcγRIIA is a receptor for immune complexes opsonized by IgG or pentraxins, and expressed in humans by platelets, granulocytes, monocytes and macrophages With consideration of the roles of IgG and Fc receptors, the host response to microbes and autoantigens can be called adaptive immunothrombosis Here we review newer developments involving platelet FcγRIIA in humans and humanized mice in immunity and thrombosis, with special attention to heparininduced thrombocytopenia HIT, systemic lupus erythematosus SLE and bacterial sepsis Human genetic diversity in platelet receptors and the utility of humanized mouse models are highlighted,Since March 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 has been declared a pandemic, which has been on escalation Blood urea nitrogen BUN has been considered to be an independent risk factor for ,One year into the Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2, effective treatments are still needed 13  Monoclonal antibodies, given alone or as part of a therapeutic cocktail, have shown promising results in patients, raising the hope that they could play an important role in preventing clinical deterioration in severely ill or in exposed, high risk individuals 46  Here, we evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic effect of COVA118 in vivo , a neutralizing antibody isolated from a convalescent patient 7 and highly potent against the B117 isolate 8,9  In both prophylactic and therapeutic settings, SARSCoV2 remained undetectable in the lungs of COVA118 treated hACE2 mice Therapeutic treatment also caused a dramatic reduction in viral loads in the lungs of Syrian hamsters When administered at 10 mg kg u20091 one day prior to a high dose SARSCoV2 challenge in cynomolgus macaques, COVA118 had a very strong antiviral activity in the upper respiratory compartments with an estimated reduction in viral infectivity of more than 95, and prevented lymphopenia and extensive lung lesions Modelling and experimental findings demonstrate that COVA118 has a strong antiviral activity in three different preclinical models and could be a valuable candidate for further clinical evaluation,INTRODUCTION Patients undergoing evaluation for an inherited arrhythmia syndrome undertake a series of ambulatory investigations including 24h Holter monitor, exercise treadmill testing ETT, and others Patch monitors may simplify the evaluation, providing accurate arrhythmia evaluation and QT assessment METHODS AND RESULTS Patients referred for evaluation of an inherited arrhythmia syndrome underwent standard investigations, including 12lead electrocardiography ECG, 24h Holter monitoring, ETT, along with supplemental monitoring using a 7day ECG patch monitor Heart rates HR, corrected QT intervals QTc, and ectopic burden were compared across monitoring modalities Among 35 patients that wore the patch monitor, the median age was 39 years 54 male There was intermediate correlation between resting HR across modalities ru2009u20095866 and poor correlation of peak HR ru2009u20092739 There was intermediate correlation between resting QTc intervals across modalities ru2009u20097277 but negligible correlation between QTc intervals at peak HR across modalities ru2009u200901 to 06 There was good correlation in PAC and PVC ectopic burden across the Holter and patch monitor CONCLUSION Patch monitors may simplify the evaluation of patients for an inherited arrhythmia syndrome and provide resting QT assessment over time However, QTc interval comparison at peak HRs remains variable, and may be limited by the singlelead ECG vector when using the patch monitor Apart from QTc intervals at peak HR, patch monitors demonstrated good correlation with the ECG and Holter monitor for other parameters,Background Shape memory polymers are materials that are manufactured in a certain shape, can be stored in a temporary deformed shape, and then return to  or remember  their original shape upon exposure to external stimuli such as temperature and moisture This property lends itself to application in endovascular medical devices Peripheral vasculature embolisation devices incorporating this novel technology have become commercially available and this case series, where the data were collected as part of a post market registry, outlines initial clinical experience with these novel devicesResults Eight cases are described in this series The disease stateconditions for which embolisation was indicated were right common iliac artery aneurysms n  3, a type II endoleak into the thoracic aorta following thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair n  1, a left inferior gluteal artery aneurysm n  1, left internal iliac artery aneurysms n  2, and a case of splenomegaly, where splenectomy was planned after the embolisation procedure n  1 Target arteries were 510 mm in diameter In each case, at least one IMPEDE Embolization Plug of an appropriate diameter was used All procedures were technically successful and target vessel thrombosis was achieved in all cases Followup imaging available during the 4590day data collection timeframe showed sustained vessel occlusion This case series includes examples of situations commonly encountered when embolising the peripheral vasculature, namely, the use of one or multiple devices in a single vessel and in combination with the use of other embolic devices eg, microcoils, gelatin sponge, and PVA particles in the same case There were no adverse events related to the specific use of the deviceConclusions This small series illustrates the safety and efficacy of this novel spongebased embolic device for the embolisation of small and medium sized arteries and further experience will demonstrate the utility of the shape memory polymer devices,Increasing data have accumulated on the role of Cardiac Computed Tomography CCT in infective endocarditis IE with high accuracy for large vegetations, perivalvular complications and for exclusion of coronary artery disease to avoid invasive angiography CCT can further help to clarify the etiology of infective prosthetic valve dysfunction eg malposition, abscess, leak, vegetation or mass Structural interventions have increased the relevance of CCT in valvular heart disease and have amplified its use CCT may be ideally integrated into a multimodality approach that incorporates a central role of transesophageal echocardiography TEE with 18FDG PET andor cardiac magnetic resonance in individually selected cases, guided by the Heart Team The coronavirus19 COVID19 pandemic has resulted in renewed attention to CCT as a safe alternative or adjunct to TEE in selected patients This review article provides a comprehensive, contemporary review on CCT in IE to include scan optimization, characteristics of common IE findings on CCT, published data on the diagnostic accuracy of CCT, multimodality imaging comparison, limitations and future technical advancements,Objective The purpose of this article is to review the cases of myocarditis in COVID19 patients and synthesize the current understanding regarding the presentation, diagnosis, and management of myocarditis in the setting of COVID19 disease Background The novel coronavirus disease has shown serious implications for the cardiovascular system, including acute myocardial injury, arrhythmias, venous thromboembolism, and myocarditis Several cases of myocarditis in COVID19 patients have been reported since the diseases emergence at the end of 2019 The diagnostic approach and management have been variable The purpose of this narrative review is to gather the most reliable published material regarding myocarditis in COVID19 and present it as an overview to simplify the current understanding we have of this disease Methods We screened PubMed, Scopus, and Embase We then selected peerreviewed and preprint articles published in English that were related to the involvement of the cardiovascular system in COVID19, with a focus on myocarditis We included case reports describing myocarditis in COVID19 patients and summarized their clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management References of the selected articles were also screened, and some were included when relevant Discussion This article is subdivided into sections that discuss the clinical presentation of COVID19 myocarditis and move on to various diagnostic approaches and management options Each subsection presents a brief literature review followed by a summary and interpretation of what was found in the reported cases Conclusion After noticing the involvement of the cardiovascular system in COVID19 patients, specifically through myocarditis, we present this narrative review to provide the medical community with a unified article regarding the current understanding of myocarditis in COVID19 patients This article further stresses the necessity of establishing proper treatment guidelines for COVID19 myocarditis,Since December 2019, the novel coronavirus SARSCoV2 pandemic COVID19 outbroke in Wuhan and spread in China Here we aimed to investigate the clinical and radiological characteristics of COVID19 cases We collected and analyzed the clinical data of 172 hospitalized cases of COVID19 who were diagnosed via qRTPCR of nasopharyngeal swabs during January 2020 and February 2020 The chest images were reviewed by radiologists and respirologists The older patients with COVID19 in Henan Province had more severe disease and worse prognosis The male sex, smoking history and Wuhan exposure of patients are not related to the severity or prognosis of COVID19 Family gatherings were showed among 267 of patients A greater proportion of patients in the severe group suffer from combined chronic diseases CT results showed that most patients had bilateral lung lesions and multiple lung lobes The lungs of severe patients are more damaged Both the infection range and inflammatory factor levels are related to the poor prognosis Antiviral drugs, immunoglobulin and traditional Chinese medicine are mainly used for the treatment of COVID19 patients The discharge rate of COVID19 patients was 930, and the mortality rate was 23 Case type, lymphocyte ratio grade, and respiratory failure at admission are risk factors for poor prognosis, except for the number of infiltrating lung lobes The results showed that severe disease process, lymphopenia and respiratory failure are risk factors for the COVID19,The aim is to promote a safer intervention in a cardiac arrest assisted by a sports professional during the current pandemic conditions due to COVID19 The European Resuscitation Council protocol for lay people is adequate for this group, but it must be complemented with the use of personal protective equipment PPE adapted to sports professionals The adaptations of action with respect to the 2015 practical guidelines are assessment of breathing visually without opening the victims airways, placement of a mask preferably FFP2 on the victim before starting resuscitation, resuscitation only with chest compressions except for of children and drownedcohabitant, and the use of PPE for the sports field of easy learning and greater safety against possible transmission of COVID19 by dropsaerosols FFP3, glasses, gloves These considerations should be included in the trainingretraining of sports professionals in resuscitation and sports entities should favor the availability of aforementioned PPE,,Introduction Omalizumab is used to treat severe uncontrolled allergic asthma and chronic spontaneous urticaria CSU, and is approved for selfadministration in prefilled syringes It is thus important to understand the advantages, critical issues, and indications for home administrationAreas covered The present review summarizes the available evidence on home administration of omalizumab in asthma and CSU to illustrate the advantages derived from selfadministration of patients in this settingExpert opinion The available data suggest that patients can safely administer biologics at home with suitable training, and that home administration is time saving and costeffective The majority of patients with severe asthma or CSU treated with omalizumab are likely to be suitable candidates for selfadministration, which can be proposed to anyone that the clinician deems suitable In addition to clinicians, pharmacists can also play a key role in managing patients who are prescribed home administration A practical flow chart is proposed on selection of patients and their management during home administration Selfadministration of biologics can be considered as a valid alternative to traditional injections in a clinical setting, and the evidence has shown that no major issues need to be overcome in terms of safety or efficacy,Tweetable abstract eHealth and ArtificialIntelligence AI bring new possibilities for HeartFailure HF care We elaborate on potential benefits of AI in HF and highlight important bottlenecks for its implementation Editorial Cardiology,Abstract  Background Phase III clinical trials have explored wholelung lowdose radiotherapy LDRT as a potential treatment for patients with COVID19related acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS Initial findings require reproduction Concomitant LDRT administration with existing therapies requires safety evaluation   Methods Patients with COVID19related pneumonia receiving dexamethasone andor remdesevir were treated with 15 Gy wholelung LDRT, followed for 28 days or until hospital discharge, and compared to controls blindly matched by age, comorbidity, and disease severity Eligible patients were hospitalized, SARSCoV2 positive, had radiographic consolidations, and required supplemental oxygen Endpoints included safety, clinical recovery, intubation, radiographic changes, and biomarker response   Findings 20 patients received wholelung LDRT between Jun 11 and Dec 7, 2020 and were compared to controls Freedom from intubation improved from 68 in controls to 86 following LDRT p009 as did Creactive protein CRP p002 and creatine kinase CK p001 levels, consistent with prior report Eighty percent of LDRT patients experienced rapid decline in CRP within 3 days and were classified as LDRT responders Intubationfree survival 100 vs 66, p001 and oxygenation loads were lower in LDRT responders compared to matched controls 32 lower per individual p003 and 56 lower for the cohort p006 No patient whose CRP declined following LDRT died or required intubation, whereas all LDRT nonresponders died Observed reduction of prolonged recoveries and hospitalization times did not reach significance Radiographic changes were equivalent   Interpretation  A cohort of patients with COVID19related ARDS treated with LDRT demonstrated superior freedom from intubation compared to matched controls, especially LDRT responders p001 LDRT appears safe to deliver with concurrent drugs LDRT lowered CRP and CK biomarkers CRP response predicted favorable outcome Optimal timing for LDRT after oxygen dependence but before intubation may extinguish immunopathology prior to systemic spread Confirmatory clinical trials are warranted Clinical Trial Registration NCT04366791     Funding None,Adipose tissue, in particular epicardial adipose tissue, has been identified as a potential biomarker of cardiovascular pathologies such as coronary artery disease CAD in the light of its metabolic activity and close anatomic and pathophysiologic relationship to the heart Our purpose was to evaluate epicardial adipose tissue density at both unenhanced and contrastenhanced computed tomography CT, along with CT densities of paracardiac and subcutaneous adipose tissue, as well as the relations of such densities with CAD We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent cardiac CT at our institution for CAD assessment We segmented regions of interest on epicardial, paracardiac, and subcutaneous adipose tissue on unenhanced and contrastenhanced scans A total of 480 patients were included, 164 of them presenting with CAD Median epicardial adipose tissue density measured on contrastenhanced scans 815 HU interquartile range 849 to 780 was higher than that measured on unenhanced scans 734 HU 769 to 694 p  0001, whereas paracardiac and subcutaneous adipose tissue densities were not p  0055 Patients with or without CAD, did not show significant differences in density of epicardial, paracardiac, and subcutaneous adipose tissue either on unenhanced or contrastenhanced scans p  0092 CAD patients may experience different phenomena inflammation, fibrosis, increase in adipose depots leading to rises or drops in epicardial adipose tissue density, resulting in variations that are difficult to detect,,Background Influenza virus infections are a key cause of communityacquired pneumonia CAP Cardiovascular events CVEs are common among CAP and influenza patients, but there have been few populationbased studies of influenzarelated pneumonia Flup patients published to date Methods A retrospective analysis of 1191 immunocompetent hospitalized adult Flup patients fromxa0January 2012  December 2018 in five teaching hospitals in China was conductedResults A total of 246 2931191 of patients developed at least one form of CVErelated complication while hospitalization In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, coronary artery disease, preexisting heart failure, systolic blood pressure  90 mmHg, respiratory rates  30 breathsmin, a lymphocyte count  08×109L, PaO2FiO2  300 mmHg, systemic corticosteroid administration, early neuraminidase inhibitor treatment, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitorsangiotensin II receptor blocker treatment were independently associated with the risk of CVEs After controlling for potential confounding variables, we determined that CVEs were linked to a higher risk of 30day mortality OR 3307, 95 CI 21984975, p  0001 in Flup patients Conclusions CVErelated complications are common among hospitalized Flup patients, and are associated with negative patient outcomes Clarifying these CVErelated risk factors can aid in their clinical prevention and care,Abstract Despite the widespread adoption of primary percutaneous intervention and modern antithrombotic therapy, STsegment elevation myocardial infarction STEMI remains the leading cause of death in the United States and remains one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide Certain highrisk patients present a challenge for diagnosis and treatment The widespread adoption of primary percutaneous intervention in addition to modern antithrombotic therapy has resulted in substantial improvement in the short and longterm prognosis following STEMI In this review, we aim to provide a brief analysis of the stateoftheart treatment for patients presenting with STEMI, focusing on cardiogenic shock, current treatment and controversies, cardiac arrest, and diagnosis and treatment of mechanical complications, as well as multivessel and left mainrelated STEMI,BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 has spread worldwide determining a dramatic impact on the healthcare system Aim of this study is to evaluate midterm clinical impact of COVID19 on respiratory function METHODS 379 patients were evaluated 4u2005months after SARSCOV2 diagnosis Patients were divided in two groups based on the presence of pneumonia during COVID Clinical conditions, quality of life, symptomatology, 6min walking test, pulmonary function test with spirometry and diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide were analysed Data were compared to clinical evolution during COVID development of acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS, needing of invasive mechanical ventilation IMV, partial oxygen saturation fraction of inspired oxygen SpO2FiO2 ratio and pneumonia severity index PSI RESULTS After a median of 135u2005days, 260 686 of 379 patients referred almost one symptom Patients who developed pneumonia during COVID19 showed lower SpO2 at rest p0001, SpO2 during 6min walking test p0001, total lung capacity p0001, airway occlusion pressure after 01u2005s P01 p002, P01maximal inspiratory pressure MIP ratio p0005 and higher Borg categoryratio scale p0006 and modified Medical Research Council breathlessness scale p0003, compared to patients without pneumonia SpO2FiO2 ratio and PSI during SARSCOV2 pneumonia were directly associated with midterm alteration of partial oxygen saturation at rest p0001, SpO2 during 6min walking test p0001, residual volume p0001, total lung capacity respectively p0001 and p0003 and forced vital capacity respectively p0004, p003 CONCLUSION Lung damage during COVID19 correlates to the reduction of pulmonary function after 4u2005months from acute infection,BACKGROUND A high proportion of COVID19 patients were reported to have cardiac involvements Data pertaining to cardiac sequalae is of urgent importance to define subsequent cardiac surveillance METHODS We performed a systematic cardiac screening for 97 consecutive COVID19 survivors including electrocardiogram ECG, echocardiography, serum troponin and NTproBNP assay 14 weeks after hospital discharge Treadmill exercise test and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging CMR were performed according to initial screening results RESULTS The mean age was 465  186 years 536 were men All were classified with nonsevere disease without overt cardiac manifestations and did not require intensive care Median hospitalization stay was 17 days and median duration from discharge to screening was 11 days Cardiac abnormalities were detected in 423 including sinus bradycardia 299, newly detected Twave abnormality 82, elevated troponin level 62, newly detected atrial fibrillation 10, and newly detected left ventricular systolic dysfunction with elevated NTproBNP level 10 Significant sinus bradycardia with heart rate below 50 bpm was detected in 72 COVID19 survivors, which appeared to be selflimiting and recovered over time For COVID19 survivors with persistent elevation of troponin level after discharge or newly detected T wave abnormality, echocardiography and CMR did not reveal any evidence of infarct, myocarditis, or left ventricular systolic dysfunction CONCLUSION Cardiac abnormality is common amongst COVIDsurvivors with mild disease, which is mostly selflimiting Nonetheless, cardiac surveillance in form of ECG andor serum biomarkers may be advisable to detect more severe cardiac involvement including atrial fibrillation and left ventricular dysfunction,The global SARSCoV2 pandemic starting in 2019 has already reached more than 23xa0million deaths Despite the scientific communitys efforts to investigate the COVID19 disease, a drug for effectively treating or curing patients yet needs to be discovered Hematopoietic stem cells HSC differentiating into immune cells for defense express COVID19 entry receptors, and COVID19xa0infection hinders their differentiation The importance of purinergic signaling in HSC differentiation and innate immunity has been recognized The metabotropic P2Y14 receptor subtype, activated by UDPglucose, controls HSC differentiation and mobilization Thereon, the exacerbated activation of blood immune cells amplifies the inflammatory state observed in COVID19 patients, specially through the continuous release of reactive oxygen species and extracellular neutrophil traps NETs Further, the P2Y14 subtype, robustly inhibits the infiltration of neutrophils into various epithelial tissues, including lungs and kidneys Here we discuss findings suggesting that antagonism of the P2Y14 receptor could prevent the progression of COVID19induced systemic inflammation, which often leads to severe illness and death cases Considering the modulation of neutrophil recruitment of extreme relevance for respiratory distress and lung failure prevention, we propose that P2Y14 receptor inhibition by its selective antagonist PPTN could limit neutrophil recruitment and NETosis, hence limiting excessive formation of oxygen reactive species and proteolytic activation of the kallikreinkinin system and subsequent bradykinin storm in the alveolar septa of COVID19 patientsGraphical Abstract,BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is still ongoing throughout the world and has resulted in considerable fatality Inflammation and cardiac injury are commonly observed in these cases However, the association between the hyperinflammatory response and cardiac injury among patients with COVID19 remains unknown METHODS The study was designed based on severe and critically ill patients with COVID19 Information on demographics and baseline clinical characteristics as well as laboratory examinations were collected from the electronic medical records and analyzed RESULTS There were 324 nu202fu202f107 of patients presenting with cardiac injury The median age was 67 years, and 488 nu202fu202f161 of patients were men Hypertension was the most common in 161 488 patients, followed by diabetes 167, nu202fu202f55 and coronary heart disease 133, nu202fu202f44 Moreover, compared to cases without cardiac injury, those with cardiac injury were older, had higher proportions of coronary heart disease, had significantly elevated leukocyte counts and concentrations of Nterminal proBType natriuretic peptide, highsensitivity Creactive protein hsCRP, tumor necrosis factor TNFα, interleukin2 receptor IL2R, IL6, and IL8, but lower lymphocyte counts A significant positive correlation was observed between highsensitivity troponin I and hsCRP, TNFα, IL2R, IL6 and IL8 Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that hsCRP, TNFα and IL6 were independent risk factors for cardiac injury CONCLUSIONS Proinflammatory cytokines were associated with cardiac injury among severe and critically ill patients with COVID19, suggesting that hyperinflammatory response may involve in cardiac injury,BACKGROUND Recent studies have demonstrated a complex interplay between comorbid cardiovascular disease, COVID19 pathophysiology, and poor clinical outcomes Coronary artery calcification CAC may therefore aid in risk stratification of COVID19 patients METHODS Noncontrast chest CT studies on 180 COVID19 patientsxa0xa0age 21 admitted from March 1, 2020 to April 27, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed by two radiologists to determine CAC scores Following feature selection, multivariable logistic regression was utilized to evaluate the relationship between CAC scores and patient outcomes RESULTS The presence of any identified CAC was associated with intubation AOR 36, CI 1496 and mortality AOR 32, CI 1479 Severe CAC was independently associated with intubation AOR 40, CI 1313 and mortality AOR 51, CI 1915 A greater CAC score UOR 12, CI 10213 and number of vessels with calcium UOR 13, CI 10216 was associated with mortality Visualized coronary stent or coronary artery bypass graft surgery CABG had no statistically significant association with intubation AOR 19, CI 0477 or death AOR 34, CI 1012 CONCLUSION COVID19 patients with any CAC were more likely to require intubation and die than those without CAC Increasing CAC and number of affected arteries was associated with mortality Severe CAC was associated with higher intubation risk Prior CABG or stenting had no association with elevated intubation or death,Objectives A novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2, is causing the worldwide coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 outbreak with high mortality A unique finding among COVID19 patients was a decline of eosinophil levels eosinopenia However, results from previous studies on the relationship between eosinopenia and disease severity were inconsistent The objective of this study is to determine the relationship between eosinopenia and COVID19 mortality as well as the clinical conditions that could potentially lead to mortality Methods One hundred ninety patients diagnosed as moderate, severe, or critical COVID19 at hospital admission were enrolled Data collected from patients medical records on the second day after hospital admission included medical histories, clinical symptoms, chest images of computed tomography CT, laboratory examinations, and outcomes Results Eosinophil levels were significantly lower in patients with critical disease, when compared to those with moderate and severe diseases After controlled for confounding factors, ie, age, gender, hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes, and chronic lung disease, a progressive decline of eosinophil levels was independently associated with mortality Moreover, eosinophil levels significantly and positively correlated with platelet and Ddimer levels but significantly and inversely correlated with serum levels of urea, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase Conclusions Eosinopenia, if progressively worsening, indicates that COVID19 patients may progress to critical disease and have a significantly higher chance of mortality Additionally, eosinopenia correlates with biomarkers of coagulation disorder and those of tissue damage in kidney, liver, and other tissues,OBJECTIVES To perform a comprehensive clinic, laboratory, and instrumental evaluation of children affected by coronavirus disease COVID19 METHODS Children with a positive result of nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 underwent laboratory tests, anal and conjunctival swab, electrocardiography, lung, abdomen, and cardiac ultrasound Twentyfourhour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed if abnormal basal blood pressure Patients were followedup for 6 months RESULTS Three hundred and sixteenxa0children were evaluated 15 were finally included Confirmed family member SARSCoV2 infection was present in all Twentyseven percent were asymptomatic Anal and conjunctival swabs tests resulted negative in all Patients with lower body mass indexxa0BMI presented significantly higher viral loads Main laboratory abnormalities were lactate dehydrogenase increasing 73, low vitamin D levels 87, hematuria 33, proteinuria 26, renal hyperfiltration 33, and hypofiltration 13 Two of the patients with hyperfiltration exhibited high blood pressure levels at diagnosis, and persistence of prehypertension at 6month followup No abnormalities were seen at ultrasound, excepting for one patient who exhibited Blines at lung sonography Immunoglobulin G seroconversion was observed in all at 1month CONCLUSIONS Our study confirm that intrafamily transmission is important The significant higher viral loads recorded among patients with lower BMI, together with low vitamin D levels, support the impact of nutritional status on immune system Renal involvement is frequent even among children with mild COVID19, therefore prompt evaluation and identification of patients with reduced renal function reserve would allow a better stratification and management of patients Seroconversion occurs also in asymptomatic children, with no differences in antibodies titer according to age, sex and clinical manifestations,OBJECTIVE To evaluate pulmonary function and clinical symptoms in coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 survivors within 3u2005months after hospital discharge, and to identify risk factors associated with impaired lung function METHODS AND MATERIAL COVID19 patients were prospectively followed up with pulmonary function tests and clinical characteristics for 3u2005months following discharge from a hospital in Wuhan, China between January and February 2020 RESULTS 647 patients were included 87 13 patients presented with weakness, 63 10 with palpitation and 56 9 with dyspnea Prevalences of the three symptoms were markedly higher in severe patients than nonsevere patients 19 versus 10 for weakness, p0003 14 versus 7 for palpitation, p0007 12 versus 7 for dyspnea, p0014 Results of multivariable regression showed an increased odd in the ongoing symptoms among severe patients OR 17, 95CI 1126, p0026 or patients with longer hospital stay OR 103, 95CI 100105, p0041 Pulmonary function test results were available for 81 patients, including 41 nonsevere and 40 severe patients In this subgroup, 44 54 patients manifested abnormal diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide DLCO 68 severe versus 42 nonsevere patients, p0019 Chest CT total severity score TSS105 OR 104 95CI 25441 p0001 on admission and ARDS OR 46 95CI 14155 p0014 were significantly associated with impaired DLCO Pulmonary interstitial damage may be associated with abnormal DLCO CONCLUSION Pulmonary function, particularly DLCO, declined in COVID19 survivors This decrease was associated with TSS of chest CT 105 and ARDS occurrence Pulmonary interstitial damage might contribute to the imparied DLCO,BackgroundCOVID19 is considered axa0systemic disease Axa0severe course with fatal outcome is possible and unpredictableObjectivesWhich organ systems are predominantly involved Which diseases are predisposed for axa0fatal course Which organ changes are found with lethal outcomeMaterials and methodsData from published autopsy studies 28xa0cases by our group with respect to organ changes and possible cause of deathResultsThe most severe alterations are found in the lungs by diffuse alveolar damage as axa0symptom of an acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS, in part with fibrosis Thrombosis of small to midsized pulmonary arteries is associated with hemorrhagic lung infarction Frequent complications are bacterial pneumonias and less frequently fungal pneumonias by aspergillus Pulmonary thromboembolism is found in 2030 of lethal courses, also in the absence of deep venous thrombosis Intestinal involvement of COVID19 can be associated with intestinal ischemia, caused by shock or local thrombosis In most cases, the kidneys display acute tubular injury reflecting acute renal failure, depletion of lymphocytes in the lymph nodes and spleen, and hyperplastic adrenal glands The liver frequently reveals steatosis, liver cell necrosis, portal inflammation, and proliferation of Kupffer cells Important preexisting diseases in autopsy studies are arterial hypertension with hypertensive and ischemic cardiomyopathy and diabetes mellitus but large populationbased studies reveal increased risk of mortality only for diabetes mellitus not for arterial hypertensionConclusionsAlterations of the pulmonary circulation with pulmonary arterial thrombosis, infarction, and bacterial pneumonia are important and often lethal complications of COVID19associated ARDS Findings from autopsy studies have influenced therapy and prophylaxis,Strict monitoring of the heart rhythm in patients with COVID‐19 even nonsevere case and patient with low cardiovascular risk factors is very important to prevent fatal outcomes Strict monitoring of the heart rhythm in patients with COVID‐19 even nonsevere case and patient with low cardiovascular risk factors is very important to prevent fatal outcomes,In December 2019, severe acute

regarding its cardiac side effects CASE PRESENTATION We report the case of a 36yearold male hospitalized due to severe COVID19 symptoms He presented with a 10day history of fever up to 397 °C, productive cough, hemoptysis, fatigue, myalgias and hypoxemia The patient received supplemental oxygen, dexamethasone, remdesivir and empirical antibiotic treatment according to protocol Asymptomatic sinus bradycardia developed on hospital day 3 namely, heart rate 39min compared to 92min on admission Secondary causes of bradycardia were excluded based on the absence of relevant evidence from laboratory workup and echocardiographic examination The patients rhythm restored to normal 9 days after the discontinuation of remdesivir CONCLUSIONS Considering the frequent use of remdesivir in patients with COVID19, physicians should be aware of this possible adverse event,Thermohumidified nasal high flow NHF oxygen therapy is increasingly used in the management of respiratory failure This therapy has recently gained attention as an alternative noninvasive respiratory support in several clinical scenarios, including acute and chronic settings NHF enhances the patients comfort and tolerance when compared with standard oxygen by supplying a heated and humidified mixture of air and oxygen at flows up to 60Lmin It can be delivered through different devices Although few studies have compared the clinical effects of different NHF systems, the purpose of this paper is to describe the major benefits of NHF and to provide a quick guide on how to implement this therapy in daily practice We have also included a brief description of the most frequently used NHF systems,Low vitamin D serum or plasma 25hydroxyvitamin D 25OHD is a global pandemic and associates with a greater prevalence in allcause and cardiovascular mortality and morbidity Openheart surgery is a form of acute stress that decreases circulating 25OHD concentrations and exacerbates the preponderance of low vitamin D in a patient population already characterized by low levels Although supplemental vitamin D increases 25OHD, it is unknown if supplemental vitamin D can overcome the decreases in circulating 25OHD induced by openheart surgery We sought to identify if supplemental vitamin D protects against the acute decrease in plasma 25OHD propagated by openheart surgery during perioperative care Participants undergoing openheart surgery were randomly assigned doubleblind to one of two groups a vitamin D nxa0xa075 cholecalciferol, 50,000xa0IUdose or b placebo nxa0xa075 Participants received supplements on three separate occasions orally the evening before surgery and either orally or per nasogastric tube on postoperative days 1 and 2 Plasma 25OHD concentrations were measured at baseline the day before surgery and before the first supplement bolus, after surgery on postoperative days 1, 2, 3, and 4, at hospital discharge 58xa0days after surgery, and at an elective outpatient followup visit at 6xa0months Supplemental vitamin D abolished the acute decrease in 25OHD induced by openheart surgery during postoperative care Moreover, plasma 25OHD gradually increased from baseline to day 3 and remained significantly increased thereafter but plateaued to discharge with supplemental vitamin D We conclude that perioperative vitamin D supplementation protects against the immediate decrease in plasma 25OHD induced by openheart surgery ClinicalTrialsgov Identifier NCT02460211,Abstract While molecular targeted therapies have improved prognoses of advanced stage lung adenocarcinoma expressing oncogenic driver mutations, acquired therapeutic resistance continues to be a major problem Epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR activating mutations are among the most common targetable genetic alterations in lung adenocarcinoma, and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors TKIs are recommended firstline therapy for EGFR mutation positive cancer patients Unfortunately, most patients develop resistance to EGFR TKIs and rapid disease progression occurs A better mechanistic understanding of therapy refractory cancer progression is necessary to develop new therapeutic approaches to predict and prevent acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs Here, we identify a new mechanism of ERBB3mediated resistance to EGFR TKIs in human lung adenocarcinoma Specifically, we show that dopamine and cyclic AMPregulated phosphoprotein, Mr 32000 DARPP32 physically recruits ERBB3 to EGFR to mediate a switch from EGFR homodimers to EGFRERBB3 heterodimers to bypass EGFR TKImediated inhibition to potentiate ERBB3dependent activation of oncogenic AKT and ERK signaling that drives therapy refractory tumor cell survival In a cohort of paired tumor specimens derived from 30 lung adenocarcinoma patients before and after the development of EGFR TKI refractory disease progression, we reveal that DARPP32 as well as kinaseactivated EGFR and ERBB3 proteins are overexpressed upon acquired EGFR TKI resistance In vivo studies suggest that ablation of DARPP32 protein activity sensitizes gefitinibresistant lung tumor xenografts to EGFR TKI treatment, while DARPP32 overexpression increases gefitinibrefractory lung cancer progression in gefitinibsensitive lung tumors orthotopically xenografted into mice Taken together, our findings introduce a DARPP32mediated, ERBB3dependent mechanism used by lung tumor cells to evade EGFR TKIinduced cell death, potentially paving the way for the development of new therapies to prevent or overcome therapyrefractory lung adenocarcinoma progression,Underlying chronic respiratory disease may be associated with the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 This study investigated the impact of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD on the risk for respiratory failure and mortality in COVID19 patients A nationwide retrospective cohort study was conducted in 4610 patients u200940xa0years old infected with COVID19 between January 20 and May 27, 2020, using data from the Ministry of Health and Welfare and Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service in Korea The clinical course and various clinical features were compared between COPD and nonCOPD patients, and the risks of respiratory failure and allcause mortality in COPD patients were analyzed using a multivariate logistic regression model Among 4610 COVID19 patients, 4469 969 and 141 31 were categorized into the nonCOPD and COPD groups, respectively The COPD group had greater proportions of older u200960xa0years old 780 vs 452, P,PurposeThe increasing tendency of chest CT usage throughout the COVID19 epidemic requires new tools and a systematic scheme for diagnosing and assessing the lung involvement in Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID19 To investigate the use of the COVID19 Reporting and Data System CORADS classification and chest CT Involvement Score CTIS in COVID19 pneumoniaMaterial and methodsThis retrospective study enrolled 280 hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID19 pneumonia in a tertiary hospital in Turkey All patients underwent noncontrast CT chest imaging Two radiologists interpreted all CT images according to CORADS classification without knowing the clinical features, laboratory findings We used CT involvement score CTIS for assessing chest CT images of COVID19 patients Also, we examined the relationship between CTIS and clinical outcomes in COVID19 patientsResultsOf the patients, 111396 had positive realtime reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction RTPCR results CORADS 5 group patients had statistically significant positive RTPCR results than the other groups P,Abstract  Background severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 or Covid19 is a nationwide public health emergency with significant impact on human life   Objective To develop a new simple hematological prognostic index for Covid19 severity state   Patients and methods This observational cross sectional study was conducted on 250 patients with Covid19 disease Age, gender, and severity of Covid 19 were recorded Complete blood count and lactate dehydrogenase were measured New index COVID19 severityIraqiindex  CSI index to predict COVID19 severity CSI index is monocytelymphocyte absolute counts multiplied by LDH lactate dehydrogenaseupper normal reference laboratory range of LDH value   Results Mean age of patients was 504  151 years Majority of patients were Males 148 592Most of patients were in stage 2 and 3  94 There was a significant difference between means of White Blood Cells, lymphocytes and Monocytes among the different stages of the disease P  00001, 0036, 0012 There was a significant moderate correlation between the prognostic index and the stage of the disease r041, p00001   Conclusions CSI index is a new simple predictor of clinical outcome in patients with covid19 during early stage of the disease,Cause and mechanisms of persistent dyspnoea after recovery from COVID19 are not well described The objective is to describe causal factors for persistent dyspnoea in patients after COVID19 We examined patients reporting dyspnoea after recovery from COVID19 by cardiopulmonary exercise testing After exclusion of patients with preexisting lung diseases, ten patients mean age 50131 years were retrospectively analysed between May 14th and September 15th, 2020 On chest computed tomography, five patients showed residual ground glass opacities, and one patient showed streaky residua A slight reduction of the mean diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide was noted in the cohort Mean peak oxygen uptake was reduced with 1512232 mlmin 727 predicted, while mean peak work rate was preserved with 13129 W 924 predicted Mean alveolararterial oxygen gradient AaDO2 at peak exercise was 256118 mmHg Mean value of lactate post exercise was 5618 mmoll A gap between peak work rate in 924 predicted to peak oxygen uptake 723 pred was detected in our study cohort Mean value of lactate post exercise was high in our study population and even higher ns compared to the subgroup of patients with reduced peak oxygen uptake and other obvious reason for limitation Both observations support the hypothesis of anaerobic metabolism The main reason for dyspnoea may therefore be muscular,BACKGROUND Nasal High Flow NHF therapy delivers flows of heated humidified gases up to 60 LPM litres per minute via a nasal cannula Particles of oralnasal fluid released by patients undergoing NHF therapy may pose a crossinfection risk, which is a potential concern for treating COVID19 patients METHODS Liquid particles within the exhaled breath of healthy participants were measured with two protocols 1 high speed camera imaging and counting exhaled particles under high magnification 6 participants and 2 measuring the deposition of a chemical marker riboflavin5monophosphate at a distance of 100 and 500 mm on filter papers through which air was drawn 10 participants The filter papers were assayed with HPLC Breathing conditions tested included quiet resting breathing and vigorous breathing which here means nasal snorting, voluntary coughing and voluntary sneezing Unsupported natural breathing and NHF at 30 and 60 LPM were compared RESULTS Imaging During quiet breathing, no particles were recorded with unsupported breathing or 30 LPM NHF detection limit for single particles 33 μm Particles were detected from 2 of 6 participants at 60 LPM quiet breathing at approximately 10 of the rate caused by unsupported vigorous breathing Unsupported vigorous breathing released the greatest numbers of particles Vigorous breathing with NHF at 60 LPM, released half the number of particles compared to vigorous breathing without NHFChemical marker tests No oralnasal fluid was detected in quiet breathing without NHF detection limit 028 μLm3 In quiet breathing with NHF at 60 LPM, small quantities were detected in 4 out of 29 quiet breathing tests, not exceeding 17 μLm3 Vigorous breathing released 2001000 times more fluid than the quiet breathing with NHF The quantities detected in vigorous breathing were similar whether using NHF or not CONCLUSION During quiet breathing, 60 LPM NHF therapy may cause oralnasal fluid to be released as particles, at levels of tens of μL per cubic metre of air Vigorous breathing snort, cough or sneeze releases 200 to 1000 times more oralnasal fluid than quiet breathing p  0001 with both imaging and chemical marker methods During vigorous breathing, 60 LPM NHF therapy caused no statistically significant difference in the quantity of oralnasal fluid released compared to unsupported breathing NHF use does not increase the risk of dispersing infectious aerosols above the risk of unsupported vigorous breathing Standard infection prevention and control measures should apply when dealing with a patient who has an acute respiratory infection, independent of which, if any, respiratory support is being used CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION ACTRN12614000924651,The rapid advancement of the COVID19 pandemic has prompted an accelerated pursuit to identify effective therapeutics Stages of the disease course have been defined by viral burden, lung pathology, and progression through phases of the immune response Immunological factors including inflammatory cell infiltration and cytokine storm have been associated with severe disease and death Many immunomodulatory therapies for COVID19 are currently being investigated, and preliminary results support the premise of targeting the immune response However, because suppressing immune mechanisms could also impact the clearance of the virus in the early stages of infection, therapeutic success is likely to depend on timing with respect to the disease course Azithromycin is an immunomodulatory drug that has been shown to have antiviral effects and potential benefit in patients with COVID19 Multiple immunomodulatory effects have been defined for azithromycin which could provide efficacy during the late stages of the disease, including inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine production, inhibition of neutrophil influx, induction of regulatory functions of macrophages, and alterations in autophagy Here we review the published evidence of these mechanisms along with the current clinical use of azithromycin as an immunomodulatory therapeutic We then discuss the potential impact of azithromycin on the immune response to COVID19, as well as caution against immunosuppressive and offtarget effects including cardiotoxicity in these patients While azithromycin has the potential to contribute efficacy, its impact on the COVID19 immune response requires additional characterization so as to better define its role in individualized therapy,,,,Uncontrolled immune system activation amplifies endorgan injury in hypertension Nonetheless, the exact mechanisms initiating this exacerbated inflammatory response, thereby contributing to further increases in blood pressure BP, are still being revealed While participation of lymphoidderived immune cells has been well described in the hypertension literature, the mechanisms by which myeloidderived innate immune cells contribute to T cell activation, and subsequent BP elevation, remains an active area of investigation In this article, we critically analyze the literature to understand how monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, including mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils, contribute to hypertension and hypertensionassociated endorgan injury The most abundant leukocytes, neutrophils, are indisputably increased in hypertension However, it is unknown how and why they switch from critical first responders of the innate immune system, and homeostatic regulators of BP, to tissuedamaging, prohypertensive mediators We propose that myeloperoxidasederived prooxidants, neutrophil elastase, neutrophil extracellular traps NETs, and interactions with other innate and adaptive immune cells are novel mechanisms that could contribute to the inflammatory cascade in hypertension We further posit that the gut microbiota serves as a set point for neutropoiesis and their function Finally, given that hypertension appears to be a key risk factor for morbidity and mortality in COVID19 patients, we put forth evidence that neutrophils and NETs cause cardiovascular injury postcoronavirus infection, and thus may be proposed as an intriguing therapeutic target for highrisk individuals © 2021 American Physiological Society Compr Physiol 1115751589, 2021,Mesenchymal stromal cells MSCs, also known as mesenchymal stem cells, have been intensely investigated for clinical applications within the last decades However, the majority of registered clinical trials applying MSC therapy for diverse human diseases have fallen short of expectations, despite the encouraging preclinical outcomes in varied animal disease models This can be attributable to inconsistent criteria for MSCs identity across studies and their inherited heterogeneity Nowadays, with the emergence of advanced biological techniques and substantial improvements in bioengineered materials, strategies have been developed to overcome clinical challenges in MSC application Here in this review, we will discuss the major challenges of MSC therapies in clinical application, the factors impacting the diversity of MSCs, the potential approaches that modify MSC products with the highest therapeutic potential, and finally the usage of MSCs for COVID19 pandemic disease,Background After one year since emerging from Wuhan, China, the Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic is still raging worldwide Still, there is a dearth of original research exploring the attributes of COVID19 patients from lowerand middleincome countries, such as Bangladesh Based on a case series from a tertiary healthcare center, this observational study has explored the epidemiological and clinical profile of COVID19 patients in Dhaka, Bangladesh A total of 422 COVID19 confirmed patients via Reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction test were enrolled in this study We have compiled patients medical records and reported their demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical features, treatment history, health outcome, and postdischarge complications descriptivelyResult Patients were predominantly male 64, between 35 to 49 years 28, with at least one comorbidity 52, and had COVID19 symptoms for one week before hospitalization 66 A significantly higher proportion P005 of male patients had diabetes, hypertension, and ischemic heart disease, while females had a significantly higher proportion P005 of asthma The most common symptoms were fever 80, cough 60, dyspnea 41, and sore throat 21 Most patients received antibiotics 77 and anticoagulant therapy 56 and stayed in the hospital for an average of 12 days Over 90 of patients were successfully weaned, while 3 died from COVID19, and 41 reported complications after dischargeConclusion The diversity of clinical and epidemiological characteristics and health outcomes of COVID19 patients across age groups and gender is noteworthy Our result will inform the clinicians and epidemiologists of Bangladesh of their COVID19 mitigation effort,Abstract  Funding Acknowledgements Type of funding sources None   Background The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization WHO on 11 March 2020 xa0Clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic to acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS that can lead to deathxa0Patients with concomitant cardiac diseases have an extremely poor prognosis,xa0and SARSCoV2 may cause direct acute and chronic damage to the cardiovascular systemxa0Echocardiography may provide useful information, especially in critical care patients, because it can be performed quickly at the bedside However, the recommendations relating to the use of echocardiography in the COVID19 pandemic must be considered only as expert suggestions due to the lack of evidencebased scientific outcome data To date, there is no means to predict the impact of the virus on patient outcome probably because the pathophysiology of COVID19 remains unexplained   Purpose To assess the prognostic utility of quantitative 2Dechocardiography, including strain, in patients with COVID19 disease   Methods COVID19 patients admitted to the San Paolo University Hospital of Milan, that underwent a clinically indicated echocardiographic exam were included in the study To limit contamination all measurements were performed offline Quantitative measurements were obtained by an operator blinded to the clinical data   Results Among the 49 patients, nonsurvivors 33 had worse respiratory parameters, index of multiorgan failure and worse markers of lung involvement Right Ventricular RV dysfunction as assessed by conventional and 2dimensional speckle tracking, fig 1 was a common finding and a powerful independent predictor of mortality At the ROC curve analyses, RV freewall longitudinal strain LS showed an AUC 077  008 in predicting death, p  0008, and global RV LS RVGLS showed an AUC 079  004, p  0004 This association remained significant after correction for age OR 116, 95CI 101134, p  0029 for RV freewall LS and OR  120, 95CI 101142, p  0033 for RVGLS, for oxygen partial pressure at arterial gas analysisfraction of inspired oxygen OR 128, 95CI 104157, p

freewall LS, and OR  130, 95CI 104163, p  0022 for RVGLS   Conclusions Inxa0patients hospitalized with COVID19, offline quantitative 2Dechocardiographic assessment of cardiac function is feasible Parameters of RV function are frequently abnormal and have an independent prognostic value over markers of lung involvementxa0Early identification of RV dysfunction with speckle tracking might be useful not only to guide management acutely ie fluid management, monitoring highPEEP response in intubated patientsxa0but also to tailor followup subsequently Abstract Figure 1,Abstract  Funding Acknowledgements Type of funding sources None Aims To describe the role of coronary CT angiography CCTA as the sole available noninvasive diagnostic test for symptomatic patients with suspected CAD in a hub center for cardiovascular emergencies in the presence of limited access to hospital facilities during the COVID19 pandemic Methods and Results From March 9th to April 30th, during the peak of the COVID19 pandemic, a consecutive cohort of symptomatic patients with high clinical suspicion of CAD and clinical indication to CCTA were enrolled in a hub hospital in Milan, Italy When obstructive coronary artery disease was detected 70 diameter stenosis in a proximal coronary segment or 90 stenosis in any coronary segment patients were referred to invasive coronary angiography ICA Clinical followup was assessed in patients in whom ICA was considered deferrable Overall, 58 consecutive patients were included Ten 172 symptomatic patients underwent ICA according to CCTA findings, while in 48 828 patients ICA was deferred No clinical events were recorded after a mean followup of 497  168 days In nine out of ten patients referred to ICA, severe coronary artery disease was confirmed and treated accordingly Changes in medical therapy were significantly more prevalent in patients with vs those without CAD at CCTA   Conclusion We report a potential pivotal role for CCTA in the triage of nonCOVID19 patients with suspectedxa0 CAD during the SARSCoV2 pandemic CCTA may be helpful for identifying patients who necessitate ICA, ensuring adequate resource utilization during the pandemic,For over 30xa0years, our TE has processed, controlled for quality and distributed cryopreserved allograft valves for human application We present a review of this activity and future perspectives of cardiovascular tissue banking The donor age and medicalbehavioral history are in compliance with the regulations of the EUMS Allograft morphology and function are evaluated in a class A cleanroom Tests for viralbacterial infection, histological control of structureinfectionmalignancy and controlrate cryopreservation are performed A total of 7562 hearts were sent to our TE, whereas 7290 valves pulmonary, aortic and mitral were transplanted The donations increased over time 1934, 2566 and 3062 hearts were donated during the first, second and third decades increases of 327 and 193 during the second and third decades Likewise, there was a significant increase in transplantations with 2050, 2550 and 2690 valves implanted during the first, second and third decades 244 and 55 increase during the second and third decades A total of 4475 pulmonary 614, 2760 aortic 379 and 55 mitral valves 07 were transplanted Outstanding longterm results in adults and evidence of immunerelated deterioration of allografts in neonates and infants were demonstrated Decellularization was suggested as a solution One hundred pulmonary and 180 aortic valves were sent for transplantation after decellularization for the ESPOIR and ARISE clinical trials and beyond The donation and transplantation activity increased progressively Although cryopreserved valves represent the best substitute for diseased valves, accelerated failure appears after implantation in neonates and infants The implementation of new technologies, such as decellularization, as a standard procedure for treatment of allograft valves will offer further improvements in allograft quality and increase of durability,Treating patients hospitalised with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD usually involves administering systemic corticosteroids The many unwanted side effects associated with this treatment have led to increased interest in minimising the accumulated corticosteroid dose necessary to treat exacerbations Studies have shown that shortterm treatment with corticosteroids is preferred, and recent trials have shown that biomarkers can be used to further reduce exposure to corticosteroids Interestingly, high eosinophil counts in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD are indicative of an eosinophilic phenotype with a distinct response to treatment with corticosteroids In addition, posthoc analysis of randomised control trials have shown that higher blood eosinophil counts at the start of the study predict a greater response to inhaled corticosteroids in stable COPD In this review, we examine the studies on this topic, describe how blood eosinophil cell count may be used as a biomarker to guide treatment with corticosteroids, and identify some relevant challenges,Normal haemostasis is an important physiological mechanism that prevents excessive bleeding during trauma, whereas the pathological thrombosis especially in diabetics leads to increased incidence of heart attacks and strokes as well as peripheral vascular events In this work, we propose a new multiscale framework that integrates seamlessly four key components of blood clotting, namely transport of coagulation factors, coagulation kinetics, blood cell mechanics and platelet adhesive dynamics, to model the development of thrombi under physiological and pathological conditions We implement this framework to simulate platelet adhesion due to the exposure of tissue factor in a threedimensional microchannel Our results show that our model can simulate thrombinmediated platelet activation in the flowing blood, resulting in platelet adhesion to the injury site of the channel wall Furthermore, we simulate platelet adhesion in diabetic blood, and our results show that both the pathological alterations in the biomechanics of blood cells and changes in the amount of coagulation factors contribute to the excessive platelet adhesion and aggregation in diabetic blood Taken together, this new framework can be used to probe synergistic mechanisms of thrombus formation under physiological and pathological conditions, and open new directions in modelling complex biological problems that involve several multiscale processes,Cystic fibrosis CF is a genetic disease caused by a mutations in the CF transmembrane regulator CFTR, where progressive decline in lung function due to recurring exacerbations is a major cause of mortality The initiation of chronic obstructive lung disease in CF involves inflammation and exacerbations, leading to mucus obstruction and lung function decline Even though clinical management of CF lung disease has prolonged survival, exacerbation and agerelated lung function decline remain a challenge for controlling the progressive lung disease The key to the resolution of progressive lung disease is prognosisbased early therapeutic intervention thus, the development of novel diagnostics and prognostic biomarkers for predicting exacerbation and lung function decline will allow optimal management of the lung disease Hence, the development of realtime lung function diagnostics such as forced oscillation technique FOT, impulse oscillometry system IOS, and electrical impedance tomography EIT, and novel prognosisbased intervention strategies for controlling the progression of chronic obstructive lung disease will fulfill a significant unmet need for CF patients Early detection of CF lung inflammation and exacerbations with the timely resolution will not only prolong survival and reduce mortality but also improve quality of life while reducing significant health care costs due to recurring hospitalizations,The coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 became a pandemic and a global health emergency The SARSCoV2 receptor angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2 is highly expressed in nasal epithelial cells and plays a major role in cellular entry leading to infection High expression of ACE2 has been suggested to be a potential risk factor for virus infection and disease severity However the profile of ACE2 gene expression in diseases of the upper airways remains poorly understood We herein investigated ACE2 gene expression in the nasal tissues of a cohort of Swedish patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps CRSwNPs using RTqPCR ACE2 mRNA expression was significantly reduced in the nasal mucosa of CRSwNP patients compared to that of controls Moreover, we observed a sexdependant difference in nasal ACE2 expression, where significantly lower levels of the ACE2 transcript were detected in the nasal mucosa of only female CRSwNP patients These findings indicate that CRSwNP patients with a decrease in ACE2 gene expression may thereby be less prone to be infected by SARSCoV2 These results enhance our understanding on the profile of ACE2 expression in the nasal mucosa of patients with upper airway diseases, and their susceptibility to infection with SARSCoV2,BACKGROUND In all chronic airway diseases, the dynamics of airway function are influenced by underlying airway inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness along with limitations in reversibility owing to airway and lung remodeling as well as mucous plugging The relative contribution of each component translates into specific clinical patterns of symptoms, quality of life, exacerbation risk, and treatment success OBJECTIVE We aimed to evaluate whether subgrouping of patients with obstructive airway diseases according to patterns of fluctuation in lung function allows identification of specific phenotypes with distinct clinical characteristics METHODS We applied the novel method of fluctuationbased clustering FBC to twicedaily FEV1 measurements recorded over a 1year period in a mixed group of 134 adults with mildtomoderate asthma, severe asthma, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from the European BIOAIR cohort RESULTS Independently of clinical diagnosis, FBC divided patients into 4 fluctuationbased clusters with progressively increasing alterations in lung function that corresponded to patterns of increasing clinical severity, risk of exacerbation, and lower quality of life Clusters of patients with airway disease with significantly elevated levels of biomarkers relating to remodeling osteonectin and cellular senescence plasminogen activator inhibitor1, accompanied by a loss of airway reversibility, pulmonary hyperinflation, and loss of diffusion capacity, were identified The 4 clusters generated were stable over time and revealed no differences in levels of markers of type 2 inflammation blood eosinophils and periostin CONCLUSION FBCbased phenotyping provides another level of information that is complementary to clinical diagnosis and unrelated to eosinophilic inflammation, which could identify patients who may benefit from specific treatment strategies or closer monitoring,OBJECTIVE Sleep complaints are frequent after acute COVID19 Aim of this study was to videopolysomnographically evaluate sleep and sleep disorders after SARSCov2 infection METHODS Patients with suspected sleep disorders after acute COVID19 underwent videopolysomnography vPSG at the Sleep Disorders Clinic, Department of Neurology, Medical University Innsbruck VPSG was conducted 42 SDxa0xa013 months after diagnosis of SARSCoV2 infection RESULTS Eleven patients nine men, age 525 SDxa0xa0117 years BMI 29 SDxa0xa052 kgm2 were included At 60 days followup after diagnosis, persisting breathing complaints were present in 711 64 patients After vPSG four patients 36 were diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea OSA Respiratory frequency during sleep was normal and no tachypnea, thoracoabdominal asynchrony, or periodic deep sighing were detected Four patients 36 showed REM sleep without atonia RWA, and two additional patients showed an RWA index within the highest range of normality CONCLUSION We report videopolysomnographic findings in a series of eleven patients after acute COVID19 A major finding of this study was the presence of isolated RWA, a recognized prodromal stage of RBD, in more than one third of the patients Future videopolysomnographic investigations including quantification of RWA in patients after COVID19 will give more insights into a possible acute or postinfectious CNS pathology related to the SARSCoV2 infection,AIM Several studies reported the accompaniment of severe COVID19 with comorbidities However, there is not a systematic evaluation of all aspects of this association Therefore, this metaanalysis aimed to assess the association between all underlying comorbidities in COVID19 infection severity METHODS Electronic literature search was performed via scientific search engines After the removal of duplicates and selection of articles of interest, 28 studies were included A fixedeffects model was used however, if heterogeneity was high I2  50 a randomeffects model was applied to combine the data RESULTS A total of 6,270 individuals were assessed 1,615 severe and 4,655 nonsevere patients The median age was 63 95 confidence interval CI 4974 and 47 95 CI 1963 years in the severe and nonsevere groups, respectively Moreover, about 41 of patients had comorbidities Severity was higher in patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease OR 485 95 CI 311757 The odds of being in a severe group increase by 481 95 CI 343674 for a history of cardiovascular disease CVD This was 419 95 CI 284619 for chronic lung disease and 318, 95 CI 209482 for cancer The odds ratios of diabetes and hypertension were 261 95 CI 20233 and 237 95 CI 180313, respectively CONCLUSIONS The presence of comorbidities is associated with severity of COVID19 infection The strongest association was observed for cerebrovascular disease, followed by CVD, chronic lung disease, cancer, diabetes, and hypertension,Acute aortic dissection and acute pulmonary embolism PE are lifethreatening emergencies that can mimic each other at presentation Immediate and accurate diagnosis of these scenarios is crucial to initiate the appropriate interventions In this case report we present a 73yearold patient, who was admitted to our Medical Center with acute type A aortic dissection She was tested for coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 infection and was found to be positive During her admission in the COVID19 designated intensive care unit, she diagnosed with acute PE in the main right and left pulmonary arteries She underwent surgery that included bilateral pulmonary embolectomy and aortic dissection repair The patient was discharged from our hospital on the ninth postoperative day without any complications Frequency of simultaneous presentation of acute aortic dissection and acute PE is increased with a history of coagulation abnormalities as seen in patients with COVID19,,Some patients with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 experienced sudden death because of sudden symptom deterioration Thus, an alarm system that could detect early signs of COVID19 exacerbation beforehand, to prevent serious illness or death of patients while receiving outpatient treatment at home or in hotels is necessary Here, we tested whether estimated oxygen variations EOV, a relative physiological scale that represents users blood oxygen saturation level during sleep measured by Fitbit, predicted COVID19 symptom exacerbation Study period was from August to November 2020 We enrolled 23 COVID19 patients diagnosed by SARSCoV2 polymerase chain reactionpositive mean age  standard deviation, 509  20 years 70 female, let each patient wore the Fitbit for 30 days COVID19 symptoms were exacerbated in 6 26 High EOV signal a patients oxygen level exhibits significant dip and recovery within the index period had 80 sensitivity before symptom exacerbations, whereas resting heart rate signal only had 50 sensitivity Coincidental obstructive sleep apnea syndrome confirmed by polysomnography was detected in a patient by consistently high EOV signals This pilot study successfully detected early COVID19 symptoms exacerbation by measuring EOV and may help to identify early signs of COVID19 exacerbation,,The reduction of care for acute coronary syndrome during the COVID19 pandemic is recognized We describe a case of a patient with dextrocardia and situs solitus, a rare condition that occurs in adults in up to 1900 thousand cases, admitted due to acute coronary syndrome in the context of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation Some of the particularities of the congenital condition are described, such as epidemiology, associated structural abnormalities, and the strategy to perform the examination, as well as the discussion of antiaggregation and anticoagulation therapies, given the concomitance with arrhythmia,No abstract available Article truncated after 150 words Clinical Scenario A 59yearold woman with hypothyroidism presented to the emergency room with progressive shortness of breath for 2 weeks Upon arrival, she was markedly hypoxic necessitating use of a nonrebreather to maintain her oxygen saturations above 88 A chest radiograph demonstrated extensive, bilateral airspace disease She was diagnosed with SARSCoV2 COVID19 pneumonia and started on the appropriate therapies Approximately 48 hours into her hospitalization, she required intubation with mechanical ventilation due to her progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure She was intubated for approximately 5 weeks with a gradual improvement in her respiratory status, but not to the point where she was a candidate for a tracheostomy Despite being off sedation for an extended period, she remained unresponsive A CT of the head without contrast did not demonstrate any significant abnormalities An MRI of the brain was subsequently performed and demonstrated diffuse juxtacortical and callosal white matter microhemorrhages Figure 1 Given …,Olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions OGD are a frequent symptom of Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 It has been proposed that the neuroinvasive potential of the novel SARSCoV2 could be due to olfactory bulb invasion, conversely studies suggest it could be a good prognostic factor The aim of the current study was to investigate the prognosis value of OGD in COVID19These symptoms were recorded on admission from a cohort study of 5868 patients with confirmed or highly suspected COVID19 infection included in the multicenter international HOPE Registry NCT04334291There was statistical relation in multivariate analysis for OGD in gender, more frequent in female 1241 vs 867 in male, related to age, more frequent under 65 years, presence of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, smoke, renal insufficiency, lung, heart, cancer and neurological disease We did not find statistical differences in pregnant p0505, patient suffering cognitive p0484, liver p01 or immune disease p032 There was inverse relation protective between OGD and prone positioning 0005 and death 00001, but no with ICU 0165 or mechanical ventilation 0292 On univariable logistic regression OGD was found to be inversely related to death in COVID19 patients The Odds Ratio was 026 015044 p0001 and Z was 505The presence of anosmia is fundamental in the diagnosis of SARSCoV2 infection, but also could be important when classifying patients and in therapeutic decisions Even more knowing that it is an early symptom of the disease Knowing that other situations as being AfroAmerican or LatinoAmerican, Hypertension, renal insufficiency, or increase of Creactive protein CRP imply a worse prognosis we can make a clinical score to estimate the vital prognosis of the patientThe exact pathogenesis of SARSCoV2 that causes olfactory and gustative disorders remains unknown but seems related to the prognosis This point is fundamental, insomuch as could be a plausible way to find a treatment,BACKGROUND Many studies have shown that participation in cardiac rehabilitation reduces longterm morbidity and mortality after myocardial infarction Therefore, both American and European evidencebased guidelines recommend cardiac rehabilitation However, it is still unclear what the optimal dose of cardiac rehabilitation is METHODOLOGY The study is a monocenter, retrospective cohort study We identified patients with stable ischemic heart disease, who participated in at least one phase II centerbased cardiac rehabilitation session between 2010 and 2015 A total of 609 patients were included in this study RESULTS We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 609 patients Statistically significant baseline differences between the four groups were observed for index coronary artery revascularization technique, age, dual antiplatelet therapy and smoking status A total of number of 84 patients 138 had a MACE in the fouryear followup period After adjustment for all significant predictors in the univariate analysis, patients who attended 36 or more sessions had a 47 lower risk of MACE hazard ratio HR, 054 95 confidence interval CI, 031 to 092, patients who attended 24 to 35 sessions had a 68 lower risk of MACE hazard ratio HR, 032 95 confidence interval CI, 015 to 067, patients who attended 12 to 23 sessions had a 56 lower risk of MACE hazard ratio HR, 044 95 confidence interval CI, 021 to 092 than those who attended 1 to 11 sessions CONCLUSION There is a clear clinical benefit from participating in more than 11 CR sessions The best outcomes are achieved in patient who participated between 24 and 35 CR sessions These results underline again the importance of improving participation and adherence to CR programmes in Europe,Asthma is a chronic disease with major public health ramifications owing to its high morbidity and mortality rates, especially in severe and recurrent cases Conventional therapeutic options could partially alleviate the burden of asthma, yet a novel approach is needed to completely control this condition To do so, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying asthma is essential to recognize and treat the major pathways that drive its pathophysiology In this review, we will discuss the molecular mechanism of asthma, in particular focusing on the type of inflammatory responses it elicits, namely type 2 and nontype 2 asthma Furthermore, we will discuss the novel therapeutic options that target the aberrant molecules found in asthma pathophysiology We will specifically focus on the role of novel monoclonal antibody therapies recently developed, such as the antiIgE, IL5, IL5Rα, and IL4Rα antibodies, drugs that have been extensively studied preclinically and clinically,Biocides are commonly used as spray or triggertype formulations, thus dermal and respiratory exposure to biocide aerosol is unavoidable However, little is known about the impact of aerosolization on the local toxicity of biocides on the skin or the airway We compared the local toxicity of biocides after direct or aerosol exposure on reconstructed human skin epidermis and upper airway models Three biocides, 1,2benzisothiazol32Hone BIT, 2phenoxyethanol PE, and 2phenylphenol OPP, most widely used in the market were selected When the biocide was treated in aerosols, toxicity to the skin epidermis and upper airway tissue became significantly attenuated compared with the direct application as determined by the higher tissue viabilities This was further confirmed in histological examination, wherein the tissue damages were less pronounced LCMSMS and GCMS analysis revealed that concentrations of biocides decreased during aerosolization Importantly, the toxicity of biocides treated in 3 μm median mass aerodynamic diameter MMAD aerosols was stronger than that of 5 μm aerosol, suggesting that the aerosol particle size may affect biocide toxicity Collectively, we demonstrated that aerosolization could affect the local toxicity of biocides on the skin epidermis and the upper airway,OBJECTIVE Despite evidencebased Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease GOLD recommendations, outcomes are poor GOLD uses chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD assessment test CAT scores with exacerbation history to categorize COPD severity into A, B, C, and D severity groups Therapy is groupspecific monotherapydual longacting bronchodilators LABDs therapy is preferred to inhaled corticosteroids ICS Pharmacistaccessible data could be used to identify evidencebased interventions to improve outcomes The primary objective was to analyze previously collected data to compare the consistency of patientdescribed COPD regimens with GOLD therapeutic recommendations to identify potential pharmacist interventions METHODS Crosssectional, nonrandomized design using a written questionnaire and CAT scores Dispensing data from 35 Missouri community pharmacies initially identified participants aged 40 years or older with 1 or more COPD medications dispensed in the past year Those selfreporting COPD, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis completed a demographic survey with medication history, including oral corticosteroid and antibiotic use, and CAT scores Proportion of days covered PDC was calculated for any COPD maintenance medication dispensed over 1 year The participants COPD was categorized into A, B, C, and D severity groups The reported medication regimens were categorized into consistent with, escalated from, or less than initial firstlinealternative recommended therapy for the A, B, C, and D severity groups RESULTS The participants totaled 709 group A 6 group B 35 group C 4 group D 55 Of the regimens, 41 were consistent with, 34 were escalated from, and 24 were less than initial firstlinealternative GOLD recommendations Most 96 of the participants were highly symptomatic Regimens containing ICS 675 ICS plus LABD 372 exceeded dual LABD 42 The average PDC was 043  037 only 287 were adherent PDC  080 CONCLUSIONS Participants with selfreported COPD were highly symptomatic and nonadherent undertreatment was noted Community pharmacists could provide therapeutic interventions consistent with GOLD A, B, C, and D severity groups, promote dual LABD versus ICS therapies, and optimize adherence,Convalescent plasma CP therapy is one of the promising therapies being tried for COVID19 patients This passive immunity mode involves separating preformed antibodies against SARSCoV2 from a recently recovered COVID19 patient and infusing it into a patient with active disease or an exposed individual for prophylaxis Its advantages include ease of production, rapid deployment, specificity against the target infectious agent, and scalability In the current pandemic, it has been used on a large scale across the globe and also in India However, unequivocal proof of efficacy and effectiveness in COVID19 is still not available Various CP therapy parameters such as donor selection, antibody quantification, timing of use, and dosing need to be considered before its use The current review attempts to summarize the available evidence and provide recommendations for setting up CP protocols in clinical and research settings,Purpose of the ReviewThis is a comprehensive update on failing Fontan physiology and the role of heart and combined heart and liver transplantation in the current eraRecent FindingsSingle ventricle physiology encompasses a series of rare congenital cardiac abnormalities that are characterized by absence of or hypoplasia of one ventricle This effectively results in a single ventricular pumping chamber These abnormalities are rarely compatible with longterm survival if left without surgical palliation in the first few years of life Surgical treatment of single ventricle physiology has evolved over the past 60xa0years and is characterized by numerous creative innovations These include the development of arteriopulmonary shunts, the evolution of partial cavopulmonary connections, and the eventual development of the Fontan operation Regardless of the type of Fontan modification, the longterm consequences of the Fontan operation are predominantly related to chronic central venous hypertension and the multiorgan consequences thereof Atrial arrhythmias can further compromise this circulationPatients with single ventricle physiology represent a special subsegment of congenital cardiac transplants and are arguably the most challenging patients considered for transplantationSummaryThis review describes in detail the challenges and opportunities of heart and liver transplantation in Fontan patients, as viewed and managed by the experienced team at the AhmansonUCLA Adult Congenital Heart Center,A deficiency in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator CFTR function in CF leads to chronic lung disease CF is associated with abnormalities in fatty acids, ceramides, and cholesterol, their relationship with CF lung pathology is not completely understood Therefore, we examined the impact of CFTR deficiency on lipid metabolism and proinflammatory signaling in airway epithelium using mass spectrometric, protein array We observed a striking imbalance in fatty acid and ceramide metabolism, associated with chronic oxidative stress under basal conditions in CF mouse lung and welldifferentiated bronchial epithelial cell cultures of CFTR knock out pig and CF patients Cellautonomous features of all three CF models included high ratios of ω6 to ω3polyunsaturated fatty acids and of long to very longchain ceramide species LCCVLCC, reduced levels of total ceramides and ceramide precursors In addition to the retinoic acid analog fenretinide, the antioxidants glutathione GSH and deferoxamine partially corrected the lipid profile indicating that oxidative stress may promote the lipid abnormalities CFTRtargeted modulators reduced the lipid imbalance and oxidative stress, confirming the CFTR dependence of lipid ratios However, despite functional correction of CF cells up to 60 of nonCF in Ussing chamber experiments, a 72h triple compound treatment elexacaftortezacaftorivacaftor surrogate did not completely normalize lipid imbalance or oxidative stress Protein array analysis revealed differential expression and shedding of cytokines and growth factors from CF epithelial cells compared to nonCF cells, consistent with sterile inflammation and tissue remodeling under basal conditions, including enhanced secretion of the neutrophil activator CXCL5, and the Tcell activator CCL17 However, treatment with antioxidants or CFTR modulators that mimic the approved combination therapies, ivacaftorlumacaftor and ivacaftortezacaftorelexacaftor, did not effectively suppress the inflammatory phenotype We propose that CFTR deficiency causes oxidative stress in CF airway epithelium, affecting multiple bioactive lipid metabolic pathways, which likely play a role in CF lung disease progression A combination of antioxidant, antiinflammatory and CFTR targeted therapeutics may be required for full correction of the CF phenotype,Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is a new disease, and obviously many things about it are not yet known for sure But, the evolution of knowledge about it is being very fast,Multiorgan fibrosis among end stage renal disease ESRD patients cannot be explained by uremia alone Despite mitigation of thrombosis during hemodialysis HD, subsequent platelet dysfunction and tissue dysregulation are less understood We comprehensively profiled plasma and platelets from ESRD patients before and after HD to examine HDmodulation of platelets beyond thrombotic activation Basal plasma levels of proteolytic regulators and fibrotic factors were elevated in ESRD patients compared to healthy controls, with isoformspecific changes during HD Platelet lysate PL RNA transcripts for growth and coagulative factors were elevated postHD, with upregulation correlated to HD vintage Platelet secretome correlations to plasma factors reveal acutely induced profibrotic platelet phenotypes in ESRD patients during HD characterized by preferentially enhanced proteolytic enzyme translation and secretion, platelet contribution to inflammatory response, and increasing platelet dysfunction with blood flow rate BFR and Vintage Compensatory mechanisms of increased platelet growth factor synthesis with acute plasma matrix metalloproteinase MMP and tissue inhibitor of MMPs TIMP increases show shortterm modeswitching between dialysis sessions leading to longterm profibrotic bias Chronic profibrotic adaptation of platelet synthesis were observed through changes in alphagranule and lysosomefilling behaviors We conclude that chronic and acute platelet responses to HD contribute to a profibrotic milieu in ESRD,BACKGROUND There are increasing reports of cardiovascular complications associated with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 due to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 Wellens syndrome, or left anterior descending Twave syndrome, is diagnosed by a pattern of electrocardiographic ECG changes that include inverted or biphasic T waves in leads V2V3 CASE REPORT A 75yearold woman presented to the emergency department with a 1week history of fatigue and progressive shortness of breath who acutely decompensated, necessitating mechanical ventilator support Initial lab workup revealed COVID19 positivity, which was confirmed by repeat testing A routine ECG obtained during her hospitalization and compared with her baseline revealed diffuse Twave inversions of her precordial leads, which was highly suggestive of Wellens syndrome Cardiac enzymes obtained were slightly elevated and an echocardiogram did not demonstrate wall motion abnormalities The patient was initiated on nonST segment elevation myocardial infarction protocol with heparin infusion for 48 hours and dual antiplatelet therapy, in addition to beta blockade Repeat ECGs showed complete resolution of Wellens syndrome shortly after therapy CONCLUSIONS Although rare, Wellens syndrome is a significant indicator of left anterior descending artery stenosis and is commonly associated with acute medical illness COVID19 pneumonia has been associated with many adverse cardiovascular outcomes, with ischemia and arrhythmia becoming increasingly more common Diagnosis of Wellens often includes coronary angiography however, during the current pandemic, many authorities have recommended medical management alone during the acute phase of care, depending on the severity of concomitant illness,INTRODUCTION Coronavirus disease19 COVID19 is a new type of epidemic pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 The population is generally susceptible to COVID19, which mainly causes lung injury Some cases may develop severe acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS Currently, ARDS treatment is mainly mechanical ventilation, but mechanical ventilation often causes ventilatorinduced lung injury VILI accompanied by hypercapnia in 14 of patients Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal ECCO2R can remove carbon dioxide from the blood of patients with ARDS, correct the respiratory acidosis, reduce the tidal volume and airway pressure, and reduce the incidence of VILI CASE REPORT Two patients with critical COVID19 combined with multiple organ failure undertook mechanical ventilation and suffered from hypercapnia ECCO2R, combined with continuous renal replacement therapy CRRT, was conducted concomitantly In both cases No 1 and 2, the tidal volume and positive endexpiratory pressure PEEP were downregulated before the treatment and at 15 hours, one day, three days, five days, eight days, and ten days after the treatment, together with a noticeable decrease in PCO2 and clear increase in PO2, while FiO2 decreased to approximately 40 In case No 2, compared with the condition before treatment, the PCO2 decreased significantly with downregulation in the tidal volume and PEEP and improvement in the pulmonary edema and ARDS after the treatment CONCLUSION ECCO2R combined with continuous blood purification therapy in patients with COVID19 who are critically ill and have ARDS and hypercapnia might gain both time and opportunity in the treatment, downregulate the ventilator parameters, reduce the incidence of VILI and achieve favorable therapeutic outcomes,,Cardiovascular disease manifestations CVD are the worlds leading cause of death, and their impact on morbidity requires effective prevention strategies of recurrent adverse events For decades, inflammation has been proposed as a key promoter for atherosclerosis and its complications However, studies on the use of drugs to target the excess inflammation in CVD are limited In 2017, the Canakinumab Antiinflammatory Thrombosis Outcome Study CANTOS trial confirmed the key role of inflammation on atherosclerotic disease Canakinumab is a monoclonal antibody that blocks an inflammatory pathway mediated by IL1β The results of the CANTOS trial opened a new era of investigating new therapeutics targeting inflammation for CVD secondary prevention This review presents the canakinumabs pharmacology, current clinical development status and regulatory perspectives,Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 in 2019, it is gaining worldwide attention at the moment Apart from respiratory manifestations, neurological dysfunction in COVID19 patients, especially the occurrence of cerebrovascular diseases CVD, has been intensively investigated In this review, the effects of COVID19 infection on CVD were summarized as follows I angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ACE2 may be involved in the attack on vascular endothelial cells by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 SARSCoV2, leading to endothelial damage and increased subintimal inflammation, which are followed by hemorrhage or thrombosis II SARSCoV2 could alter the expressionactivity of ACE2, consequently resulting in the disruption of reninangiotensin system which is associated with the occurrence and progression of atherosclerosis III upregulation of neutrophil extracellular traps has been detected in COVID19 patients, which is closely associated with immunothrombosis IV the inflammatory cascade induced by SARSCoV2 often leads to hypercoagulability and promotes the formation and progress of atherosclerosis V antiphospholipid antibodies are also detected in plasma of some severe cases, which aggravate the thrombosis through the formation of immune complexes VI hyperglycemia in COVID19 patients may trigger CVD by increasing oxidative stress and blood viscosity VII the COVID19 outbreak is a global emergency and causes psychological stress, which could be a potential risk factor of CVD as coagulation, and fibrinolysis may be affected In this review, we aimed to further our understanding of CVDassociated COVID19 infection, which could improve the therapeutic outcomes of patients Personalized treatments should be offered to COVID19 patients at greater risk for stroke in future clinical practice,ObjectiveTo observe the changes of symptoms, Chinese medicine CM syndrome, and lung inflammation absorption during convalescence in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 who had not totally recovered after hospital discharge and whether CM could promote the improvement processMethodsThis study was designed as a prospective cohort and nested casecontrol study A total of 96 eligible patients with COVID19 in convalescence were enrolled from Beijing Youan Hospital and Beijing Huimin Hospital and followed up from the hospital discharged day Patients were divided into the CM 64 cases and the control groups 32 cases based on the treatment with or without CM and followed up at 14, 28, 56, and 84 days after discharge In the CM group, patients received the 28day CM treatment according to two types of CM syndrome Improvements in clinical symptoms, CM syndrome, and absorption of lung inflammation were observedResultsAll the 96 patients completed the 84day followup from January 21 to March 28, 2020 By the 84th day of followup, respiratory symptoms were less than 5 There was no significant difference in the improvement rates of symptoms, including fatigue, sputum, cough, dry throat, thirst, and upset, between the two groups P005 Totally 82 patients 8542 showed complete lung inflammation absorption at the 84day followup On day 14, the CM group had a significantly higher absorption rate than the control group P005 and the relative risk of absorption for CM vs control group was 3029 95 confidence interval 10268940 The proportions of CM syndrome types changed with time prolonging the proportion of the pathogen residue syndrome gradually decreased, and the proportion of both qi and yin deficiency syndrome gradually increasedConclusionsPatients with COVID19 in convalescence had symptoms and lung inflammation after hospital discharge and recovered with time prolonging CM could improve lung inflammation for early recovery The types of CM syndrome can be transformed with time prolonging Registration No ChiCTR2000029430,Background There is a persistent concern over the risk of respiratory pathogen transmission, including SARSCoV2, by formation of aerosols a suspension of microdroplets and residual microparticles after evaporation generated by high flow nasal cannula HFNC oxygen therapy in criticallyill patients This concern is fueled by limited available studies on this subject In the present study, we test our hypothesis that HFNC treatment is not associated with increased aerosol formation as compared to conventional oxygenMethods We used laser light scattering and a handheld particle counter to detect and quantitate aerosols in both healthy subjects, as well as adults with acute respiratory disease, including COVID19, receiving HFNC versus conventional oxygen therapyResults The use of HFNC was not associated with increased formation of aerosols as compared to conventional oxygen therapy in both healthy subjects n3 and subjects with acute respiratory disease, including COVID19 n17Conclusion In line with scarce previous clinical and experimental findings, this study indicates that HFNC itself does not result in overall increased aerosol formation as compared to conventional oxygen therapy This suggests there is no increased risk of respiratory pathogen transmission by HFNC to health care workers,,,RATIONALE Patients with severe COVID19 require supplemental oxygen and ventilatory support It is unclear whether some respiratory support devices may increase the dispersion of infectious bioaerosols and thereby place healthcare workers at increased risk of infection with SARSCoV2 OBJECTIVES To quantitatively compare viral dispersion from invasive and noninvasive respiratory support modalities METHODS A simulated intensive care unit room with a breathing patient simulator exhaling nebulized bacteriophage from the lower respiratory tract with various respiratory support modalities invasive ventilation through an endotracheal tube with inflated cuff connected to a mechanical ventilator helmet ventilation with PEEP valve noninvasive bilevel positive pressure ventilation nonrebreather face mask highflow nasal oxygen and nasal prongs MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Invasive ventilation and helmet ventilation with a PEEP valve were associated with the lowest bacteriophage concentrations in the air, and highflow nasal oxygen and nasal prongs the highest At the intubating position, bacteriophage concentrations associated with highflow nasal oxygen 266 × 104 PFUL of air sampled, nasal prongs 160 × 104 PFUL of air sampled, nonrebreather facemask 787 × 102 PFUL of air sampled, and BiPAP 191 × 102 PFUL of air sampled were significantly higher when compared to invasive ventilation each P  005 The difference between bacteriophage concentrations associated with helmet ventilation with a PEEP valve 429 × 101 PFUL of air sampled and invasive ventilation was not statistically significant This article is open access and distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial No

lung injury EVALI Various theoretical mechanisms have been proposed for toxicity, including tocopherol vitamin Emediated surfactant damage, recruitment of inflammation, and pyrolysis of acetate to the pulmonary irritant keteneObjectiveCharacterize studies in mammals evaluating inhaled VEA, vitamin E analogues, or pyrolyzed acetate that describe subsequent effects on the lungEligibilityResearch in all languages from time of inception to October 1, 2020, regarding mammals human or animal exposed to inhaled vitamin E analogues, or any compound containing acetate administered via inhalation after pyrolysis, and subsequent description of pulmonary effectSources of evidenceOvid MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science Core CollectionResultsIn total, 786 unique articles were identified After duplicate reviewer screening, 16 articles were eligible for inclusion Tocopherol was evaluated in 688 1116 of the studies, VEA in 188 316, and both VEA and tocopherol were evaluated in 125 216 Of the five studies evaluating VEA, it was given by pyrolysis in 600 35 No human studies were identified All included trials were conducted on nonhuman mammals 750 1216 rodent models and 250 416 sheep models Outcomes assessed were heterogeneous and included 57 unique outcomesConclusionsSeveral questions still exist regarding the pulmonary toxicity of inhaled tocopherol and VEA More studies are needed to determine whether tocopherol alone ie, without acetate can cause pulmonary injury Additionally, further studies of VEA should evaluate the impact that pyrolysis and coadministration with other compounds, such as tetrahydrocannabinol, have on the toxic potential of VEA,Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ACE2 acts as the receptor for the type 2 coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome SARSCoV2, the etiological agent of coronavirus19 disease COVID19 There has been a growing concern that reninangiotensin RAS blockade increases the expression of ACE2 and then elevate patient susceptibility to SARSCoV2 Here, we report that age, smoking and RAS blockade influence on the percentage of human ACE2expressing type II pneumocytes These findings may explain the increased susceptibility to COVID19 with age and in subjects with treated cardiovascularrelated pathologies Enhanced ACE2expressing type II pneumonocytes would facilitate SARSCoV2 infection, thus increasing patient susceptibility to acute respiratory distress syndrome development because of an unbalance between the pressor and depressor axis of the RAS due to ACE2 sequestration by the virus,,Background Role of microaspiration of mucus mixed with SARSCoV2 severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 causing pneumonia is lacking in searched literature Recently some authors have emphasized on microaspiration SARSCoV2 primarily replicates in nasal mucosa and sheds in nasal mucus which travels down as microaspiration and causes pneumonia We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of normal saline nasal spray and gargle NSNSG to wash off SARSCoV2 from nasal and pharyngeal mucosa to prevent microaspiration and pneumoniaxa0xa0Methods From RTPCR reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction report, we selected 61 patients for study group and 64 patients for control, having higher virion loadxa0cycle threshold Ct value 25 or less Patients in study group were trained with NSNSG We reviewed HRCT high resolution computed tomogram of lung in 56 patients of both groups for severity score in lung and were compared with initial HRCTxa0Results Twenty nine out of 61 47 of study group significantly p0·02 became negative following NSNSG compared to 17 out of 64 patients 26 of control Severity score SS in 31 out of 34 patients 91 either decreased or became static in study group In control group, 14 out of 22 patients 63 also showed same findingsxa0Nevertheless, study group significantly improved p0·028 in SSxa0Conclusions NSNSG significantly washes off SARSCoV2 from nasal

disease19 COVID19 will proceed to lifethreatening pulmonary disease stages Here I discuss endothelialepithelial cooperative in vivo responses producing firstline, humoral innate defence opportunities in human airways The pseudostratified epithelium of human nasal and tracheobronchial airways are prime sites of exposure and infection by SARSCoV2 Just beneath the epithelium runs a profuse systemic microcirculation Its postcapillary venules respond conspicuously to mucosal challenges with autacoids, allergens and microbes, and to mere loss of epithelium By active venular endothelial gap formation, followed by transient yielding of epithelial junctions, nonsieved plasma macromolecules move from the microcirculation to the mucosal surface Hence, plasmaderived protein cascade systems and antimicrobial peptides would have opportunity to operate jointly on an unperturbed mucosal lining Similarly, a plasmaderived, dynamic gel protects sites of epithelial sloughingregeneration Precision for this indiscriminate humoral molecular response lies in restricted location and wellregulated duration of plasma exudation Importantly, the endothelial responsiveness of the airway microcirculation differs distinctly from the relatively nonresponsive, lowpressure pulmonary microcirculation that nonspecifically, almost irreversibly, leaks plasma in lifethreatening COVID19 Observations in humans of infections with rhinovirus, coronavirus 229E, and influenza A and B support a general but individually variable early occurrence of plasma exudation in human infected nasal and tracheobronchial airways Investigations are warranted to elucidate roles of host and druginduced airway plasma exudation in restriction of viral infection and, specifically, whether it contributes to variable disease responses following exposure to SARSCoV2,A 31year old male with no comorbidities presented with chest discomfort and shortness of breath following SARSCoV2 infection Primary viral myocarditis was confirmed with the aid of cardiac biomarkers and cardiac magnetic resonance CMR imaging Herein, we detail his clinical presentation, management and highlight the role of CMR in viral myocarditis,,,,,,,,,BACKGROUND Current techniques for measuring absolute lung volumes rely on bulky and expensive equipment, and are complicated to use for the operator and the patient A novel method for measurement of absolute lung volumes, the minibox method, is presented RESEARCH QUESTION Across a population of patients and healthy subjects, do values for total lung capacity TLC determined by the novel compact device MiniBoxTM compare favorably with measurements determined by traditional whole body plethysmography METHODS A total of 266 subjects 130 male and respiratory patients were recruited from five global centers three in Europe and two in the US The study population comprised individuals with obstructive N197 and restrictive disorders N33 as well as healthy subjects N36 TLC measured by conventional plethysmography TLCPleth were compared to TLC measured using the novel MiniBoxTM TLCMB device RESULTS TLC values ranged between 27109 Liters The normalized rootmeansquare difference NSD between TLCPleth and TLCMB was 70 in healthy subjects In obstructed patients the NSD was 79 in mild obstruction and 91 in severe obstruction In restricted patients the NSD was 78 in mild restriction and 139 in moderate and severe restriction There were no significant differences between TLC values obtained by the two measurement techniques There were also no significant differences in results obtained between the five centers INTERPRETATION TLC as measured by the novel MiniBoxTM system is not significantly different from TLC measured by conventional whole body plethysmography, thus validating the minibox method as a reliable method to measure absolute lung volumes,The application of artificial intelligence AI to the electrocardiogram ECG, a ubiquitous and standardized test, is an example of the ongoing transformative effect of AI on cardiovascular medicine Although the ECG has long offered valuable insights into cardiac and noncardiac health and disease, its interpretation requires considerable human expertise Advanced AI methods, such as deeplearning convolutional neural networks, have enabled rapid, humanlike interpretation of the ECG, while signals and patterns largely unrecognizable to human interpreters can be detected by multilayer AI networks with precision, making the ECG a powerful, noninvasive biomarker Large sets of digital ECGs linked to rich clinical data have been used to develop AI models for the detection of left ventricular dysfunction, silent previously undocumented and asymptomatic atrial fibrillation and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, as well as the determination of a persons age, sex and race, among other phenotypes The clinical and populationlevel implications of AIbased ECG phenotyping continue to emerge, particularly with the rapid rise in the availability of mobile and wearable ECG technologies In this Review, we summarize the current and future state of the AIenhanced ECG in the detection of cardiovascular disease in atrisk populations, discuss its implications for clinical decisionmaking in patients with cardiovascular disease and critically appraise potential limitations and unknowns,Abstract  COVID19 pandemic resulted in considerable morbidity and mortality We analyzed 345 Electrocardiograms of 100 COVID19 patients admitted to our tertiary care center in Detroit, during the initial month of Covid19 Findings were correlated with mortality, cardiac injury and inflammatory markers Our cohort included 61 males and 77 African Americans The median age and BMI were 66 years 5774 and 31 kgm 2 26139, respectively We observed atrial arrhythmias in 29 of the patients 17 new onset, First degree heart block in 12, STT segment changes in 17, S1Q3T3 pattern in 19, premature ventricular complexes in 23, premature atrial complexes in 13, Q waves in 27, T wave inversion in 42 of the cases While presence of premature atrial complexes or left atrial abnormality correlated with mortality P  002  003, respectively, other findings did not show significant correlation in this small cohort of patients,Clinical manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 is diverse ranging from asymptomatic or mild respiratory symptoms to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS and respiratory failure As the pandemic progresses, the number of critically ill COVID19 patients continues to increase Whether or not COVID19 ARDS patients are distinct from conventional ARDS is not settled, and there is no definite evidence that they should be treated differently from ARDS of other origins The use of oxygen treatment with high flow nasal cannula has been increased Invasive mechanical ventilation should be applied with lung protective strategy in mind Prone positioning should be actively considered Since the primary cause of death of COVID19 patients is respiratory failure, understanding the characteristics of COVID19 ARDS and its treatment is necessary for optimal outcome,BACKGROUND Several studies have highlighted the disparities in gender equity that exist in different medical specialties The COVID19 pandemic has further heightened the inequity faced by female physicians as they are challenged by increasing household and childcare duties in addition to their professional responsibilities Given these hurdles, fewer women than men have published in various medical disciplines In this brief report, we wanted to determine the impact of the COVID19 pandemic on the academic output of female physicians and researchers in transfusion medicine STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS We compared all articles in four transfusion medicine journals published from January 1 to July 31, 2019 with the same time period in 2020 Overall, 1024 articles were reviewed for whether they included women as first or senior authors RESULTS Overall, women were first authors in 459 n  458 of all publications and senior authors in 35 n  356 of all publications There was a statistically significant decrease in the percentage of women as first authors between 2019 491 and 2020 427 p  04 There was no significant change in the percentage of women as senior authors between 2019 354 and 2020 355 p  099 CONCLUSIONS Similar to other medical specialties, the COVID19 pandemic has further increased the disparities faced by female researchers in transfusion medicine as evidenced by a decrease in publications with women as first authors,The novel coronavirus SARSCoV2 has produced millions of infections and deaths worldwide It is believed that adaptive immunity to the virus occurs although with variation in its pattern and duration While uncommon, confirmed reinfection with the novel coronavirus has been reported Telemedicine has emerged as a viable tool for the delivery of healthcare in lieu of inperson patient contact The variable and occasionally rapid course of clinical disease raises safety concerns of using telemedicine in the clinical management of acute infection with the novel coronavirus We present a case of novel coronavirus infection in an immunocompetent individual with obstructive sleep apnea OSA who failed to manifest an adaptive immune response to acute infection and was subsequently reinfected The case highlights the use of telemedicine in managing novel coronavirus respiratory disease and the potential role of OSA as a disease facilitator,OBJECTIVES The current report describes a single operators experience of the first use of smartglass technology as a facilitator of virtual support during TAVR proctoring BACKGROUND Restricted gatherings and containment measures during the ongoing COVID19 pandemic have a major impact on daily clinical practice Interaction between peers is crucial in science, clinical practice, and education In addition, there is also a growing importance of proctoring in interventional cardiology for structural heart disease Virtual support may facilitate the wide implementation of remote proctoring METHODS A collaboration between a smartglass provider Rods  Cones and selfexpandable transcatheter aortic heart valve system Medtronic was initiated and tested extensively prior to TAVR procedures Two cases were randomly selected for remote support The lightweight smartglass consisted of a full HD central camera, a 720p ×5 optical zoom camera, builtin LED light, speaker and earphone jack, and an external visor to project data in a nonobstructive manner in the operators view RESULTS Preprocedural detailed discussion of the cases between the proctor and the operator occurred via teleconferencing Successful procedural virtual support was determined by the presence of a session coordinator, high quality of the central camera, highspeed and stable wireless internet connection Limitations were the relative discomfort of the earpieces, discordance between the central and zoom camera and the absence of visual fixation during head motions CONCLUSION In a highly complex and demanding context such as TAVR, remote proctoring by means of virtual support is feasible and efficacious,,OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study is the development of a porcine model of carbon monoxide CO poisoning to investigate alterations in brain and heart mitochondrial function DESIGN Two group large animal model of CO poisoning SETTING Laboratory SUBJECTS Ten swine were divided into two groups Control nu2009u20094 and CO nu2009u20096 INTERVENTIONS Administration of a low dose of CO at 200u2009ppm to the CO group over 90u2009min followed by 30u2009min of reoxygenation at room air The Control group received room air for 120u2009min MEASUREMENTS Noninvasive optical monitoring was used to measure cerebral blood flow and oxygenation Cerebral microdialysis was performed to obtain semi real time measurements of cerebral metabolic status At the end of the exposure, both fresh brain cortical and hippocampal tissue and heart apical tissue were immediately harvested to measure mitochondrial respiration and reactive oxygen species ROS generation and blood was collected to assess plasma cytokine concentrations MAIN RESULTS Animals in the CO group showed significantly decreased Complex IVlinked mitochondrial respiration in hippocampal and apical heart tissue but not cortical tissue There also was a significant increase in mitochondrial ROS generation across all measured tissue types The CO group showed a significantly higher cerebral lactatetopyruvate ratio Both IL8 and TNFα were significantly increased in the CO group compared with the Control group obtained from plasma While not significant there was a trend to an increase in optically measured cerebral blood flow and hemoglobin concentration in the CO group CONCLUSIONS Lowdose CO poisoning is associated with early mitochondrial disruption prior to an observable phenotype highlighting the important role of mitochondrial function in the pathology of CO poisoning This may represent an important intervenable pathway for therapy and intervention,Heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome Jamshid Easa, Jacob Chappell and David Warriner explain the pathogenesis behind the most common form of this condition Heart failure a complex clinical syndrome due to impairment of ventricular filling or contraction, resulting in a constellation of physical symptoms and signs, primarily due to salt and water retention In this clinically focused review of the pathophysiology, we will summarise the main consequences of the most common type, left ventricular failure knowledge of which is essential for those working in general practice due to the high prevalence of heart failure in the community and to aid understanding of the various pharmacotherapies that work to act on the pathological mechanisms,Individuals with established cardiovascular disease or a high burden of cardiovascular risk factors may be particularly vulnerable to develop complications from coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 We conducted a prospective cohort study at a tertiary care center to identify risk factors for inhospital mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events MACE a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, new acute decompensated heart failure, venous thromboembolism, ventricular or atrial arrhythmia, pericardial effusion, or aborted cardiac arrest among consecutively hospitalized adults with COVID19, using multivariable binary logistic regression analysis The study population comprised 586 COVID19 positive patients Median age was 67 IQR 55 to 80 years, 474 were female, and 367 had cardiovascular disease Considering risk factors, 602 had hypertension, 398 diabetes, and 386 hyperlipidemia Eightytwo individuals 140 died inhospital, and 135 230 experienced MACE In a model adjusted for demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, and laboratory findings, age odds ratio OR, 128 per 5 years 95 confidence interval CI, 113 to 145, previous ventricular arrhythmia OR, 1897 95 CI, 368 to 9788, use of P2Y12inhibitors OR, 791 95 CI, 164 to 3817, higher Creactive protein OR, 181 95 CI, 118 to 278, lower albumin OR, 064 95 CI, 047 to 086, and higher troponin T OR, 184 95 CI, 139 to 246 were associated with mortality p 005 After adjustment for demographics, presentation, and laboratory findings, predictors of MACE were higher respiratory rates, altered mental status, and laboratory abnormalities, including higher troponin T p 005 In conclusion, poor prognostic markers among hospitalized patients with COVID19 included older age, preexisting cardiovascular disease, respiratory failure, altered mental status, and higher troponin T concentrations,With the everexpanding population of patients infected with SARSCoV2, we are learning more about the immediate and longterm clinical manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 Ischemic stroke IS is now one of the welldocumented additional clinical manifestations of COVID19 Most COVID19 related IS cases have been categorized as cryptogenic or embolic stroke of undetermined source ESUS, which are most often suspected to have an undiagnosed cardioembolic source COVID19 is known to also cause cardiac dysfunction, heart failure, and atrial arrhythmias AA, but the longterm impact of this cardiac dysfunction on stroke incidence is unknown With millions afflicted with COVID19 and the everrising infection rate, it is important to consider the potential longterm impact of COVID19 on future IS incidence Accomplishing these goals will require novel strategies that allow for diagnosis, data capture, and prediction of future IS risk using tools that are adaptable to the evolving clinical challenges in patient care delivery and research,A high incidence of thromboembolic events and coagulation parameter abnormalities are seen in cases of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 Both venous and arterial thrombosis, including arterial thrombosis in unusual sites, have been reported in COVID patients in recent literature Herein, we report a case of a 67yearold female patient with noncritical COVID19 disease with an incidental finding of an asymptomatic splenic infarct In the absence of a cardioembolic source, we believe this was an arterial thromboembolic event in the splenic circulation The duration and modality of anticoagulation of inpatient and ambulatory COVID patients remains a dynamic discussion Our case adds the evidence of a clinically silent arterial thrombotic event in a noncritical COVID19 patient which further emphasizes the need to address the strategies for diagnosis and management of thromboembolism to prevent potentially fatal complications,Introduction Subjects recovering from COVID19 frequently experience persistent respiratory ailments however, little is known about the underlying biological factors that may direct lung recovery and the extent to which these are affected by COVID19 severity Methods We performed a prospective cohort study of subjects with persistent symptoms after recovering from acute COVID19 illness, collecting clinical data, pulmonary function tests, and blood Plasma samples were used for multiplex profiling of circulating factors associated with inflammation, metabolism, angiogenesis, and fibrosis Results Sixtyone subjects were enrolled across two academic medical centers at a median of 9 weeks interquartile range 610 after COVID19 illness n13 subjects 21 mildnonhospitalized, n30 49 hospitalizednoncritical, and n18 subjects 30 hospitalizedintensive care ICU Fiftythree subjects 85 had lingering symptoms, most commonly dyspnea 69 and cough 58 Forced vital capacity FVC, forced expiratory volume in 1 second FEV1, and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide DLCO declined as COVID19 severity increased P005, but did not correlate with respiratory symptoms Partial leastsquares discriminant analysis of plasma biomarker profiles clustered subjects by past COVID19 severity Lipocalin 2 LCN2, matrix metalloproteinase7 MMP7, and hepatocyte growth factor HGF identified by the model were significantly higher in the ICU group P005 and inversely correlated with FVC and DLCO P005 Conclusions Subjective respiratory symptoms are common after acute COVID19 illness but do not correlate with COVID19 severity or pulmonary function Host response profiles reflecting neutrophil activation LCN2, fibrosis signaling MMP7, and alveolar repair HGF track with lung impairment and may be novel therapeutic or prognostic targets Funding The study was funded in part by the NHLBI K08HL130557 to BDK and R01HL142818 to HJC, the DeLuca Foundation Award AP, a donation from Jack Levin to the Benign Hematology Program at Yale, and DivisionalDepartmental funds from Duke University,COVID19 pandemic has imposed worldwide challenge and has significantly affected transfusion medicine Shortage in blood products along with concerns regarding the safety of blood products have emerged Measures to overcome these challenges have been implemented in order to decrease the demand on blood products and to encourage blood donations while taking full precautions to minimize risk of COVID19 transmission mainly at blood banks and medical centers Several countries have been successful in facing these new challenges In addition, the role of plasma therapy in the treatment of COVID19 patients, especially in severe cases, has been proposed and current studies are being conducted to determine its efficacy Other therapeutic options are currently being explored So far, the use of convalescent plasma is considered a promising rescue treatment to be looked at,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic has dramatically changed medical practices worldwide These changes have been aimed both to reallocate resources toward fighting the novel coronavirus and to prevent its transmission during nonurgent medical and surgical interventions Heart and lung transplantation could not be an exception, as most transplant centers have either restricted their activity to only urgent, lifesaving procedures or stopped these surgical procedures for various periods of time depending on the local virus epidemiology The effect of this infection on the immunosuppressed heart and lung transplant recipient is still questionable however, there are limited reports suggesting that there is no increased risk of transmission or more severe disease course compared with that shown in the general population Transplant organizations have disseminated early recommendations as a guidance in a yet evolving situation Finally, data suggest that lung transplant could potentially serve as an ultimate, lifesaving procedure for COVID19related endstage respiratory failure in carefully selected patients,We described a case report of a 50xa0yearsoldwoman admitted to the emergency department with abdominal pain associated with febrile hepatosplenomegaly with the final diagnosis of suprahepatic vein thrombosis secondary to COVID19 Initially, this patient stayed out of a private room because of this atypical presentation and caused a COVID19 outbreak in the emergency department,A 63yearold woman was admitted with severe respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation and shock requiring vasopressor support She was found to have COVID19 pneumonia Focused cardiac ultrasound performed for evaluation of shock was significant for right ventricular dilation and dysfunction with signs of right ventricular pressure overload Given worsening shock and hypoxemia systemic thrombolysis was administered for presumed massive pulmonary embolism with remarkable improvement of hemodynamics and respiratory failure In next 24xa0h patients neurologic status deteriorated to the point of unresponsiveness Emergent computed tomography showed multiple ischemic infarcts concerning for embolic etiology Focused cardiac ultrasound with agitated saline showed large right to left shunt due to a patent foramen ovale This was confirmed by transesophageal echocardiogram, 5 months later This case highlights strengths of focused cardiac ultrasound in critical care setting and in patients with COVID19 when access to other imaging modalities can be limited,,BACKGROUND The newly emerged coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 seems to involve different organs, including the cardiovascular system We systematically reviewed COVID19 cardiac complications and calculated their pooled incidences Secondarily, we compared the cardiac troponin I cTnI level between the surviving and expired patients METHODS A systematic search was conducted for manuscripts published from December 1, 2019 to April 16, 2020 Cardiovascular complications, along with the levels of cTnI, creatine kinase CK, and creatine kinase MB CKMB in hospitalized PCRconfirmed COVID19 patients were extracted The pooled incidences of the extracted data were calculated, and the unadjusted cTnI level was compared between the surviving and expired patients RESULTS Out of 1094 obtained records, 22 studies on a total of 4,157 patients were included The pooled incidence rate of arrhythmia was 1011 Furthermore, myocardial injury had a pooled incidence of 1785, and finally, the pooled incidence for heart failure was 2234 The pooled incidence rates of cTnI, CKMB, and CK elevations were also reported at 1516, 1092, and 1299, respectively Moreover, the pooled level of unadjusted cTnI was significantly higher in expired cases compared with the surviving mean difference  31818, 95 CI  1792345713, P value 0001 CONCLUSION COVID19 can affect different parts of the heart however, the myocardium is more involved,BACKGROUND The COVID19 pandemic is a significant public health crisis that is hitting hard on peoples health, wellbeing, and freedom of movement, and affecting the global economy Scientists worldwide are competing to develop therapeutics and vaccines currently, three drugs and two vaccine candidates have been given emergency authorization use However, there are still questions of efficacy with regard to specific subgroups of patients and the vaccines scalability to the general public Under such circumstances, understanding COVID19 symptoms is vital in initial triage it is crucial to distinguish the severity of cases for effective management and treatment This study aimed to discover symptom patterns and overall symptom rules, including rules disaggregated by age, sex, chronic condition, and mortality status, among COVID19 patients METHODS This study was a retrospective analysis of COVID19 patient data made available online by the Wolfram Data Repository through May 27, 2020 We applied a widely used rulebased machine learning technique called association rule mining to identify frequent symptoms and define patterns in the rules discovered RESULT In total, 1,560 patients with COVID19 were included in the study, with a median age of 52 years The most frequently occurring symptom was fever 67, followed by cough 37, malaisebody soreness 11, pneumonia 11, and sore throat 8 Myocardial infarction, heart failure, and renal disease were present in less than 1 of patients The top ten significant symptom rules out of 71 generated showed cough, septic shock, and respiratory distress syndrome as frequent consequents If a patient had a breathing problem and sputum production, then, there was higher confidence of that patient having a cough if cardiac disease, renal disease, or pneumonia was present, then there was a higher confidence of septic shock or respiratory distress syndrome Symptom rules differed between younger and older patients and between male and female patients Patients who had chronic conditions or died of COVID19 had more severe symptom rules than those patients who did not have chronic conditions or survived of COVID19 Concerning chronic condition rules among 147 patients, if a patient had diabetes, prerenal azotemia, and coronary bypass surgery, there was a certainty of hypertension CONCLUSION The most frequently reported symptoms in patients with COVID19 were fever, cough, pneumonia, and sore throat while 1 had severe symptoms, such as septic shock, respiratory distress syndrome, and respiratory failure Symptom rules differed by age and sex Patients with chronic disease and patients who died of COVID19 had severe symptom rules more specifically, cardiovascularrelated symptoms accompanied by pneumonia, fever, and cough as consequents,The incidence of large disasters has been increasing worldwide This has led to a growing interest in disaster medicine In this review, we report current evidence related to disasters and coronavirus disease2019 COVID19 pandemic, such as cardiovascular diseases during disasters, management of disaster hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases associated with COVID19 This review summarizes the time course and mechanisms of disasterrelated diseases It also discusses the use of information and communication technology ICT as a cardiovascular risk management strategy to prevent cardiovascular events During the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, we used the Disaster Cardiovascular Prevention system that was employed for blood pressure BP monitoring and risk management using ICT We introduced an ICTbased BP monitoring device at evacuation centers and shared patients BP values in the database to support BP management by remote monitoring, which led to improved BP control Effective use of telemedicine using ICT is important for risk management of cardiovascular diseases during disasters and pandemics in the future,Abstract  Background  Postmyocardial infarction ventricular septal defects VSDs have become rare in the reperfusion era but remain associated with very high morbidity and mortality As patients defer prompt evaluation and management of acute coronary syndromes during the COVID19 global pandemic, the incidence of these and other postinfarction mechanical complications is expected to increase   Case summary  A 37yearold gentleman with multiple coronary artery disease risk factors presented with intermittent chest discomfort and 1 week of heart failure symptoms An echocardiogram demonstrated a large muscular VSD and coronary angiography confirmed the presence of an anterior wall infarction He was subsequently referred for transcatheter VSD repair and showed rapid clinical improvement in his symptoms   Discussion  Postinfarction VSDs remain associated with a high degree of morbidity and mortality Surgical repair of acutely ruptured myocardium can be technically challenging, and transcatheter repair has emerged as a safe and effective alternative,,,,Purpose of ReviewProvide an updated review of the clinical management and diagnosis of Kawasaki disease with inclusion of potential diagnostic difficulties with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children MISC given the ongoing COVID19 pandemicRecent FindingsAdjunctive corticosteroid therapy has been shown to reduce the rate of coronary artery dilation in children at high risk for IVIG resistance in multiple Japanese clinical studies most notably RAISE study group Additional adjunctive therapies etanercept, infliximab, cyclosporin may also provide limited benefit, but data is limited to single studies and subgroups of patients with cardiac abnormalities The efficacy of other agents atorvastatin, doxycycline is currently being investigated MISC is a clinically distinct entity from KD with broad clinical manifestations and multiorgan involvement cardiac, GI, hematologic, dermatologic, respiratory, renal MISC with Kawasaki manifestations is more commonly seen in children  5 years of ageSummaryThe 2017 American Heart Association AHA treatment guidelines have included changes in aspirin dosing including both 80100 mgkgday and 3050 mgkgday treatment options, consideration of the use of adjuvant corticosteroid therapy in patients at high risk of IVIG resistance, and the change in steroid regimen for refractory KD to include both pulsedose IVMP and longer course of prednisolone with an oral taper A significant proportion of children diagnosed with MISC, a postinfectious syndrome of SARSCoV2 infection, meet criteria for Kawasaki disease Further investigation is warranted to further delineate these conditions and optimize treatment of these conditions given the ongoing COVID19 pandemic,BackgroundS100 calcium binding protein A9 S100A9 is a proinflammatory alarmin associated with several inflammationrelated diseases However, the role of S100A9 in lung injury in sepsis has not been fully investigated Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the role of S100A9 in a lipopolysaccharide LPSinduced lung injury murine model and its underlying molecular mechanismsMethodsLPS was utilized to induce sepsis and lung injury in C57BL6 or NODlike receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 NLRP3 mice To investigate the effects of S100A9 blockade, mice were treated with a specific inhibitor of S100A9 Subsequently, lung injury and inflammation were evaluated by histology and enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay ELISA, respectively Furthermore, western blot analysis and RTqPCR were carried out to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of S100A9ResultsS100A9 was upregulated in the lung tissues of LPStreated mice However, inhibition of S100A9 alleviated LPSinduced lung injury Additionally, S100A9 blockade also attenuated the inflammatory responses and apoptosis in the lungs of LPSchallenged mice Furthermore, the increased expression of NLRP3 was also suppressed by S100A9 blockade, while S100A9 blockade had no effect on NLRP3 mice In vitro, S100A9 downregulation mitigated LPSinduced inflammation Interestingly, these effects were blunted by NLRP3 overexpressionConclusionThe results of the current study suggested that inhibition of S100A9 could protect against LPSinduced lung injury via inhibiting the NLRP3 pathway Therefore, S100A9 blockade could be considered as a novel therapeutic strategy for lung injury in sepsis,Cardiovascular disease CVD and its sequelae have long been the leading causes of death and disability in the developed world Although mortality associated with CVD has been decreasing, due in large part to novel therapeutic options, the rate of decrease has flattened Thus, there is a great need to investigate alternate therapeutic strategies that can increase efficacy while decreasing adverse effects Nanomaterials have been widely investigated and have emerged as promising tools for both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes in oncology however, the potential of nanomaterials has not been extensively explored for cardiovascular medicine In this review, we focus on recent developments in the field of nanomedicines targeted for CVDs, with a special emphasis on cell membranecoated nanoparticles NPs and their applications,It has been observed that patients with COVID19 infection may develop acute pulmonary embolism APE, acute myocardial infarction, limb thrombosis, and venous and  or arterial thrombosis, including central nervous system Thrombosis formation in COVID19 patients can be explained by the virchow triad Severe Acute Respiratory SyndromeCoronavirus2 SARSCoV2 can directly attack vascular endothelial cells, causing excessive activation of the immune system and cytokine storm, causing thrombosis Increased prothrombotic factors such as antiphospholipid antibodies, elevated factor VIII, high fibrinogen, circulating prothrombotic microparticles, neutrophil extracellular traps have been reported in COVID19 infection It has been argued that complementmediated endothelial damage, increase in proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin IL1, IL6, IL8 and interferonγ may be the cause of thrombosis Autopsies of patients with COVID19 revealed that the causes of death were pneumonia and pulmonary embolism When monitoring COVID19 patients, platelet, prothrombin time PT and activated partial thromboplastin time aPTT, fibrinogen and Ddimer monitoring should be initiated every 12 days, especially in critically ill patients High Ddimer levels are associated with high mortality may indicate infectionsepsis, cytokine storm, and impending organ failure Disseminated intravascular coagulation DIC may be seen in COVID19 patients, but unlike DIC, fibrinogen is usually high Clotting times and platelet counts are usually normal Therefore, it is appropriate to use sepsisinduced coagulopathy SIC criteria in the followup of COVID19 patients Infected areas related to pulmonary embolism can be seen as radiological appearance Some patients may have enlarged subsegmental pulmonary vessels Treatment of the underlying disease is the most important treatment for all coagulopathies Patients with venous thromboembolism, inpatient medical, surgical, and COVID19 therapy should receive anticoagulant therapy unless there is a contraindication to anticoagulation for example, active bleeding or severe bleeding within the previous 24 to 48 hours,OBJECTIVES The authors sought to 1 characterize the rationale underpinning anesthesiologists use of various perioperative strategies hypothesized to affect renal function in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery, 2 characterize existing belief about the quality of evidence addressing the renal impact of these strategies, and 3 identify potentially renoprotective strategies for which anesthesiologists would most value a detailed, evidencebased review DESIGN Survey of perioperative practice in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery SETTING Online survey PARTICIPANTS Members of the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists SCA INTERVENTIONS None MEASUREMENTS  MAIN RESULTS The survey was distributed to more than 2,000 SCA members and completed in whole or in part by 202 respondents Selection of target intraoperative blood pressure and relative hypotension avoidance was the strategy most frequently reported to reflect belief about its potential renal effect 79 95 CI 7285 Most respondents believed the evidence supporting an effect on renal injury of intraoperative target blood pressure during cardiac surgery was of high or moderate quality Other factors, including a specific nonrenal rationale, surgeon preference, department or institutionlevel decisions, tradition, or habit, also frequently were reported to affect decision making across queried strategies Potential renoprotective strategies most frequently requested for inclusion in a subsequent detailed, evidencebased review were intraoperative target blood pressure and choice of vasopressor agent to achieve target pressure CONCLUSIONS A large number of perioperative strategies are believed to variably affect renal injury in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery, with wide variation in perceived quality of evidence for a renal effect of these strategies,OBJECTIVES To investigate the associations of household mold and pesticide use with risk of childhood asthma and examine the potential effect modification by childs sex at a national level in the US METHODS Nationally representative data were drawn from the crosssectional 2017 and 2018 National Surveys of Childrens Health Household mold and pesticide exposures during the past 12 months and physiciandiagnosed childhood asthma were assessed by standard questionnaires administered to primary caregivers Multivariable logistic regression models were used to calculate adjusted odds ratios aOR for current asthma, adjusting for child, caregiver, and household covariates We also examined potential effect modification by childs sex Sampling weights accounted for the complex survey design RESULTS Among 41,423 US children in 20172018, the weighted prevalence of current asthma was 108 in household moldexposed children, compared with 72 in nonexposed children P,Background and Objectives The Investigation of Palpitations in the ED IPED study showed that a smartphonebased event recorder increased the number of patients in whom an electrocardiogram ECG was captured during symptoms over fivefold to more than 55 at 90 days compared to standard care and concluded that this safe, noninvasive and easytouse device should be considered part of ongoing care to all patients presenting acutely with unexplained palpitations or presyncope This study reports the process of establishing a smartphone palpitation and presyncope ambulatory care Clinic SPACC service Materials and Methods A clinical standard operating procedure SOP was devised, and funding was secured through a business case for the purchase of 40 AliveCor devices in the first instance The clinic was launched on 22 July 2019 Results Between 22 July 2019 and 31 October 2019, 68 patients seen in the emergency departments EDs with palpitations or presyncope were referred to SPACC Of those, 30 were male and 38 were female, and the mean age was 458 years old SD 151 with a range from 18 years old to 80 years old A total of 50 74 patients underwent full investigation On the first assessment, seven 10 patients were deemed to have noncardiac palpitations and were not fitted with the device All patients who underwent full investigation achieved symptomatic rhythm correlation most with sinus rhythm, ventricular ectopics, or bigeminy A symptomatic cardiac dysrhythmia was detected in six 88 patients Three patients had supraventricular tachycardia 4, two had atrial fibrillation 3, and one had atrial flutter 2 Qualitative feedback from the SPACC team suggested several areas where improvement to the clinic could be made Conclusion We believe a smartphone palpitation service based on ambulatory care is simple to implement and is effective at detecting cardiac dysrhythmia in ED palpitation patients,Acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS is a fatal condition with insufficiently clarified etiology Supportive care for severe hypoxemia remains the mainstay of essential interventions for ARDS In recent years, adequate ventilation to prevent ventilatorinduced lung injury VILI and patient selfinflicted lung injury PSILI as well as lungprotective mechanical ventilation has an increasing attention in ARDSVentilationperfusion mismatch may augment severe hypoxemia and inspiratory drive and consequently induce PSILI Respiratory drive and effort must also be carefully monitored to prevent PSILI Airway occlusion pressure P01 and airway pressure deflection during an endexpiratory airway occlusion Pocc could be easy indicators to evaluate the respiratory drive and effort Patientventilator dyssynchrony is a time mismatching between patients effort and ventilator drive Although it is frequently unrecognized, dyssynchrony can be associated with poor clinical outcomes Dyssynchrony includes trigger asynchrony, cycling asynchrony, and flow delivery mismatch Ventilatorinduced diaphragm dysfunction VIDD is a form of iatrogenic injury from inadequate use of mechanical ventilation Excessive spontaneous breathing can lead to PSILI, while excessive rest can lead to VIDD Optimal balance between these two manifestations is probably associated with the etiology and severity of the underlying pulmonary diseaseHighflow nasal cannula HFNC and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation NPPV are noninvasive techniques for supporting hypoxemia While they are beneficial as respiratory supports in mild ARDS, there can be a risk of delaying needed intubation Mechanical ventilation and ECMO are applied for more severe ARDS However, as with HFNCNPPV, inappropriate assessment of breathing workload potentially has a risk of delaying the timing of shifting from ventilator to ECMO Various methods of oxygen administration in ARDS are important However, it is also important to evaluate whether they adequately reduce the breathing workload and help to improve ARDS,Randomized controlled trials have suggested that vitamin D supplementation can prevent asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD exacerbations For COPD, the benefit appears to be limited to individuals with baseline 25hydroxyvitamin D 25OHD levels 25 nmolL We performed a post hoc analysis of data from a randomized, doubleblinded, placebocontrolled trial to investigate the effect that monthly, highdose vitamin D supplementation versus placebo had on older adults with asthma andor COPD Specifically, we investigated whether vitamin D supplementation prevented exacerbations of these conditions Participants were randomly assigned either to an initial oral dose of 200,000 IU vitamin D3 followed by 100,000 IU monthly or to placebo, with an average followup period of 33 years Among the 5110 participants, 775 had asthma or COPD at the beginning of the study, and were eligible for inclusion in this analysis Exacerbations were defined by the prescription of a shortburst of oral corticosteroids The mean age of the participants was 67 years old, and 56 were male The mean baseline blood 25OHD level was 63 nmolL 23 were 25 nmolL Overall, we found that vitamin D supplementation did not affect the exacerbation risk hazard ratio 108 95CI 084139 Among those with baseline 25OHD 25 nmolL, however, the hazard ratio was 011 95CI 002051 p for interaction  0001 Although monthly vitamin D supplementation had no overall impact on risk of exacerbations of asthma or COPD, we found evidence of a probable benefit among those with severe vitamin D deficiency,,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 SARSCoV2, the cause of COVID19, is reported to increase the rate of mortality worldwide COVID19 is associated with acute respiratory symptoms as well as blood coagulation in the vessels thrombosis, heart attack and stroke Given the requirement of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ACE2 receptor for SARSCoV2 entry into host cells, here we discuss how the downregulation of ACE2 in the COVID19 patients and virusinduced shift in ACE2 catalytic equilibrium, change the concentrations of substrates such as angiotensin II, apelin13, dynorphin13, and products such as angiotensin 17, angiotensin 19, apelin12, dynorphin12 in the human body Substrates accumulation ultimately induces inflammation, angiogenesis, thrombosis, neuronal and tissue damage while diminished products lead to the loss of the antiinflammatory, antithrombotic and antiangiogenic responses In this review, we focus on the viralinduced imbalance between ACE2 substrates and products which exacerbates the severity of COVID19 Considering the roadmap, we propose multiple therapeutic strategies aiming to rebalance the products of ACE2 and to ameliorate the symptoms of the disease,SARSCOV2 infection has swiftly become a pandemic disease of historic relevance and widely variable outcomes This variable prognosis is related both to uneven damage, among others, to lungs, heart and kidneys, and to a multisystemic inflammatory reaction All these factors are known to disrupt water balance and potentially induce hyponatraemia or hypernatraemia Water balance disorders are known mortality and morbidity risk factors in several clinical scenarios and their proper management, though often complex and hazardous, can reduce mortality and length of hospitalization Clinical uncertainty over COVID19 outcome, the variety of organs involved in both the infection and water balance and difficulties in clinical examination due to risk of contagion might obstruct proper management of dysnatremic disorders Thus, the Acqua Neuroendocrinology Group of the Spanish Society for Endocrinology SEEN has endeavoured to provide evidence and expert based recommendations on the management of hyponatraemia and hypernatraemia in COVID19 patients,BackgroundNovel coronavirus disease 2019 has been stated as global disease pandemic due to its rapid spread worldwide Up to 30 of coronavirus disease 2019 patients with hypertension are more susceptible to death Angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have been used as primary line of medication for hypertension nonetheless, conflicting data arises as numerous studies showed contradictory resultsMain bodyAiming to show clinical outcome of reninangiotensinaldosterone system blockers in hospital treatment of hypertensive patients with coronavirus disease 2019, systematically searched literatures through five databases were intensively appraised using The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation checklists for cohort studies Based on the result evaluation from retrospective cohorts involving more than 15,000 patients across Asia and other regions of the world, ten encompassed studies divided into two subgroups in this metareview showed that inhospital hypertensive coronavirus disease 2019 patients receiving antihypertensive drugs were associated with overall risk reduction in subgroup 1 hazard ratio, HR  096, 95 CI  082112 to no outcome association of allcause mortalities in subgroup 2 HR  026, 95 CI  019034 All appraised studies in synergism showed that mortality outcomes were not augmented with the employment of either ACE inhibitor or ARB in subjectsConclusionTherefore, the results support recommendation by the American Heart Association not to discontinue angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker regimens in coronavirus disease 2019 patients with hypertension,INTRODUCTION Olfactory dysfunction OD affects a majority of COVID19 patients, is atypical in duration and recovery, and is associated with focal opacification and inflammation of the olfactory epithelium Given recent increased emphasis on airborne transmission of SARSCoV2, the purpose of the present study was to experimentally characterize aerosol dispersion within olfactory epithelium OE and respiratory epithelium RE in human subjects, to determine if small sub 5μm airborne aerosols selectively deposit in the OE METHODS Healthy adult volunteers inhaled fluoresceinlabeled nebulized 055μm airborne aerosol or atomized larger aerosolized droplets 30100μm Particulate deposition in the OE and RE was assessed by bluelight filter modified rigid endoscopic evaluation with subsequent image randomization, processing and quantification by a blinded reviewer RESULTS 055μm airborne aerosol deposition, as assessed by fluorescence gray value, was significantly higher in the OE than the RE bilaterally, with minimal to no deposition observed in the RE maximum fluorescence OE 195IQR 225, RE 1IQR 32, p0001 average fluorescence OE 23IQR 45, RE 01IQR 02, p001 Conversely, larger 30100μm aerosolized droplet deposition was significantly greater in the RE than the OE maximum fluorescence OE 13IQR 143, RE 38IQR 455, p001 average fluorescence OE 19IQR 21, RE 59IQR 59, p001 CONCLUSIONS Our data experimentally confirm that despite bypassing the majority of the upper airway, smallsized 055μm airborne aerosols differentially deposit in significant concentrations within the olfactory epithelium This provides a compelling aerodynamic mechanism to explain atypical OD in COVID19,Although lung innervation has been described by many studies in humans and rodents, the regulation of the respiratory system induced by neurotrophins is not fully understood Here, we review current knowledge on the role of neurotrophins and the expression and function of their receptors in neurogenesis, vasculogenesis and during the embryonic development of the respiratory tree and highlight key implications relevant to respiratory diseases,Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 increases the risk of several cardiovascular diseases CVDs such as acute myocardial injury Vascular dysfunctions are important drivers of CVDs A variety of risk factors promotes the development and progression of CVDs including, overweight and obesity, arterial hypertension, physical inactivity, smoking, unhealthy diet, overconsumption of alcohol, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus However, nearly all of these risk factors are modifiable by antihypertensive, antidiabetic, or lipidlowering medication and lifestyle changes Other factors such as age or genetic factors cannot be modified Moreover, infection and inflammation have been shown to increase the risk of CVDs The COVID19 pandemic yielded a new perspective to this field Cardiometabolic events, diseases, risk factors and COVID19 are strongly intertwined An increased CVDs risk through multifactorial mechanisms has been observed in COVID19 patients Furthermore, a higher rate of infection with COVID19, severe COVID19, and bad outcome has been demonstrated in patients with established cardiometabolic disorders and vascular risk factors Summary at present, we suggest that regular interactions between healthcare professionals and patients should include education on COVID19 and on primary and secondary vascular prevention in order to minimize the burden of the virus in our susceptible populations Keywords Cardiometabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases, inflammation, atherosclerosis, COVID19,,Venous thromboembolism, occlusion of dialysis catheters, circuit thrombosis in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ECMO devices, acute limb ischemia, and isolated strokes, all in the face of prophylactic and even therapeutic anticoagulation, are features of novel coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 coagulopathy It seems well established at this time that a COVID19 patient deemed sick enough to be hospitalized, should receive at least prophylactic dose anticoagulation However, should some hospitalized patients have dosage escalation to intermediate dose Should some be considered for fulldose anticoagulation without a measurable thromboembolic event and how should that anticoagulation be monitored Should patients receive postdischarge anticoagulation and with what medication and for how long What thrombotic issues are related to the various medications being used to treat this coagulopathy Is antiphospholipid antibody part of this syndrome What is the significance of isolated ischemic stroke and limb ischemia in this disorder and how does this interface with the rest of the clinical and laboratory features of this disorder The aims of this article are to explore these questions and interpret the available data based on the current evidence,,BackgroundInterstitial lung disease ILD comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by multifocal diffuse lung involvement Similarly, COVID19 has varied multispectral organ involvement Patients with underlying ILD and coexistent COVID19 infection may lead to an acute blow to the already deceased lungCase presentationA 58yearold man presented with fever and cough with expectoration for the past 4u2009days associated with breathlessness He was a smoker and alcoholic for the past 20u2009years His saturation was low in room air around 84 and improved to 98 with 10 lmin of nasal oxygen Further investigation shows acute deterioration of ILDConclusionCOVID19 infection has a spectrum of manifestations Acute deterioration of ILD is rarely reported in the literature Etiology should be investigated further,Abstract  Funding Acknowledgements Type of funding sources None   Background Repeated echocardiographic assessment of cardiac function is integral in management of intensive care units ICU patients Machine learning ML can assist by integrating wholecardiac cycle echo data derived from flow assessment and deformation imaging, and grouping patients on the basis of patterns of cardiac dysfunction and its evolution over time Cardiac involvement has been suggested to be important in COVID19 outcome and echo evaluation can inform on cardiac status We use unsupervised ML to investigate and integrate longitudinal data from the COVIDHO study NCT04371679 to determine the potential of tracking changes in cardiac function during ICU hospitalizationxa0   Methods In a singlecentre, COVID19 patients n  38 were prospectively followed with echocardiography as part of ICU management The endpoint was defined as death or ICU discharge LV myocardial deformation, as well as aortic, mitral and pulmonary artery bloodpool Doppler velocity profiles were used as input for ML Clinical data was used to validate the ML derived phenotypes Echo data from the initial and final echo examination were used to create an output space where participants were positioned based on cardiac function blinded to outcome status Regression was used to estimate the echo and clinical characteristics of different regions in the space Patient trajectories in the output space were investigated for each patient   Results Endpoint was not reached in 24 n  9 at the time of analysis The cohort was 68 male, aged 65  12 years, and with an ICU mortality 21 n  8 The median spent in ICU was 10 IQR 718 days The ML analysis demonstrated a heterogeneous output space Fig 1A we could define a gradual change in the shape of the pulmonary outflow velocity profile, from a normalxa0 towards pulmonary hypertension Fig 1A, x axis Jointly with differences in diastolic function mitral inflow fusion and A wave accentuation defined two regions with signs of pulmonary hypertension gray and with normal pulmonary pressures but LV diastolic dysfunction yellow Investigation of patient trajectories Fig 1B demonstrated the feasibility of tracking changes during ICU hospitalization, showing a shift of a patient that died in the ICU, from initial diastolic dysfunction towards pulmonary hypertension red, and a patient shifting from a region with normal diastolic function towards pulmonary hypertension, but with a positive outcome blue Echo data concurs with observed dynamics Fig 1C and 1D   Conclusion ML can integrate complex, wholecardiac cycle echo data to group heterogeneous patients based on similarity of cardiac function Patient trajectories across the output space demonstrate the feasibility of ML for echo databased followup of patients during ICU hospitalization Further echo and clinical data integration can improve characterisation of the output space regions and better define changes in cardiac function during hospitalization Abstract Figure 1,Methamphetamineinduced lung injury is a very rare entity and is poorly understood due to the paucity of available literature It can present with respiratory failure, often requiring immediate ventilatory support and conservative management Secondary bacterial infection can result from smoking contaminated crystalline methamphetamine Although there is growing evidence for the use of steroids in acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS, the literature is limited regarding cases of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema due to meth use We present a case of ARDS due to methamphetamine use, which dramatically resolved with ventilatory supportxa0A low threshold to investigate druginduced lung injuryxa0in

company Main funding sources Study sponsored by DiA Imaging Analysis   Background xa0The assessment of the right ventricularxa0RVxa0functionxa0is an essential part of every transthoracic echocardiographic examination It plays an importantxa0rolexa0in the diagnosis and management of many diseases and conditions In covid19 patients, there is evidence showing that enlarged RV and abnormal Free Wall Strain FWS correlate with high mortality Assessment of the RV in the Point of Care settings can assist the differential diagnosis and provide important clinical information in early stages, close to the onset of symptoms, however, it is done qualitatively by visual estimation and thus subjective and requires high level of expertise The presented study aims to validate the use of a novel artificial intelligence tool LVivo RV by DiA imaging analysis that uses deep learning and image processing algorithms to automatically evaluate RV size and function from apical 4 chamber 4CH focused or modified ultrasound clips   Methods xa0A retrospective study of 100 patients who underwent routine echocardiographic examination was conducted in three medical centers in US and Israel The apical 4CH focused or modified clips were interpreted by experts to evaluate RV size and function The End Diastolic Area EDA measured manually by two sonographers and the FWS measured by semiautomated Velocity Vector Imaging software VVI by Siemens were compared to the same parameters obtained automatically by the LVivo RV, using linear regression and Bland Altman analysis   Results xa0100 cases were included, 39 females and 61 males Mean age was 647 1992 Mean BMI was 281 68176 74 had pulmonary hypertension and 19 had lung disease 36 were considered abnormal by their fractional area change values and 64 were considered normal Three cases were noninterpretable by the physicians thus excluded from the analysis The LVivo RV was able to process 99 of the cases Excellent correlation was obtained for EDA between the sonographers average of manual measurements and the automated EDA by LVivo RV with r  092 p  00001, 95CI 088094 The bias and limits of agreement for EDA were 087  576cm2 For FWS, 4 cases were manually excluded due to insufficient image quality The Bland Altman analysis for FWS showed small bias and limits of agreement of 07  122 A very good correlation of r 078, 95 CI 069085 was found, indicating good compatibility between the methods The specificity and sensitivity for FWS werexa080 and 77 respectively, using an optimal cutoff value of 16, and the overall agreement was 79   Conclusions xa0The performance of LVivo RV demonstrated a very good agreement with manual and semiautomated quantitative methods for RV assessment LVivo RV provides fast, accurate, objective and reproducible results and has the potential to be used at the Point of Care settings as a powerful tool for RV size and function evaluation Abstract Figure,Abstract Commercially available health technologies such as smartphones and smartwatches, activity trackers and eHealth applications, commonly referred to as wearables, are increasingly available and used both in the leisure and healthcare sector for pulse and fitnessactivity tracking The aim of the Position Paper is to identify specific barriers and knowledge gaps for the use of wearables, in particular for heart rate and activity tracking, in clinical cardiovascular healthcare to support their implementation into clinical care The widespread use of heart rate and fitness tracking technologies provides unparalleled opportunities for capturing physiological information from large populations in the community, which has previously only been available in patient populations in the setting of healthcare provision The availability of lowcost and highvolume physiological data from the community also provides unique challenges While the number of patients meeting healthcare providers with data from wearables is rapidly growing, there are at present no clinical guidelines on how and when to use data from wearables in primary and secondary prevention Technical aspects of heart rate tracking especially during activity need to be further validated How to analyze, translate, and interpret large datasets of information into clinically applicable recommendations needs further consideration While the current users of wearable technologies tend to be young, healthy and in the higher sociodemographic strata, wearables could potentially have a greater utility in the elderly and higher risk population Wearables may also provide a benefit through increased health awareness, democratization of health data and patient engagement Use of continuous monitoring may provide opportunities for detection of risk factors and disease development earlier in the causal pathway, which may provide novel applications in both prevention and clinical research However, wearables may also have potential adverse consequences due to unintended modification of behaviour, uncertain use and interpretation of large physiological data, a possible increase in social inequality due to differential access and technological literacy, challenges with regulatory bodies and privacy issues In the present position paper, current applications as well as specific barriers and gaps in knowledge are identified and discussed in order to support the implementation of wearable technologies from gadgetology into clinical cardiology,BackgroundBreath contains an aerosol of droplet particles, which are formed from the epithelial lining fluid when the small airways close and reopen during inhalation succeeding a full expiration These particles can be collected by impaction using the PExA method Particles in Exhaled Air, and constitute a potential source of biomarkers reflecting pathological processes in the small airwaysObjectiveOur aim was to investigate if PExA method may be useful for discovery of biomarkers that reflect pathology of small airwaysMethods10 healthy controls and 20 subjects with asthma, of whom 10 with small airway involvement as indicated by a high lung clearance index LCI 29 zscore, were examined using the PExA instrument The samples were analysed with the SOMAscan proteomics platform SomaLogic IncResultsTwo hundredseven proteins were detected in up to 80 of the samples Nine proteins showed differential abundance in subjects with asthma and high LCI as compared to healthy controls Two of these were less abundant ALDOA4, C4, and seven more abundant FIGF, SERPINA1, CD93, CCL18, F10, IgM, IL1RAP sRAGE levels were lower in exsmokers n14 than in never smokers n16 Gene Ontology GO annotation database analyses revealed that the PEx proteome is enriched in extracellular proteins associated with extracellular exosomevesicles and innate immunityConclusionThe applied analytical method was reproducible and allowed identification of pathologically interesting proteins in PEx samples from asthmatic subjects with high LCI The results suggest that PEx based proteomics is an novel and promising approach to study respiratory diseases with small airway involvement,Background In December 2019, pneumonia cases of unknown cause were announced in Wuhan, China The causative agent of pneumonia was identified as coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2, and the disease was named coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 Purpose To evaluate the usefulness of computed thoracic tomography CT and postero anterior PA thoracic radiography in patients with COVID19 Material and Methods Between March and June 2020, the patients who arrived at our hospital with suspicion of COVID19 were retrospectively analyzed Thorax CT findings of the 281 patients 142 females and 139 males age range 391 years with positive PCR tests were evaluated Lesions in the lung parenchyma were examined according to their number, localization, and distribution PA chest radiograms were classified into two groups, positive and negative for the lung parenchymal lesions Results Of the total 281 patients with PCRpositive COVID19, CT examinations were normal in 107 381, and positive CT findings for pneumonia were found in 174 patients 619 Bilateral involvement was observed in 100 575 of the 174 patients with positive CT findings, and unilateral involvement was observed in 74 425 of them According to the localization of the lesions, peripheral subpleural distribution occurred in 160 of the 174 patients 919 The most common lesion was the ground glass opacities GGO In 77 of 281 PCRpositive patients 274, pulmonary lesions were found on PA chest radiograms Conclusion The presence of bilateral posterior subpleural GGO, nodule, and consolidation in thoracic CT are significant in terms of COVID19 pneumonia,We describe a 16yearold asymptomatic male who presented with coronary artery dilation z scoreu2009u200923 identified on echo performed solely for presence of COVID19 antibodies This case raises the question of whether cardiac screening should be considered for all patients with a history of COVID19,The number of publications studying the therapeutic use of stem cells has steadily increased since 2000 Compared to other applications, there has been little interest in the evaluation of mesenchymal stem cells MSCs and MSCderived products mostly extracellular vesicles for the treatment of respiratory diseases Due to the lack of efficient treatments for acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2, the action of MSCs has also been studied This review describes mode of action and use of MSCs and MSCderived products in the treatment of lung diseases including the respective advantages and limitations of the products Further, issues related to standardized production are addressed Administration by inhalation of MSCs, compared to intravenous injection, could decrease cell damage by shear stress, eliminate the barrier to reach target cells in the alveoli, prevent thrombus formation in the pulmonary vasculature and retention in filter for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation There is more feasible to deliver extracellular vesicles than MSCs with inhalers, offering the advantage of noninvasive and repeated administration by the patient Major obstacles for comparison of results are heterogeneity of the products, differences in the treatment protocols and small study cohorts,Background  COVID19 has led to over 1 million deaths worldwide and has been associated with cardiac complications including cardiac arrhythmias The incidence and pathophysiology of these manifestations remain elusive In this worldwide survey of patients hospitalized with COVID19 who developed cardiac arrhythmias, we describe clinical characteristics associated with various arrhythmias, as well as global differences in modulations of routine electrophysiology practice during the pandemic Methods  We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients hospitalized with COVID19 infection worldwide with and without incident cardiac arrhythmias Patients with documented atrial fibrillation AF, atrial flutter AFL, supraventricular tachycardia SVT, nonsustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia VT, ventricular fibrillation VF, atrioventricular block AVB, or marked sinus bradycardia HR40bpm were classified as having arrhythmia Deidentified data was provided by each institution and analyzed Results  Data was collected for 4,526 patients across 4 continents and 12 countries, 827 of whom had an arrhythmia Cardiac comorbidities were common in patients with arrhythmia 69 had hypertension, 42 diabetes mellitus, 30 had heart failure and 24 coronary artery disease Most had no prior history of arrhythmia Of those who did develop an arrhythmia, the majority 818 developed atrial arrhythmias, 207 developed ventricular arrhythmias, and 226 had bradyarrhythmia Regional differences suggested a lower incidence of AF in Asia compared to other continents 34 vs 63 Most patients in in North America and Europe received hydroxychloroquine, though the frequency of hydroxychloroquine therapy was constant across arrhythmia types Fortythree percent of patients who developed arrhythmia were mechanically ventilated and 51 survived to hospital discharge Many institutions reported drastic decreases in electrophysiology procedures performed Conclusions  Cardiac arrhythmias are common and associated with high morbidity and mortality among patients hospitalized with COVID19 infection There were significant regional variations in the types of arrhythmias and treatment approaches,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19, is a pandemic that has taken the world by storm We present the only contemporary reported case of COVID19 myocarditis leading to recovery with utilization of biventricular Impella Abiomed, Danvers, MA, USA for temporary mechanical circulatory support A 35yearold female with systemic sclerosis who was found to have five days of generalized malaise associated with fevers and cough She tested positive for COVID19 via nasal polymerase chain reaction Cardiac enzymes were found elevated on admission Invasive hemodynamics assessment was significant for elevated right and leftsided filling pressures, along with calculated cardiac index of 13 Lminm2 Decision was made to place right and leftsided ventricular support with percutaneous Impella for mechanical circulatory support She was started on intravenous immunoglobulin for suspected COVID19 myocarditis along with remdesivir and solumedrol After two weeks of continuous temporary mechanical circulatory support, the patients hemodynamics improved and she was discharged Repeat echocardiogram demonstrated normalization of left ventricular function,The coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 creates a significant burden on the cardiovascular system Moreover, diagnosing coronary artery disease in patients with COVID19 may be clinically challenging Herein, we present a case of inhospital stent thrombosis and thrombotic occlusion of the right coronary artery after initial revascularization and adherence to antiplatelet therapy,The aim of the study was to evaluate the immediate results of treatment of highrisk PE developed against the background of COVID19, and to analyze the features of the clinical course  Material and methods The study is based on the experience  of treatment applied to three patients with pulmonary embolism PE that developed against the background of COVID19  The group under consideration is represented by males The average age was 41  31 years old Verification of the primary  diagnosis of COVID19 was based on positive results of polymerase chain reaction, supplemented by the results of computed  tomography The formation of highrisk PE was noted on the 5th7th day from the moment of hospitalization There was also  a decrease in SO 2 below 85, РаО 2 — below 76 mm Hg, Borg index  8, which required noninvasive highflow ventilation  Catheterization of the right chambers of the heart with a SwanGanz catheter revealed an increase in systolic pressure in  the right ventricle to 57  12 mm Hg, and diastolic pressure to 13  034 mm Hg Pulmonary hypertension increased up to  70 mm Hg Changes in the biochemical analysis of blood consisted in increasing the level of troponin I to 065  014 ngml,  С reactive protein — to 542  21 mgl, and creatine phosphokinase — to 324  231 units An increase in the Ddimer level  was observed 068  011 mgl Systemic thrombolysis actilyse was performed in all the cases  Results Positive clinical  dynamics was observed up to 15 hours after thrombolytic therapy The level of SO 2 came back to the initial values and was  in the range 9396 and RaO 2 — from 8692 mm Hg by the end of the first day after the intervention The average pressure  gradient in the pulmonary artery was 32  412 mm Hg at the time of discharge, and at the peak — 44  53 mm Hg,Vessel Plus is an open acccess journal, which publishes articles related to vascular diseases, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, aneurysm, atherosclerosis, hypertension, stroke, peripheral vascular or pulmonary vascular diseases, etc,,BACKGROUND Bitter tastants can activate bitter taste receptors TAS2Rs and thus initiate relaxation of airway smooth muscle cells ASMCs, which have great potential in the development of novel bronchodilator drugs for asthma therapy However, the canonical bitter substance, denatonium is known to induce apoptosis of airway epithelial cells AECs, indicating that other bitter tastants may also impair the epithelial integrity to prevent hazardous particulate matters such as coronaviruses Therefore, any bitter tastants intended for treating airway disease should be carefully evaluated for potential toxicity to AECs HYPOTHESISPURPOSE Considering the vast diversity of bitter tastants in nature and different types of TAS2Rs expressed in airway cells, we hypothesized that there must be some natural bitter tastants to be not only potent in inducing relaxation of ASMCs but also unharmful to AECs STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Here we evaluated a group of bitter flavonoids that are derived from fruits and commonly used in traditional herbal medicine, including apigenin, hesperetin, kaempferol, naringenin, quercetin, and naringin, for their effects on the proliferation of human airway epitheliallike 16HBE14o, BEAS2B, and A549 cells cultured in vitro Cell proliferation and associated signaling pathways were assessed by cell counting, ATP assay, cell cycling assay, quantitative RTPCR, Fluo4 labeling, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer, respectively RESULTS The results show that five of the six tested bitter tastants inhibited, but only naringin promoted the proliferation of the 16HBE14o, BEAS2B, and A549 cells at the dose of a few hundred micromoles Furthermore, the naringinpromoted proliferation of the 16HBE14o cells was associated with enhanced cell cycle progression, mRNA expression of cyclin E, and evoked calcium signalingERK signaling, which were all attenuated by inhibition of the TAS2R signaling pathways with specific blockers CONCLUSION These findings indicate that although the majority of the bitter flavonoids may inhibit the proliferation of AECs, naringin emerged as one to promote the proliferation of AECs via cell cycle progression and TAS2Ractivated intracellular signaling It suggests that naringin and not a few other bitter tastants can be proven with nontoxicity to the airway epithelial structure and function, which provides further confidence in the development of safe and effective TAS2Rbased bronchodilators for asthma therapy,The need for collaborative research networks as an effective way forward to improve diagnosis and care of rare inherited diseases is constantly highlighted and primary ciliary dyskinesia PCD is no exception PCD affects 1 in 10 000 people and is genetically and clinically heterogeneous Dysfunction of motile cilia, caused by defects in one of more than 50 genes, leads to poor mucociliary clearance and progressive upper and lower respiratory disease Clinical symptoms include neonatal respiratory distress, chronic lung disease with bronchiectasis, rhinosinusitis and hearing impairment, and also infertility and laterality defects 50 of patients have situs inversus and 612 have other defects, such as congenital cardiac disease 1, 2 The BEATPCD ERS CRC is a large multidisciplinary network of researchers and healthcare professionals aiming to advance clinical and translational research in different areas of primary ciliary dyskinesia building upon previous collaborative initiatives httpsbitly39h3veZ,Aneurysms and occlusive pathologies of the aorta are frequently associated with atherosclerosis however, thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm accompanied by Leriche syndrome is an extremely rare condition with challenging treatment strategy and without established surgical treatment protocols In this report, we present our treatment strategy in a 64yearold male patient with ischemic heart disease and type 5 thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm accompanied by Leriche syndrome,While the incidence of thrombotic complications in critically ill patients is very high, in patients under noninvasive respiratory support NIS is still unknown The specific incidence of thrombotic events in each of the clinical scenarios within the broad spectrum of severity of COVID19, is not clearly established, and this has not allowed the implementation of thromboprophylaxis or anticoagulation for routine care in COVID19 Patients admitted in a semicritical unit treated initially with NIS, especially ContinuousPositive Airway Pressure CPAP, were included in the study The cumulative incidence of pulmonary embolism was analyzed and compared between patients with good response to NIS and patients with clinical deterioration that required orotracheal intubation 93 patients were included and 16 required mechanical ventilation MV after the NIS The crude cumulative incidence of the PE was 14 95, CI 822 for all group In patients that required orotracheal intubation and MV, the cumulative incidence was significantly higher 33 95, CI 1658 compared to patients that continued with noninvasive support 11 CI 518 LogRank, pxa0xa00013 Patients that required mechanical ventilation were at higher risk of PE for a HR of 43 95CI 1216 In conclusion, cumulative incidence of PE is remarkably higher in critically patients with a potential impact in COVID19 evolution In this context, patients under NIS are a very highrisk group for developing PE without a clear strategy regarding thromboprophylaxis,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 is the etiological agent for the COVID19 infectious disease that spreads via the respiratory route and has reached a drastic level of a global pandemic Symptoms of COVID19 may vary from mild fever, dry cough, shortness of breath to severe pneumonialike respiratory symptoms as exacerbation of disease occurs Unlike SARSCoV, the SARSCoV2 has a higher binding affinity to ACE2 receptors which signify its higher transmission rate from person to person Even though ACE2 is significant in the reninangiotensinaldosterone system RAAS regulation that exhibits protection to various organs, they play a significant role in COVID19 disease pathogenesis Viral interferences with the ACE2 peptidase activity are found in SARSCoV2 infected patients leading to proinflammatory responses, hypertension and multiorgan damage Angiotensinconverting enzyme2 is constrained to a variety of organ systems but surface ACE2 receptors on lung epithelia are largely affected, that lead to pathological alterations in lung histology which may progress to respiratory failure The viral tropism mainly occurs by the attachment to the angiotensinconverting enzymes2 receptors in the host cell, thus drugs targeting ACE2 expressions may arise as the future therapeutic strategy to combat COVID19 infectionsThe innovative approach of repurposing of drugs has shown temporary effectiveness to the rising pandemic This article mainly focuses on the prominence of ACE2 receptors which are expressed during the COVID infections and repurposing strategy of available drug therapies,Background COVID19 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infected patients have increased risk for thrombotic events, which initially may have been under recognized The existence of cardiovascular emboli can be directly life threatening when obstructing the blood flow to vital organs such as the brain or other parts of the body The exact mechanism for this hypercoagulable state in COVID19 patients yet remains to be elucidated Case summary A 72yearold man critically ill with COVID19 was diagnosed with a freefloating and mural thrombus in the thoracic aorta Subsequent distal embolization to the limbs led to ischaemia and necrosis of the right foot Treatment with heparin and anticoagulants reduced thrombus load in the ascending and thoracic aorta Discussion Onethird of COVID19 patients show major thrombotic events, mostly pulmonary emboli The endothelial expression of angiotensinconverting enzyme2 receptors makes it feasible that in patients with viraemia direct viraltoxicity to the endothelium of also the large arteries results in local thrombus formation Up to date, prophylactic anticoagulants are recommended in all patients that are hospitalized with COVID19 infections to prevent venous and arterial thrombotic complications,We report a case of fulminant liver failure in a patient with acute active hepatitis B infection who was found to have COVID19 without lung involvement A 24yearold male was brought by ambulance service to Hamad General Hospital, Emergency Department ED, in Doha on April 8, 2020, with chief complaints of fever and cough for 3 days Upon initial evaluation, the patient was febrile 394°C, jaundiced, and disoriented regarding time, place, and person, with an unremarkable past medical history Initial blood tests showed severely elevated urea, creatinine, transaminases, and ammonium in addition to an impaired coagulation profile consistent with fulminant liver failure A swab was taken for COVID19 PCR testing and found to be positive Serological tests revealed hepatitis B surface antigen positivity and other serology indicating acute hepatitis B Initial Xray and repeat chest Xrays did not show lung infiltrates On the 6th day after admission, the patient developed fixed dilated pupils, with brain edema on CT cardiac arrest occurred on the 10th day after admission, and the patient died Although it is still largely unclear, HBV0activated suddenonset strong cytotoxic T lymphocyte response and enhanced viral replication andor retention of the viral capsid in infected hepatocytes may cause the pathogenesis of FH These pathophysiological events cause extensive hepatocyte apoptosis and necrosis, which results in deadly severe liver failure Our findings support that the liver damage occurring in COVID19 is caused by an impaired innate immune system rather than by direct cell damage caused by SARSCoV2 We think that more consideration should be given to the presence of acute hepatitis B, especially in COVID19 patients,BACKGROUND During the COVID19 pandemic, decreasing rates of hospitalisations for cardiovascular disease raised concerns for undertreatment, particularly for vulnerable groups We investigated how the initial COVID19 public lockdown, impacted the risk of being hospitalised with a major cardiovascular event MCE myocardial infarctionstrokeheart failure according to educational level METHODS We grouped all Danish residents according to educational attainment level low, medium, high and age 4059, 6069, 70 years In each group, we calculated the agestandardised and sex standardised risk of MCE hospitalisation in the initial COVID19 lockdownperiod 13 March 20203 May 2020 and in the corresponding calendar period in 2019 We calculated agestandardised and sexstandardised risks to investigate whether the COVID19 lockdown had a differential effect on MCE incidence according to educational level RESULTS In the period in 2019, 2700 Danish residents were hospitalised with MCE, compared with only 2290 during the lockdown During lockdown, the risk of hospitalisation for MCE decreased among residents aged 70 with low education risk difference RD 462 732 192 per 100,000 or medium education RD 232 508 43 per 100 000, but not among residents with high education RD 51 323 425, per 100 000 The risk of hospitalisation for MCE did not decrease significantly for the younger age groups CONCLUSIONS The COVID19 lockdown is associated with a reduced incidence for MCE, especially among low educated, elderly residents This raises concern for undertreatment that without clinical awareness and action may widen the educational gap in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality,A previously healthy 40yearold man was referred to our emergency department with pruritic skin lesions and dyspnoea Laboratory investigation revealed hypereosinophilia Further diagnostic workup confirmed the diagnosis of idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome iHES, a rare myeloproliferative disease with a heterogeneous clinical presentation We describe a unique case with cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic and cutaneous involvement at time of presentation This case accentuates the importance of an extensive multidisciplinary diagnostic workup, since iHES is a condition with potential rapid progressive multiorgan failure which requires prompt analysis and treatment In addition, this case emphasises the importance of being aware of tunnel vision, especially during the COVID19 pandemic, which might give rise to an increased risk of missing rare diagnoses Our patient was treated with prednisolone, after which both his clinical condition and eosinophil concentrations markedly improved,BACKGROUND The prognostic value of pointofcare lung ultrasound has not been evaluated in a large cohort of patients with COVID19 admitted to general medicine ward in the United States The aim of this study was to describe lung ultrasound findings and their prognostic value in patients with COVID19 admitted to internal medicine ward METHOD This prospective observational study consecutively enrolled 105 hospitalized participants with COVID19 at 2 tertiary care centers Ultrasound was performed in 12 lung zones within 24 hours of admission Findings were assessed relative to 4 outcomes intensive care unit ICU need, need for intensive respiratory support, length of stay, and death RESULTS We detected abnormalities in 92 97105 of participants The common findings were confluent Blines 92, nonhomogenous pleural lines 78, and consolidations 54 Large confluent Blines, consolidations, bilateral involvement, and any abnormality in  6 areas were associated with a longer hospitalization and need for intensive respiratory support Large confluent Blines and bilateral involvement were also associated with ICU stay A total lung ultrasound score 5 had a negative predictive value of 100 for the need of intensive respiratory support A higher total lung ultrasound score was associated with ICU need median total 18 in the ICU group vs 11 nonICU, p  0004, a hospitalization  9d 15 vs 10, p  0016 and need for intensive respiratory support 18 vs 85, P  0001 CONCLUSIONS Most patients hospitalized with COVID19 had lung ultrasound abnormalities on admission and a higher lung ultrasound score was associated with worse clinical outcomes except death A low total lung ultrasound score 5 had a negative predictive value of 100 for the need of intensive respiratory support Pointofcare ultrasound can aid in the risk stratification for patients with COVID19 admitted to general wards,The uncontrolled spread of the COVID19 pandemic which originated in China created a global turmoil While the world is still busy figuring out a cure for the deadly disease, scientists worked out on many theories and conducted several studies to establish a relationship between the infection and other known diseases Cardiovascular diseases CVD are one of the major complications of this infection after the respiratory manifestations Individuals with cardiovascular complication are said to be more susceptible to acquiring the infection because the novel coronavirus uses the ACE2 receptor for its entry inside the cell and there is a high level of ACE2 expression in individuals with cardiovascular complications because of the enzymes antihypertrophic, antifibrotic and antihypertensive effects on the heart Individuals who belong to the older age group are also more susceptible Knowing the above information, it might seem that using ACE2 inhibitors would help to slow or prevent the entry of the novel coronavirus but it would also at the same time prove to have deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system as the protective functions of ACE2 would be lost While the search for a cure still continues it has been stated many a times that the conditions might worsen with time and the only way to keep ourselves and our family safe would be to follow the appropriate social distancing methods and get a COVID test if we experience any of the major symptoms,We present a 30yearold male, an 82yearold male and a 71yearold female who presented with fever, cough and dyspnea during de COVID19 pandemic Chest CT showed a groundglass opacification andor crazy paving In all of these patients the PCR for SARSCoV2 was negative, but the COVID19 pandemic caused a delay in diagnosis and treatment of these patients with big consequences for these patients We show the risk of being fixated on COVID19, the need for a careful examination respecting the medical history of the patient Dont conclude too quickly on a CORADS4 or 5, but do additional tests and consult other specialists when the PCR for SARSCoV2 is negative,,,The management of bronchial secretions is one of the main problems encountered in a wide spectrum of medical conditions ranging from respiratory disorders, neuromuscular disorders and patients undergoing either thoracic or abdominal surgery The purpose of this review is illustrate to the reader the different ACTs currently available and the related evidence present in literature Alongside methods with a strong background behind as postural drainage, manual techniques or PEP systems, the current orientation is increasingly aimed at devices that can mobilize and  or remove secretions Cough Assist, Vacuum Techniques, systems that modulate airflow have more and more scientific evidence Different principles combination is a new field of investigation that goes toward an increasing of clinical complexity that will facing us,Abstract  Background SARSCoV2, also known as COVID19, is a specific strain of coronavirus that is responsible for an ongoing global pandemic COVID19 primarily targets the respiratory system via droplet transmission, causing symptoms similar to influenza, including fever, cough, and shortness of breath It is now known to impact other organ systems, causing significant cardiovascular and gastrointestinal illness, among others   Case summary We describe two cases of COVID19 induced myocarditis presenting with cardiogenic shock These cases highlight the importance of understanding the lethal cardiac complications of COVID19 infection, as well as its presentation, diagnosis, pathophysiology, and potential treatment options These two cases involve patients without underlying cardiovascular disease risk factors who experienced prolonged symptoms of COVID19 infection Both patients presented with cardiogenic shock more than one week after symptom onset and diagnosis These cases demonstrate the late presentation of myocarditis and cardiogenic shock, treated with corticosteroids and inotropes, with subsequent recovery of cardiac function   Discussion The cases highlight the importance of recognizing late presentation viral myocarditis secondary to COVID19 infection, even in patients without underlying cardiac disease,,,An expanded myeloid cell compartment is a hallmark of severe coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 However, data regarding myeloid cell expansion have been collected in Europe, where the mortality rate by COVID19 is greater than those in other regions including Japan Thus, characteristics of COVID19induced myeloid cell subsets remain largely unknown in the regions with low mortality rates Here, we analyzed cellular dynamics of myeloidderived suppressor cell MDSC subsets and examined whether any of them correlate with disease severity and prognosis, using blood samples from Japanese COVID19 patients We observed that polymorphonuclear PMNMDSCs, but not other MDSC subsets, transiently expanded in severe cases but not in mild or moderate cases Contrary to previous studies in Europe, this subset selectively expanded in survivors of severe cases and subsided before discharge, but such transient expansion was not observed in nonsurvivors in Japanese cohort Analysis of plasma cytokinechemokine levels revealed positive correlation of PMNMDSC frequencies with interleukin 8 IL8 levels prior to the cell expansion, indicating the involvement of IL8 on recruitment of PMNMDSCs to peripheral blood following the onset of severe COVID19 Thus, our data indicates that transient expansion of the PMNMDSC subset results in improved clinical outcome Thus, this myeloid cell subset may be a predictor of prognosis in cases of severe COVID19 in Japan,BACKGROUND Limited epidemiological data are available on the outcomes of inhospital cardiac arrest CA in COVID19 patients METHODS We performed literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Ovid to identify research articles that studied outcomes of inhospital cardiac arrest in COVID19 patients The primary outcome was survival at discharge Secondary outcomes included return of spontaneous circulation ROSC and types of cardiac arrest Pooled percentages with a 95 confidence interval CI were calculated for the prevalence of outcomes RESULTS A total of 7,891 COVID patients were included in the study There were 621 pooled prevalence 8, 95 CI 413 cardiac arrest patients There were 52 pooled prevalence 30 95 CI 00100 patients that survived at the time of discharge ROSC was achieved in 202 pooled prevalence 3995 CI 210590 patients Mean time to ROSC was 774 95 CI 751798 min The commonest rhythm at the time of cardiac arrest was pulseless electrical activity pooled prevalence 46 95 1380, followed by asystole pooled prevalence 40 95 CI 680 Unstable ventricular arrhythmia occurred in a minority of patients pooled prevalence 8 95 CI 413 CONCLUSION This pooled analysis of studies showed that the survival post inhospital cardiac arrest in COVID patients is dismal despite adequate ROSC obtained at the time of resuscitation Nonshockable rhythm cardiac arrest is commoner suggesting a noncardiac cause while cardiac related etiology is uncommon Future studies are needed to improve the survival in these patients,Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID19 has been a global health crisis since it was first identified in December 2019 In addition to fever, cough, headache, and shortness of breath, an intense increase in immune responsebased inflammation has been the hallmark of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus SARSCoV2 virus infection This narrative review summarizes and critiques pathophysiology of COVID19xa0and its plausible effects on drug metabolism and disposition The release of inflammatory cytokines eg, interleukins, tumor necrosis factor α, also known as cytokine storm, leads to altered molecular pathophysiology and eventually organ damage in the lung, heart, and liver The laboratory values for various liver function tests eg, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, albumin have indicated potential hepatocellular injury in COVID19 patients Since the liver is the powerhouse of protein synthesis and the primary site of cytochrome P450 CYPmediated drug metabolism, even a minor change in the liver function status has the potential to affect the hepatic clearance of xenobiotics It has now been well established that extreme increases in cytokine levels are common in COVID19 patients, and previous studies with patients infected with nonSARSCoV2 virus have shown that CYP enzymes can be suppressed by an infectionrelated cytokine increase and inflammation Alongside the investigational COVID19 drugs, the patients may also be on therapeutics for comorbidities especially epidemiological studies have indicated that individuals with hypertension, hyperglycemia, and obesity are more vulnerable to COVID19 than the average population This complicates the drugdisease interaction profile of the patients as both the investigational drugs eg, remdesivir, dexamethasone and the agents for comorbidities can be affected by compromised CYPmediated hepatic metabolism Overall, it is imperative that healthcare professionals pay attention to the COVID19 and CYPdriven drug metabolism interactions with the goal to adjust the dose or discontinue the affected drugs as appropriate,We report the case of a 71yearold patient with many risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis, who underwent computed coronary angiography CTA, in accordance with the guidelines, for recent onset atypical chest pain CTA revealed critical 50 lumen diameter narrowing stenosis of the proximal anterior descending coronary, and the patient was scheduled for invasive coronary angiography ICA Before ICA he underwent enhanced transthoracic echoDoppler EDoppler TTE for coronary flow detection by colorguided pulsedwave Doppler recording of the left main LMCA and whole left anterior descending coronary artery LAD, along with coronary flow reserve CFR in the distal LAD calculated as the ratio, of peak flow velocity during iv adenosine 140 mcgKgm to resting flow velocity EDoppler TTE mapping revealed only mild stenosis 28 area narrowing of the mid LAD and a CFR of 320, in perfect agreement with the color mapping showing no flow limiting stenosis in the LMCA and LAD ICA revealed only a very mild stenosis in the mid LAD and mild atherosclerosis in the other coronaries intimal irregularities Thus, coronary stenosis was better predicted by EDoppler TTE than by CTA Coronary flow and reserve as assessed by EDoppler TTE trumps coronary anatomy as assessed by CTA, without exposing the patient to harmful radiation and iodinated contrast medium,BackgroundBeing a newly emerging disease, little is known about its longlasting postCOVID19 consequences The aim of this work is to assess the frequency, patterns, and determinants of persistent postCOVID19 symptoms and to evaluate the value of a proposed novel COVID19 symptom score Patients with confirmed COVID19 in a hospitalbased registry were included in a crosssectional study the hospitals including Assiut University Hospital, Assiut Chest Hospital, Aswan University Hospital, and Aswan Specialized Hospital The patient demographics, comorbid disorders, the mean duration since the onset of the symptoms, history of hospital or ICU admittance, and the treatment taken during the acute state, as well as symptom score before and after convalescence, were recordedResultsThe most frequent constitutional and neurological symptoms were myalgia 600, arthralgia 572, restriction of daily activities 570, and sleeping troubles 509, followed by anorexia 426, chest pain 326, gastritis 323, cough 293, and dyspnea 291 The mean total score of acute stage symptoms was 310  163 while postCOVID 19 symptom score was 131  126 P u200918 to predict occurrence of postCOVID19 symptomsConclusionsCOVID19 can present with a diverse spectrum of longterm postCOVID19 symptoms Increased acute phase symptom severity and COVID19 symptom score u200918 together with the presence of any comorbid diseases increase the risk for persistent postCOVID19 manifestations and severity,,Introduction Bronchial carcinoid tumors are rare, slow growing, malignant neuroendocrine tumors which arise from Enterochromaffin Kulchitsky cells Early diagnosis is extremely important as the main stay of treatment is surgical excision Presentation of case We present a rare case of bronchial typical carcinoid tumor in a 27yearold male who presented with a complaint of intermittent dry cough of 2 weeks duration associated with shortness of breath, low grade intermittent fever and loss of appetite He was initially misdiagnosed as covid19 pneumonia and was admitted to covid19 treatment center Right lung bilobectomy with regional lymph node resection was done and he was discharged home in good conditionDiscussion Majority of typical carcinoids are located in the central airways leading to bronchial obstruction with recurrent pneumonia, chest pain, wheezing and hemoptysis Due to such nonspecific presentation most patients are misdiagnosed or diagnosed late In the era of covid19 pandemic, in addition to the wide spread anxiety on the health care workers access to diagnostic work up of patients with rare diseases like bronchial carcinoids is very challenging especially in resource limited areas as invasive diagnostic procedures like bronchoscopy are usually avoided in covid19 suspected patients during the pandemic Although hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes are the most common metastatic sites for typical carcinoids most lymphadenopathies are caused by a reactive inflammatory reactionConclusion Bronchial carcinoids are rare, malignant neuroendocrine tumors with complete surgical resection being the only curative management Although the world is over burdened by Covid19 pandemic crisis, other lung pathologies are also still present in communities In such challenging circumstance diagnosing rare pulmonary diseases like bronchial carcinoids need high index of suspicion and meticulous diagnostic work up The outcome of typical carcinoids with lymph node metastasis is excellent with complete resection but close follow up is mandatory when dealing with larger tumors,,Studies on pharmacological mechanisms demonstrated that a strategy of dual reninangiotensin system RAS blockade may have a synergistic effect in the treatment of cardiorenal diseases and may reduce adverse reactions However, some previous clinical studies reported that dual RAS blockade did not significantly benefit many patients with cardiorenal diseases and increased the risk of hyperkalemia, hypotension and renal function damage Therefore, the current clinical guidelines suggest that the combined use of angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors ACEIs and angiotensin receptor blockers ARBs should be used with caution in the clinic However, these studies enrolled older patients with cardiovascular risk factors, and the results of these trials may not be generalized to the overall population Some clinical evidence suggests that the combination of lowdose ACEIs and ARBs leads to more effective RAS blockade with few adverse effects The advent of new RAS inhibitors with superior pharmacological effects provides a more suitable drug choice for individualized therapy for dual RAS blockade Therefore, the choice of appropriate ARBsACEIs for individualized therapy based on patient condition may be a better way to improve the efficiency and safety of the dual RAS blockade strategy,Respiratory diseases are frequently characterised by epithelial injury, airway inflammation, defective tissue repair, and airway remodelling This may occur in a subacute or chronic context, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or occur acutely as in pathogen challenge and acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS Despite the frequent challenge of lung homeostasis, not all pulmonary insults lead to disease Traditionally thought of as a quiescent organ, emerging evidence highlights that the lung has significant capacity to respond to injury by repairing and replacing damaged cells This occurs with the appropriate and timely resolution of inflammation and concurrent initiation of tissue repair programmes Airway epithelial cells are key effectors in lung homeostasis and host defence continual exposure to pathogens, toxins, and particulate matter challenge homeostasis, requiring robust defence and repair mechanisms As such, the epithelium is critically involved in the return to homeostasis, orchestrating the resolution of inflammation and initiating tissue repair This review examines the pivotal role of pulmonary airway epithelial cells in initiating and moderating tissue repair and restitution We discuss emerging evidence of the interactions between airway epithelial cells and candidate stem or progenitor cells to initiate tissue repair as well as with cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems in driving successful tissue regeneration Understanding the mechanisms of intercellular communication is rapidly increasing, and a major focus of this review includes the various mediators involved, including growth factors, extracellular vesicles, soluble lipid mediators, cytokines, and chemokines Understanding these areas will ultimately identify potential cells, mediators, and interactions for therapeutic targeting,CONTEXT Research priority guidelines highlight the need for examining the dose components of palliative care PC interventions, such as intervention adherence and completion rates, that contribute to optimal outcomes OBJECTIVES Examine the dose effect of PC intervention completion vs noncompletion on quality of life QoL and healthcare use in patients with advanced heart failure HF over 32 weeks METHODS Secondary analysis of the ENABLE CHFPC intervention trial for patients with New York Heart Association NYHA Class IIIIV HF Completers defined as completing a single, inperson outpatient palliative care consultation OPCC plus 6 weekly, PC nurse coachled telehealth sessions Noncompleters were defined as either not attending the OPCC or completing 6 telehealth sessions Outcome variables were QoL and healthcare resource use hospital days emergency department visits Mixed models were used to model dose effects for completers vs noncompleters over 32 weeks RESULTS Of 208 intervention group participants, 81 389 were classified as completers with a mean age of 646 years 728 were urbandwelling 925 had NYHA Class III HF Completers vs noncompleters groups were wellbalanced at baseline however noncompleters did report higher anxiety 60 vs 70, P  005, du202fu202f028 Moderate, clinically significant, improved QoL differences were found at 16 weeks in completers vs noncompleters betweengroup difference 971 318, du202fu202f047, P  0002 but not healthcare use CONCLUSION Higher intervention completion rates of an early PC intervention was associated with QoL improvements in patients with advanced HF Future work should focus on identifying the most efficacious dose of intervention components and increasing adherence to them TRIAL REGISTRATION ClinicalTrialsgov Identifier NCT02505425,Backgroundu2003 The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 is the pathogen responsible for the now pandemic disease, coronavirus disease COVID19 A number of reports have emerged suggesting these patients may present with signs and symptoms consistent with STsegment elevation myocardial infarction without coronary artery occlusion Case summaryu2003 We report an international case series of patients with confirmed COVID19 infection who presented with suspected STsegment elevation myocardial infarction Three patients with confirmed COVID19 presented with electrocardiogram criteria for STsegment elevation myocardial infarction No patient had obstructive coronary disease at coronary angiography Postmortem histology in one case demonstrated myocardial ischaemia in the absence of coronary atherothrombosis or myocarditis Discussionu2003 Patients with COVID19 may present with features consistent with STsegment elevation myocardial infarction and patent coronary arteries The prevalence and clinical outcomes of this condition require systematic investigation in consecutive unselected patients,Pulmonary interstitiopathies have become the most diagnosed forms of pneumonia in 2020 due to the COVID19 pandemic The spectrum of interstitiopathies is broad and includes idiopathic diseases and secondary forms In April 2020, a 36yearold man admitted to our department for arthralgias, fever, asthenia, cough, and dyspnea In January 2020 fever, cough, arthralgias and asthenia appeared In April, his general condition worsened with development of macrohematuria, malaise, and intense asthenia On admission, the patient presented pale, asthenic and symptomatic for dyspnea and arthralgias There was objective joint pain in the small joints of the hands, elbow, and knees with morning stiffness and decreased strength CT of the chest documented groundglass opacities in both lung fields He performed 2 swabs for SARSCoV2, which were negative On hematochemical examination IgM 332 mgdL and ferritin 7002 ngml At venous blood smear peripheral venous blood, agglutination of erythrocytes The serology IgM for M Pneumoniae was positive with agglutinins in the serum Doxaciclina was started There was a progressive normalization of hemoglobin levels and cold agglutinins were gradually reduced and were no longer detected at 15 days after the start of treatment At one month after discharge, pulmonary function had fully recovered and the picture of hemolytic anemia was resolved,The neutrophil, a shortlived effector leukocyte of the innate immune system best known for its proteases and other degradative cargo, has unique, reciprocal physiological interactions with the lung During health, large numbers of marginated neutrophils reside within the pulmonary vasculature, where they patrol the endothelial surface for pathogens and complete their life cycle Upon respiratory infection, rapid and sustained recruitment of neutrophils through the endothelial barrier, across the extravascular pulmonary interstitium, and again through the respiratory epithelium into the airspace lumen, is required for pathogen killing Overexuberant neutrophil trafficking to the lung, however, causes bystander tissue injury and underlies several acute and chronic lung diseases Due in part to the unique architecture of the lungs capillary network, the neutrophil follows a microanatomic passage into the distal airspace unlike that observed in other endorgans that it infiltrates Several of the regulatory mechanisms underlying the stepwise recruitment of circulating neutrophils to the infected lung have been defined over the past few decades however, fundamental questions remain In this article, we provide an updated review and perspective on emerging roles for the neutrophil in lung biology, on the molecular mechanisms that control the trafficking of neutrophils to the lung, and on past and ongoing efforts to design therapeutics to intervene upon pulmonary neutrophilia in lung disease,BackgroundThe truly popular consequence of management with the bloodthinningdrug, causation of lower bloodviscosity BV, is bleeding and very frequently asymptomatichemorrhage AH and the acuteheartfailure AHF happen without any preceding symptomsObjectivesOur aim was to develop an infallible closedform analytical model for demonstrating the proof of the concept of the Sanal flow choking in cardiovascular system CVS causing AH and AHF by correlating the blood pressure ratio BPR, biofluidbloodheatcapacityratioBHCR, blood viscosityBV, stenosis in terms of vessel crosssectional area VCA and ejection fractionEF For establishing the proof of the concept we were planned in vitro and in silico studiesxa0xa0MethodsThe closedformanalyticalmethodology is used herein to establish the proof of the concept of Sanalflowchoking In vitro method is invoked for the speciation analyses of blood samples of healthy subjects human beingGuinea pig for the BHCR estimation In silico method is used for demonstrating the asymptomatic pressureovershoot in an artery due to the Sanal flow choking and shock wave generationxa0ResultsThe closedform analytical, in vitro and in silico results are presented herein to establish the proof of the concept of internal flow choking in CVS causing cardiovascular risk without prejudice to the percutaneous coronary interventionxa0PCI The analytical models reveal that the relatively high and low BV are risk factors of AH and AHF In vitro study shows that nitrogenN2, oxygenO2, carbon dioxideCO2 and argonAr gases are predominant in freshblood samples of the healthy humanbeing and Guineapig at a temperature range of 37400 C 9861040 F, which increases the risk of flowchoking leading to AH and AHF The thermaltolerance level in terms of BHCR of Guineapig is found higher than the human being In silico results demonstrated the Sanal flow choking and shock wave generation in an artery with the divergentbifurcation regionxa0xa0ConclusionsAn overdose of bloodthinning drug for reducing the bloodviscosityBV augments Reynolds number leading to highturbulence and enhanced boundarylayerblockageBLB, which increases the chances of cavitation and the Sanalflowchoking leading to the shock wave and pressureovershoot causing memory effect stroke history in viscoelastic vessels Designing the precise bloodthinning regimen is vital for attaining the desired therapeutic efficacy and negating undesirable flowchoking leading to AH and AHF Herein we established that the disproportionate bloodthinning treatment increases the risk of the Sanalflowchoking due to the enhanced BLB factor The cardiovascular risk could be diminished by concurrently lessening the BV and flow turbulence by rising thermaltolerancelevel in terms of BHCR or by decreasing the BPRxa0Condensed AbstractHerein, we provide a proof of the concept to establish that such asymptomatic diseases are due to the boundarylayerblockage BLB induced flow choking Sanalflowchoking at a critical bloodpressureratio BPR When the pressure of the nanoscalefluid increases, averagemeanfreepath decreases and thus, the Knudsen number reduces leading to a noslip boundary condition with compressibleviscous CV flow effect Sanalflowchoking is a CV flow effect creating a physical situation of the sonicfluidthroat, at a critical BPR We concluded that AH and AHF are transientevents due to flowchoking, and not an illness xa0The cardiovascular risk could be diminished by concurrently lessening the BV and flow turbulence by rising thermaltolerancelevel in terms of BHCR or by decreasing the BPR,Background Sudden cardiac arrest is one of the leading causes of death globally The recommended clinical management in outofhospital cardiac arrest cases is the immediate initiation of highquality Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation CPR Training mannequins should be combined with technology that provide students with detailed immediate feedback on the quality of CPR performance This study aimed to verify the impacts of the type of feedback basic or detailed the responders receive from the device while learning CPR and how it influences the quality of their performance and the motivation to improve their skillsMethods The study was conducted at the Medical University of Lublin among 694 multi professional health students during first aid classes on Basic Life Support BLS The students first practiced on an adult mannequin with a basic control panel afterward, the same mannequin was connected to a laptop, ensuring a detailed record of the performed activities through a projector Next, the participants expressed their subjective opinion on how the feedback provided during the classes, basic vs detailed, motivated them to improve the quality of their CPR performance Additionally, during the classes, the instructor conducted an extended observation of students work and behaviorResults In the students opinion, the CPR training with detailed feedback devices provided motivation for learning and improving CPR proficiency than the one with a basic control panel Furthermore, the comments given from devices seem to be more acceptable to the students, who did not see any bias in the devices evaluation compared to that of the instructorConclusions Detailed device feedback motivates student health practitioners to learn and improve the overall quality of CPR The use of mannequins that provide detailed feedback during BLS courses can improve survival in outofhospital cardiac arrest,COVID19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 SARSCoV2 is associated with significant cardiovascular dysfunction in patients with, and without, preexisting cardiovascular disease 1 There are now welldocumented cardiac complications of COVID19 infection which include myocarditis, heart failure, and acute coronary syndrome 2 There is growing evidence showing that arrhythmias are also one of the major complications of COVID19 We report a patient with no known cardiac conduction disease who presented with syncope, positive SARSCoV2 PCR, who was persistently bradycardic and subsequently developed sinus node dysfunction SND To date, there are a limited number of reports of sinus node dysfunction SND associated with COVID19 We describe the clinical characteristics, potential pathophysiologic mechanisms and management of COVID19 patients who experienced de novo SND,Background With the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 epidemic, remote monitoring of patients with implanted cardiac devices has become more important than ever, as physical distancing measures have placed limits on inclinic device monitoring Remote monitoring alerts, particularly those associated with heart failure trends, have proved useful in guiding care in regard to monitoring fluid status and adjusting heart failure medications Case summary This report describes use of Boston Scientifics HeartLogic algorithm, which is a multisensor device algorithm in implantable cardioverterdefibrillator devices that is proven to be an early predictor of heart failure decompensation by measuring several variables, including respiratory rate, nighttime heart rate, and heart sounds We present three cases of patients who were actively surveilled by the various HeartLogic device algorithm sensors and were identified to have increasing respiratory rates high enough to trigger a HeartLogic alert prior to a positive COVID19 diagnosis Discussion We propose that the HeartLogic algorithm and its accompanying individual physiologic sensors demonstrate potential for use in identifying nonheart failurerelated decompensation, such as COVID19positive diagnoses,Many newly published articles have focused on the association between COVID19 and thrombogenicity Indeed, it has become a frequently observed phenomena In this study, we report on a 45yearold man with a COVID19positive test His dramatic progression started 5 days after admission He developed a right ventricular RV thrombus rare condition and multiple brain sites infarction We discuss this phenomena by showing the extent to which the thrombosis can take place, the possible relation between inflammatory, Ddimer and case progression and suggest a treatment approach particularly in cases with multiple thrombogenicity organ involvement\n"
